At birth, there is a switch from fetal hemoglobin to adult hemoglobin          Fetal: α and γ chains      Adult: α and β chains        There are two copies of the α gene on each copy of chromosome 16.  There is one copy of the β gene on each copy of chromosome 11.Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)  Defined by the E6V (glutamic acid to valine) mutation on the β gene on Chr 11.  In deoxygenated states (low oxygen conditions), this valine is exposed, which causes the hemoglobin to polymerize.          Leads to characteristic ‘sickling’ pattern.      Sickling is irreversible → leads to a permanently abnormal RBC.      Presentation of SCD  Fetal hemoglobin is α2γ2, so it does not have the mutated β gene.  However, as fetal hemoglobin transitions adult hemoglobin by 4 months, it presents as anemia.- This can be detected with a higher than expected fetal hemoglobin and/or high reticulocyte count as the body compensatesClinical presentation of SCD  Moderate → severe anemia.  Vaso-occlusive crisis          Severe pain related to sickle cells causing clotting and obstruction of vessels.      Release of inflammatory mediators.      Destruction due to injury and hypoxia.        Stroke / CNS events  Priapism, blood will not leave penis due to clotting.  Spleen infarcts and is destroyed.- *Lack of spleen* leads to *hindered development of immune system*.- Thus SCD can cause *infections* and death due to *immunocompromise*.Treatment and Care  Treatment with hydroxyurea (HU).          Turns on fetal (αγ) hemoglobin by suppressing β chain expression      HU is also anti-inflammatory.      It normalizes the transcranial doppler (see below).        Note      Once a patient has had a stroke, HU is much less effective at preventing complications.    At this point, the patient will be transfusion dependent.    Palliation → oxygenation and narcotics.- Make sure that narcotic use is discontinued when pain is gone to prevent addiction. - Establish normal values for child &amp;rarr; a Hb of 80 might be normal in the patient. - Educate family about disease. - *Monitor for evidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack*.- Damage to brain leading to vision or hearing loss.- Use *Transcranial Doppler* to assess if there's turbulent blood flow in the *Circle of Willis*.		- By 18, there is an 11% risk of stroke if untreated. - Immunizations, given their immunosuppression.ThalassemiaClassifications of Alpha Thalassemia  Recall, 4 copies total of hemoglobin α chain in genome.  So α-thalassemias are classified by genotype → the number of defective genes there are.            # defective genes      Classification      Functional Status                  1 α gene defective      Silent Carrier      Normal              2 α genes defective      Thalassemia trait      Mild anemia              3 α genes defective      HbH disease      Severe anemia              4 α genes defective      Hydrops fetalis      death in utero, termination of pregnancy      Classifications of Beta Thalassemia  Based on phenotype.          Not gene status, unlike α Thalassemia      A person with defective β gene could be normal, or very sick                  Classification      Functional Status                  Silent Carrier      Normal              Thalassemia trait      Mild anemia              Thalassemia intermedia      Low, but acceptable hemoglogbin              Thalassemia major      Transfusion dependent      Presentation of Thalassemias  Microcytic, hypochromic, and target RBCs on the peripheral blood smear.  Patients will be anemic, have low energy.  Bone changes, esp. in face.          Overproductive bone marrow, overcompensating to produce RBCs.      Facial bones will swell with marrow.        Hepatosplenomegaly → the liver and spleen are larger due to clearance of RBCs and infarcting of the spleen.Management of Thalassemias  Stem cell therapy is not fully supported for either thalassmia or SCD (No RCTs)  The mainstay treatment is transfusion:          Thalassemia major and usually HbH → transfusion dependent.      Thalassemia intermedia and sometimes HbH → occasional transfusion.        Transfusion complications      Chronic transfusions lead to iron overload:              Endocrine dysfunction, cardiac failure, growth failure        Recall: the body does not have a good mechanism to get rid of iron (except menstruation in women)              Solutions to Iron Overload      Donating blood (harder to control, less feasible)    Drug therapy    - **Desferal**	- Requires continuous transfusion for 12h/day.	- Adherence is low in teenage age group.- **Deferasirox**	- Oral medication, better adherence.Why do these hemoglobinopathies exist in the genome?  Heterozygotes for thalassemias and SCD are protected from complications of malaria.- Physiology is not well understood. - These diseases are prevalent among people who come from the 'malaria belt'.- You will likely encounter people immigrating from these areas!Summary Chart            Disease      Blood Findings      Timing of presentation      Treatment      Complications                  Thalassemia      Target cells      Presentation in newborns      Blood Transfusion      Bony overgrowth, growth failure, heart failure              Sickle Cell Disease      Sickled cells      Presentation at ~4 months      Primarily Hydroxyurea      Painful crises, stroke, infection        Summary      In Thalassemia, transfusions need to be managed for iron overload with medication.    In SCD, prevention of complications with hydroxyurea to prevent transfusion dependence is key.

In order from least dense to most dense, we have:          Plasma      Buffy Coat → WBCs + platelets.      Red Blood Cells → RBCs.        The hematocrit (Hct or Ht), is defined as:  This is the relative amount of your blood that is comprised of red blood cells.  Typical values are from 40-45%.

In utero, the yolk sac is the first site of hematopoiesis.  At around 5-6 weeks gestation, the liver and spleen become the primary source of hematopoiesis.          They remain as such until around the 3rd trimester.        The bone marrow starts becoming active at around 3 months, and becomes the major source of hematopoiesis from 5-6 months onward.          Conventionally, it is thought that the bone marrow becomes the sole source of hematopoiesis after this point, but in some diseases where the bone marrow is damaged, you can actually see blood production in the spleen and liver again!      The idea is that the stem cells can actually migrate to these previous sources of hematopoiesis.        Important      Will be on the exam!    The yolk sac is the first site of hematopoiesis.    The liver and spleen become the main source of hematopoiesis at 5-6 weeks gestation.    The bone marrow starts at around 3 months, and becomes the major source of hematopoiesis by 7 months.  Regulation of Hematopoiesis  The production of blood components has a high degree of turnover → approximately 1 trillion cells/day.          Because of this high turnover, the blood is at risk for dysfunctional growth regulation, which will be seen later in this block.        Production is responsive to cytokines, which can increase the production of certain cell lineages.          Hypoxia leads to the release of the cytokine EPO (Erythropoietin), which ↑RBCs.      Infection leads to the release of GCSF (Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor), which ↑neutrophils.      Hemorrhage leads to the release of thrombopoietin, which ↑platelets.      The Process of Hematopoiesis  Hematopoiesis starts with HSCs.  HSC → Hematopoietic Stem Cell.          These are blood cell progenitors, and they exist in a small pool (~0.1% of the bone marrow, ~0.01% of the peripheral blood).      These are pluripotent → HSCs generate all blood cells (RBCs, WBCs, platelets).        Important → To be a stem cell, 2 features must be satisfied:          Pluripotent → can generate multiple cell lineages.      Capacity for self-renewal → ie. they’re ‘immortal’.        HSCs are a quiescent pool of cells → only ~5% are dividing at any point in time.  To ‘self renew’, these cells are maintained by asymmetric division:  Stem Cell Criteria      Will be on the exam!    To be a stem cell, 2 features must be satisfied:              Pluripotent → can generate multiple cell lineages.        Capacity for self-renewal → ie. they’re ‘immortal’.              It’s important to differentiate pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, from totipotent embryonic stem cells:          Totipotent (embryonic) → can regenerate the entire organism.       Pluripotent (eg. HSCs) → can regenerate multiple lineages. Can’t regenerate everything, but they can regenerate a lot.                  Adult tissues can be induced to become pluripotent stems cells (Shinya Yamanaka’s ground-breaking research on iPSCs).                       Growth regulation typically occurs at the committed CFU stage (this is where EPO acts, for instance).          CFU = colony forming unit.      At the committed CFU stage, the HSC has already ‘committed’ itself to a single cell lineage.      It makes sense for growth regulation to occur at this stage, since you don’t want amplification of non-specific cells!        As differentiation progresses, cell-type specificity increases:          HSC → lymphoid progenitor → lymphocytes.      HSC → myeloid progenitor → platelets, red cells, monocytes.      Clinical Correlates of Stem Cell Dysfunction  Loss of HSCs → aplastic anemia, where you have a loss of all cell lineages. Often as a result of severe radiation.  Loss of committed CFUs → eg. pure red cell aplasia (loss of RBCs only), or chronic neutropenia (rare).  Problems with stem cells are often treated with stem cell transplantation (ie. a bone marrow transplant).  If you have malignant/clonal expansion of HSCs or differentiated committed CFUs, you end up with blood cancers.  Cancer proliferation can be monoclonal or polyclonal:          Monoclonal = cancer arose from one ‘clone’ only.      Polyclonal = cancer has arisen from multiple ‘clones’, which makes it harder to treat. Polyclonal cancers typically arise due to accelerated rates of mutagenesis.
