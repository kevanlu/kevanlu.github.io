DevelopmentSites of fetal erythropoiesisyolk sac &#8594; liver &#8594; spleen &#8594; bone marrow.At birth, there is a switch from fetal hemoglobin to adult hemoglobinFetal: &#945; and &#947; chainsAdult: &#945; and &#946; chainsThere are two copies of the &#945; gene on each copy of chromosome 16.There is one copy of the &#946; gene on each copy of chromosome 11.Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)Defined by the E6V (glutamic acid to valine) mutation on the β gene on Chr 11.In deoxygenated states (low oxygen conditions), this valine is exposed, which causes the hemoglobin to polymerize.Leads to characteristic &#8216;sickling&#8217; pattern.Sickling is irreversible &#8594; leads to a permanently abnormal RBC.Presentation of SCDFetal hemoglobin is &#945;2&#947;2, so it does not have the mutated &#946; gene.However, as fetal hemoglobin transitions adult hemoglobin by 4 months, it presents as anemia.This can be detected with a higher than expected fetal hemoglobin and/or high reticulocyte count as the body compensatesClinical presentation of SCDModerate &#8594; severe anemia.Vaso-occlusive crisisSevere pain related to sickle cells causing clotting and obstruction of vessels.Release of inflammatory mediators.Destruction due to injury and hypoxia.Stroke / CNS eventsPriapism, blood will not leave penis due to clotting.Spleen infarcts and is destroyed.Lack of spleen leads to hindered development of immune system.Thus SCD can cause infections and death due to immunocompromise.Treatment and CareTreatment with hydroxyurea (HU).Turns on fetal (&#945;&#947;) hemoglobin by suppressing &#946; chain expressionHU is also anti-inflammatory.It normalizes the transcranial doppler (see below).NoteOnce a patient has had a stroke, HU is much less effective at preventing complications.At this point, the patient will be transfusion dependent.Palliation &#8594; oxygenation and narcotics.Make sure that narcotic use is discontinued when pain is gone to prevent addiction.Establish &#8220;normal&#8221; values for child &#8594; a Hb of 80 might be normal in the patient.Educate family about disease.Monitor for evidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack.Damage to brain leading to vision or hearing loss.Use Transcranial Doppler to assess if there&#8217;s turbulent blood flow in the Circle of Willis.By 18, there is an 11% risk of stroke if untreated.Immunizations, given their immunosuppression.ThalassemiaClassifications of Alpha ThalassemiaRecall, 4 copies total of hemoglobin &#945; chain in genome.So &#945;-thalassemias are classified by genotype &#8594; the number of defective genes there are.# defective genesClassificationFunctional Status1 &#945; gene defectiveSilent CarrierNormal2 &#945;

the liver and spleen are larger due to clearance of RBCs and infarcting of the spleen.Management of ThalassemiasStem cell therapy is not fully supported for either thalassmia or SCD (No RCTs)The mainstay treatment is transfusion:Thalassemia major and usually HbH &#8594; transfusion dependent.Thalassemia intermedia and sometimes HbH &#8594; occasional transfusion.Transfusion complicationsChronic transfusions lead to iron overload:Endocrine dysfunction, cardiac failure, growth failureRecall: the body does not have a good mechanism to get rid of iron (except menstruation in women)Solutions to Iron OverloadDonating blood (harder to control, less feasible)Drug therapyDesferalRequires continuous transfusion for 12h/day.Adherence is low in teenage age group.DeferasiroxOral medication, better adherence.Why do these hemoglobinopathies exist in the genome?Heterozygotes for thalassemias and SCD are protected from complications of malaria.Physiology is not well understood.These diseases are prevalent among people who come from the &#8216;malaria belt&#8217;.You will likely encounter people immigrating from these areas!Summary ChartDiseaseBlood FindingsTiming of presentationTreatmentComplicationsThalassemiaTarget cellsPresentation in newbornsBlood TransfusionBony overgrowth, growth failure, heart failureSickle Cell DiseaseSickled cellsPresentation at ~4 monthsPrimarily HydroxyureaPainful crises, stroke, infectionSummaryIn Thalassemia, transfusions need to be managed for iron overload with medication.In SCD, prevention of complications with hydroxyurea to prevent transfusion dependence is key.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/blood/2013/10/18/sickle-cell-hemoglobinopathies.html"},
