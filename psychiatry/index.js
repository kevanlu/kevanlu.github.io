LDs across the lifespan.Introduction to Learning Disabilities  Learning disability is a neurological disorder.          It arises from neurological differences in brain structure and function.      They affect a person’s ability to receive, store, process, retrieve, or communicate information.  The archetypical example is with Albert Einstein, who couldn’t read until he was 9 years old. Another example is President John F. Kennedy, who also had a reading disability.      Learning disability ≠ intellectual disability.                  A learning disability doesn’t reflect a decrease in an underlying ability to learn, unlike an intellectual disability.          Rather, it reflects a problem in reaching your innate potential.                      In Ontario, the communication of a LD diagnosis is controlled under the RHPA (Regulated Health Professionals Act).          As a result, only qualified members of the College of Psychologists and the CPSO can make the diagnosis of a LD.        Prevalence of LDs → around 3.2% of Canadian children.Etiology of Learning Disabilities  The etiology of learning disabilities is still not well understood.  Some possible factors include:          Prenatal and obstetric insults (eg. maternal malnutrition, low birth weight, oxygen deprivation).      Post natal events (traumatic injuries, severe nutritional deprivation).      Genetics → LDs occur with considerable frequency within members of the same family.        Objective      Diagnostic criteria for a Learning Disability (LD).  Diagnosis of Learning Disorders  There are 2 diagnostic criteria that we’ll be looking at:          DSM-5 Criteria.      LDAO (Learning Disabilities Association of Ontario) Criteria.        DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria:          Specific Learning Disorder:  The part adding the requirement for intervention is a new addition in the DSM-5.                  A persistent difficulty learning academic skills for at least 6 months despite intervention targeting the area(s) of difficulty.          Affected academic skills are span style=”color:red”&gt;substantially below expectations&lt;/span&gt; given the individual’s age.          The LD is readily apparent in the early years.          There is no more likely cause, including:                          Intellectual disability.              Visual of hearing impairments.              Neurological disorders.              Psycho-social difficulties.              Language differences (eg. ESL).              Lack of access to adequate instruction.                                          LDAO = Learning Disabilities Association of Ontario.- Has existed for a couple of decades now, and has been refined over the years.- Needs to have at least average IQ.- Also needs to have significant academic under-achievement in 1+ domains (reading, writing, math, language.	- What is significant academic underachievement? Below 1 SD.- Must be related to/explained by psych process.What’s the difference between LDAO and DSM-5?Major difference listed here.LDAO requires ID of processing deficit.Assessment of LDs  Will be focusing on LDAO diagnosis, since it’s the one required by school boards, and it’s the one that’ll be most relevant in practice.PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT focus.Obtain sufficient info on (1) intellectual ability, (2) academic functioning, and (3) function in each processing area.Academic functioning is assessed by standardized tests in reading, writing, math and language.Weschler Individual Achievement Test- IIIAssessment of Cognitive Abilities.IQ test. WISC.Not only measures IQ, but also gives you some processing area info.Additional tests need to be done for all other areas:- Memory- Phonological processing, etc.A synthesis of these 3, in addition to your history, generates your diagnosis.CO-MORBID CONDITIONSWhat other factors might influence learning?Most common co-morbid Dx is ADHD.Estimated that ~1/2 of patients with LD also have ADHD.Important to determine if the ADHD is primary or secondary.	- Primary: ADHD in and of itself.	- Secondary: difficulties paying attention secondary to the fact that they’re having difficulties processing info.	- Intervention varies depending on this. Primary ADHD has more pharmacological intervention compared to secondary ADHD.- Anxiety DIsorder: 10-30%; also determine if primary or secondary.- Depression.  Objective      Types of LDs.    Focus on the early indicators of each of these learning disabilities.// DyslexiaIf basic skills affected, ID’d early.If advanced skills affected, ID’d later.Examples:- Reading could be slow and laborious.- Basic test: compare comprehension hearing it versus reading it.- You’ll find that auditory processing substantially higher than visual processing.//Writing DisabilityPoor spatial planning on paper.Will have difficulty thinking and writing at the same time. So things like note-taking will be especially challenging.//Math Disability (Dyscalculia)Confusions with symbols (+, -, x, etc)//Language DisabilitySOmetimes debate as to whether a language disability is a LD or not.in The DSM, it’s a separate category. LDAO has it in same category.Ultimately it doesn’t matter, since assessment and intervention is the same regardless.BUt it only fits in given that reading, writing, math, and language are the 4 axes of learning.SLP!Role of Primary Care Physician?Early ID and referral for assessment.Important given the life-long nature of LD (no cure), and the increasing learning gap that occurs if left untreated.School often the first to express concerns.- Persistent academic difficulties -&gt; red flags.- Early signs in preschool yerars:	- Delayed language dev.	- Articulation difficulties.	- Fine motor skills slow to develop.- Consider referal to other specialists:In School, ID’d as exceptional learning, legally school board is obligated to provide best intervention possible if child Dx with learning disability.If no Dx, first process looks similar. Sometimes someone is ID’d as having difficulty in subject area, but no processing deficits. They won’t receive a diagnosis, but is still allowed to have informal IEPs.OR if learning disability is found but academic performance is meeting expectations… in these, MONITOR, they might actually be very bright, and they’ll be compensating for the disability!!!InterventionAcademic and psychological.Strategies for academic remediation.Accomodation for processing deficits.Older age, focus less on improving function, and more on accomodations.OLDER ADULTS (LESS COMMON)Job accomodations.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/psychiatry/2015/04/29/learning-disablities.html"},
	{"title": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define the criteria for a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.  State the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Describe the treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder.Lecture Overview  Diagnosis of ASD.  Epidemiology of ASD.  Etiology of ASD.  Management of ASD.Diagnosis of ASD  Objective      Define the criteria for a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.  As an aside, between the DSM-IV and DSM-5, there was a switch from roman numerals to numbers to better facilitate the appending of ‘point updates’. For instance, DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2, etc.  In DSM-IV, a diagnosis of ASD required the follow triad of features:          Impaired social interactions.      Abnormal language development.      Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour.        In DSM-5, this has been simplified to the following 2 features:          Deficits in communication.      Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour.        To show (1), deficits in communication, you require ALL 3 OF:          Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity.                  For instance, reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect.          Failure to initiate or respond to social interactions; parents may sometimes describe communication with their child like an ‘interrogation’; when you ask them a question, they’ll answer back, and nothing more.                    Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction.                  For instance, reduced or increased eye contact, body language deficits, a lack of facial expressions, or a reduced ability to understand and use gestures.                    Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships appropriate to developmental level.                  For example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.                      To show (2), restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour, you require ≥ 2 OF:          Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech.                  Examples include lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia (meaningless repetition of another person’s words; ‘echoing’ them), idiosyncratic phrases.                    Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behaviour.                  Examples include extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, or the need to take same route or eat same food every day.  Note that these fixed interests are NOT the obsessions seen with OCD. Here, these fixations aren’t anxiety provoking, while the obsessions seen with OCD are.                    Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus.                  For instance, strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests.                    Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment.                  For instance, apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse responses to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement.                      In addition to the above, you also require the following:          Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period.      Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment.  This is particularly important when ruling out ID. The lower you go in IQ, the more difficult it is to distinguish between ASD and ID. In the DSM-5, in order to make a comorbid diagnosis of both ASD + ID, you require impaired social communication beyond that which is expected by the ID alone      Symptoms are not better accounted for by another cause, such as:                  Intellectual Disability          Language Disorder          ADHD          Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia, OCD)                      See this CDC website with Diagnostic Criteria for ASD.  Diagnostic Criteria for ASD      Deficits in communication → must satisfy ALL 3 OF:              Deficits in socio-emotional reciprocity.        Deficits in non-verbal communication.        Deficits in developing and maintaining relationships (appropriate to their developmental level)              Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour. → must satisfy ≥ 2 OF:              Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech.        Insistence on sameness, adherence to routines, ritualized behaviour.        Highly restricted, fixated interests.        Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, or abnormal interest in sensory elements.              Additional (obvious) requirements:              Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period.        Must cause a clinically significant impairment.        Symptoms not better explained by another cause.            Assessment for ASD  Screening instruments should be used to suggest further evaluation, and NOT TO MAKE A DIAGNOSIS:          There is no substitute for good clinical observation and judgement.      These screening tools are good for ruling ASD out, but not for ruling ASD in.      Examples of screening instruments for ASD include:                  Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ).          Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS).          Gillian Autism Rating Scale (DO NOT USE).                      An ideal assessment process involves the following:          A developmental history from the parents.      Collateral information from the school/daycare.      Direct observation of the child.      Speech and language assessment to r/o a language disorder.      Cognitive assessment to r/o ID.      Epidemiology of ASD  Objective      State the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder.    Prevalence among 8 year olds = 1.47% (1/68)          Just like with ID, this is ‘around 1%’.        Autism is more common in males than females:          M:F ratio = 4.5:1.      In males, the prevalence of ASD is 2.4%.      In females, the prevalence of ASD is 0.5%.        31% have intellectual disability, and 20% have seizures.  The prevalence of ASD is increasing:            It’s thought that the increase may be due to changing to changes in reporting practices, or a change in diagnostic criteria.      In the US, the rise in prevalence is closely linked to the date where ASD became a ‘codable’ disability that could be used to receive monetary educational support (1991).      Etiology of ASD  We’ll be looking at:          Neurobiological factors.      Genetic factors.      Psychological factors.      Environmental factors.      Neurobiology of ASD  ASD is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder (ie. it’s caused by abnormal development of the brain, rather than degeneration or a specific lesion).  Children with ASD have larger brain sizes:  The image on the right is from a case-control study looking retrospectively at the head circumferences from children with ASD. Their head circumference was normal at birth, but rose significantly in their first year of life.          Several studies have found that patients with ASD have increased head circumference.       In fact, up to 20% of patients with ASD may have head circumferences above the 97th percentile (where statistically, only 3% should be expected).      Autopsy studies also suggest that some patients have increased brain weights.      These findings have been corroborated with MRI studies in the past decade.        This is somewhat unusual; most significant psychiatric and neurological disorders are associated with slightly smaller brains (eg. schizophrenia, bipolar, ADHD).Genetics of ASD  ‘Unaffected’ relatives of those with autism have slightly higher rates of social/language/behavioural problems.          This suggests a genetic component to ASD.      10-15% of patients with ASD have copy number changes (deletions and duplications).        Anyone with a diagnosis of ASD should have genetic testing with a clinical microarray.  Remember      With both ID and ASD, anyone with a positive diagnosis should have genetic testing with a clinical microarray.  Psychological Factors in ASD  What the actual ‘deficit’ seen in ASD is controversial.  The predominant theory is that patients with ASD lack a theory of mind → the ability to understand other people’s thought processes and to make inferences about the thoughts of others.Environmental Factors in ASD  Much has been written in recent years about vaccinations being a ‘cause’ of autism, either directly from the MMR vaccine or from mercury being used as a preservative.  Epidemiological studies suggest that there is absolutely no relationship between autism and vaccinations.Management of ASD  Objective      Describe the treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder.    There’s not much to say about treatment of ASD, because there isn’t a treatment.          We can treat the behavioural problems associated with ASD, but we can’t treat the ASD itself.        The only reasonably well validated treatment for ASD is a behavioural one, called Intensive Behavioural Intervention (IBI).          Involves an intensive intervention (at least 20 hours per week!!!) for children with autism spectrum disorder      Conceptualized as a comprehensive intervention, designed to teach multiple skills and abilities.      The goal of IBI is to increase developmental trajectory, which means that it has to be started at a young age.      Several studies indicate that IBI can be beneficial for some children with autism spectrum disorder.      Not everyone responds to IBI; it seems to be more effective with those with milder ASD and/or better cognitive function.

	{"title": "Intellectual Disability", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define the criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.  List the most common preventable causes of intellectual disability  Describe the management of someone with intellectual disability.Lecture Overview  Diagnosis of intellectual disability.  Epidemiology of intellectual disability.  Etiology of intellectual disability.  Management of intellectual disability.Diagnosis of Intellectual Disability  Objective      Define the criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.    Intellectual Disability → formerly called mental retardation, but this was changed due to political incorrectness.  This is not a single disorder, but rather a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by:          Significantly below average intelligence.      Deficits in adaptive functioning.        Intellectual Disability      A diagnosis of intellectual disability requires:              Deficits in intellectual functions (IQ &lt; 70).        Deficits in adaptive functioning.              How do you assess a deficit in inellectual function?  Most social science tests result in a normal distribution with a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of 15. Hence, an IQ &lt; 70 suggests that the patient is more than 2 SD below the mean.          Standardized intelligence test resulting in an IQ &lt; ~70 (more than 2 SD less than the mean).      Common tests include:                  Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (ages 6-16).          Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale (ages 16+).                      How do you assess a deficit in adaptive function?          A deficit in adaptive functioning means that the person fails to meet developmental and sociocultural standards.      Generally speaking, if you have an intellectual deficit, you usually have an adaptive deficit as well.        Global Developmental Delay:          Global Developmental Delay → refers to individuals &lt; 5 who fail to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning.      Historically, this was a term used in pediatrics for patients who had slowed development, but they (1) didn’t want to or (2) were unable to undergo testing to make a diagnosis of intellectual disability.      In DSM-5, this term is used for a patient &lt; 5 with impaired adaptive function, but where there was no intelligence test performed (yet).        Global Developmental Delay      Global Developmental Delay → patients &lt; 5, where there is impaired adaptive function, but no intelligence test has been performed.    Hence, this is more of a stopgap diagnosis before a formal diagnosis of intellectual disability.  Epidemiology of Intellectual Disability  Overall, around 1% of the population is affected, although this does vary across and within countries.          IMPORTANT → in any psychiatry exam, if you see any question asking for the prevalence of a psychiatric illness, 1% is almost always the right answer.        If we made our prevalence prediction based on the &gt; 2 SD below the mean threshold that’s used, statistically speaking, around 2.5% of the population should have been affected.  So where did the other 1.5% go?          The decrease is probably due to increased early mortality due to comorbidities associated with intellectual disability.      Note that the rate of ID varies with age, and intellectual disability is less common in adults than it is in children and adolescents.      The only reasons why this would be the case, is that (1) people get smarter as they age (not likely), or (2) younger people with intellectual disability die earlier than those without a disability.        A US study by the CDC suggested that the rate of ID in the states is about 0.7%.  They also noted a few correlations:  These associations are likely due to genetic factors.          Prevalence of ID is related to maternal education:                  Less than high school → 0.93%          High school → 0.7%.          College/university graduate → 0.48%.                    Prevalence of ID is related to family income:                  Family income &lt; twice the poverty level → 1.03%.          Family income &gt; twice the poverty level → 0.5%.                      Because ID can be caused by a variety of syndromes, patients often have comorbidities:          10% have hearing impairments.      33% of those with severe ID and 5-15% with mild ID have seizures.      30-60% with severe ID have cerebral palsy.        Epidemiology of Intellectual Disability      About 1% of the population is affected.    ID is less common with increasing maternal education, and increasing family income.  Etiology of Intellectual Disability  The lower the IQ, the more likely that there was an identified cause for the ID:          The most severe forms of ID are almost always associated with a cause (~75% with severe ID).        Causes of intellectual disability can be categorized into 3 groups:          Genetic.      Teratogens.      Postnatal causes.      1. Genetic Causes  Inherited:          Intelligence shows a significant degree of heritability (in studies involving monozygotic twins reared in different environments, their IQ correlation was 0.75).        Chromosome abnormalities:          Many genetic syndromes are associated with ID (&gt; 500).      As a result, the Canadian Pediatric Association now recommends that anyone with a diagnosis of ID should have genetic testing with a clinical microarray.      Example → Down’s Syndrome → most common single cause of ID. Most commonly caused by trisomy 21.	         Single Gene Disorders          Example → Fragile X Syndrome → most common inherited cause of ID (2nd most common cause overall).      Fragile X syndrome is a trinucleotide repeat disorder involving a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene at Xq27.3.      FMR1 stands for Fragile X mental retardation 1, which codes the FMRP protein (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein), which is involved in neural development.        Common Genetic Causes of Intellectual Disability      Down’s Syndrome → most common single cause of ID.    Fragile X Syndrome → most common inherited cause of ID.    Down’s syndrome is most commonly caused by trisomy 21, while Fragile X syndrome is a trinucleotide repeat disorder involving a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene at Xq27.3.  2. Teratogens  A variety of teratogenic entities are associated with ID.          Recall our Drug Exposure in Pregnancy lecture from Reproduction.        Common Teratogens include:          Medications (particularly valproic acid and phenytoin).      Substances (particularly alcohol).      Radiation.      Infections (rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV)      3. Postnatal Causes  About 3.5% of children with mental retardation are thought to have postnatal etiologies.  These include bacterial meningitis, encephalitis, strokes, tumours, injury, and child abuse.Management of Intellectual Disability  Objective      Describe the management of someone with intellectual disability.    There’s no pharmacological treatment for intellectual disability or ASD per se.          Treatment is instead aimed at reducing the behaviour that interfere with the individual’s daily functioning.      The mainstays of education are education, behavioural modification, speech therapy; medications should be used sparingly.        Pharmacotherapy is targeted towards treating:          Aggression.      Inattention and hyperactivity.      Aggression  We usually see two patterns of aggression or self injurious behaviour:          Minimally related to environmental cues:                  Thought to be a variant of a tic disorder, or compulsion.          Less responsive to medication.                    Related to environmental cues (more common):                  These are often precipitated by frustration.          More responsive to medication.                      Treatments include:          Antipsychotics.      Anticonvulsants/lithium.  Note that stimulants aren’t named as such because they increase activity. Rather, it’s because they stimulate catecholamine transmission; it has nothing to do with their behavioural effects.      Stimulants (eg. Ritalin).      Atomoxetine.      Other → electric shock therapy.      Inattention and Hyperactivity  Commonly associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder.          One study suggested at least 50% of children with ASD also met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD.        Treatments include:          Stimulants.      Atomoxetine.      Antipsychotics.      Alternative Therapies in Developmental Disabilities  Some complementary and alternative therapies include:          Vitamin A      B-vitamins      Vitamin C      DMG (dimethylglycine)       Secretin      Dietary changes(gluten- and casein-free)        All of these are lacking solid evidence of efficacy.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/psychiatry/2015/04/28/intellectual-disability.html"},

Objective      To provide an overview of the assessment and diagnosis of mental health problems in children and adolescents.        The child pediatric assessment differs from adults in several ways:    Child psychiatry differs from adult psychiatry, in that disorders often consist of a lack of developmental progress, rather than the presence of specific symptoms.          In other words, it has less to do with a loss of function, but rather an impairment in gaining function.      Example → lack of social skills in autism.        Childhood brings many periods of transition, which can be a source of stress. These can often exacerbate or trigger mental illness.          Example → start of school leading to separation anxiety.      Depending on the developmental stage, many things can be normal:1. Aggression.2. Magical thinkingIf you didn’t teach your children not to fondle their genitals in public, they’d probably never stop!3. Public masturbation (!?!)4. Odd speech or dress5. Resistance to personal hygiene6. Strict adherence to rituals or routines.So it’s important to be know normal patterns of development to reassure patients that things are okay.  Comorbidity is the rule, not the exception.          50% of children with a mental illness will have a comorbidity.      This is because, in childhood, diseases can interfere with development in several areas.        How prevalent are mental health problems in children and teens?  By order of prevalence:          Anxiety Disorders.      Asthma      Learning disorders      Depression in adolescents.

Here we aim to get into the head of the patient, and describe what they’re experiencing.        In other words, (1) is more quantitative and clinical, and (2) is more qualitative and ‘touchy feely’ (the ‘art of medicine’).  We’ll be focusing on (2).  Objective      Describe the major components of the psychiatric mental status examination.  The Mental Status Examination  Mental Status Examination (MSE) → the psychiatry analog of the physical exam.          This is a separate part of your case presentation, just like the physical exam with other medical specialties.      However, it’s NOT a separate part of your interview.      In other words, you perform the mental status examination simultaneously to when you’re interviewing the patient.        What goes into the mental status examination?          An assessment of things like the patient’s appearance, mood, or affect.      Mnemonic for the components of the MSE → ABC STAMPLICKER.        ABC STAMPLICKER:          A → Appearance.      B → Behaviour.      C → Cooperation.      S → Speech.      T → Thought (Process &amp; Content).      A → Affect.      M → Mood.      P → Perceptual Abnormalities.      L → Level of Consciousness.      I → Insight &amp; Judgement.      C → Cognition.      K → Knowledge Base (and intelligence).      E → Endings (suicidal ideations, homocidal ideations).      R → Reliability (does their story seem reliable?)        Components of the MSE in detail:          Appearance → how is the patient groomed? Is he/she disheveled or smelly? Are they wearing outlandish clothing?      Behaviour → eg. is the patient agitated or withdrawn?      Cooperation → is the patient cooperating with you? Are they answering your questions?      Speech → is the patient speaking quickly? Slowly? Are they fluent? Are there any abnormalities in their speech?                  Think of this as the ‘pulse’ of the MSE; you should include the rate, rhythm, tone, and amplitude, just like when assessing a pulse!                    Thought:                  Thought process (or form) → how do they go from A → B?          Thought content → what are ‘A’ and ‘B’? What are they thinking about?                    Affect → is the patient laughing? Crying? Do they have a flat affect? This is an objective assessment.      Mood → the patient’s subjective experience of how they’re feeling.                   This is usually reflected in their affect, but they can sometimes be dissociated.          An example of an inappropriate affect (where the affect doesn’t match the mood) would be laughing while discussing a close friend’s death.                    Perceptual Abnormalities:                  Hallucinations → you perceive things without a pre-existing stimulus.                           All senses can be involved (auditory, visual, olfactory, somatosensory, gustatory).              Hallucinations can sometimes be normal (eg. in times of grief, or when you’re falling asleep).                                Illusions → you misperceive things with a pre-existing stimulus.                           This can be normal or abnormal (a normal example might be seeing a coat hanging on a rack in the dark, and mistaking it for a person).                                          Level of Consciousness → are they awake? alert? stuperous?      Insight &amp; Judgement:                  Insight → does the patient have insight as to their illness (do they know that there’s something wrong with them?)          Judgement → is the patient able to make good decisions?                    Cognition → not always done, but would involve the MoCA or MMSE.      Knowledge Base &amp; Intelligence:                  Knowledge → what you know.          Intelligence → what you do with what you know.                    Endings → both suicidal ideations, and homocidal ideations.                  Suicidal ideations can be passive or active, or ego syntonic or ego dystonic.          Ego syntonic → your suicidal ideations are in keeping with how you feel about yourself (eg. you feel worthless).          Ego dystonic → your suicidal ideations are not in keeping with how you feel about yourself (eg. patients who think ‘why am I thinking about this? I don’t feel upset in any way’).                    Reliability → does the patient’s story seem to be honest/reliable?        Components of the Mental Status Examination      ABC STAMPLICKER:              A → Appearance.        B → Behaviour.        C → Cooperation.        S → Speech.        T → Thought (Process &amp; Content).        A → Affect.        M → Mood.        P → Perceptual Abnormalities.        L → Level of Consciousness.        I → Insight &amp; Judgement.        C → Cognition.        K → Knowledge Base (and intelligence).        E → Endings (suicidal ideations, homocidal ideations).        R → Reliability (does their story seem reliable?)            Thought Form &amp; Content  Thought form &amp; content is one of the more important parts of the MSE. Some examples of what you’d look for in each are listed below.  Thought process (or form) → how do they go from A → B?          Direct/Goal Directed → they go logically from A → B.      Circumstantial → the patient goes off on a tangent, but then ends up returning to the right ‘endpoint’. For example, your nattering grandma that takes forever to get to the point.      Tangential → instead of going from A → B, they go off on a tangent, and they never come back (unlike a circumstantial thought process).      Derailing → they start off with a normal train of thought, but then it falls apart.      Flight of Ideas → the patient’s thought process keeps jumping to different ideas, but there’s still an understandable association.      Loosening of Associations → there’s no discernable association. It seems like the patient’s thought processes are completely at random.        Thought content → what are ‘A’ and ‘B’? What are they thinking about?           One example of abnormal thought content is with delusions.      Delusions → fixed false beliefs contrary to the social norms of the PATIENT (not the social norms of society).      Examples of delusions include:                  Jealousy → you think your s/o is cheating on you.          Grandiose → you think you have special powers.          Somatic → you think something’s wrong with your body when there isn’t.          Persecutory → when you believe that others are out to do you harm.          Erotomanic → when you believe that someone else is in love with you, and they’re not. Usually this is someone important or of a higher SES than you.          Nihilistic → illusions of nothingness; eg. that your head is ‘empty’.          Religious          Control → when you believe that you’re being controlled by someone/something else.          Reference → when you believe that things around you are referring to you, but they’re not. eg. when you watch TV and you think they’re speaking directly to you.                    Delusions can be classified as follows:                  Bizarre vs non-bizarre:                          Bizarre delusions could not happen in real world, while non-bizarre delusions could really happen in real world.              Bizarre example → martians implanting an electrode in your brain (bizarre)              Non-bizarre example → the belief that your s/o is cheating on you.                                Mood congruent vs mood incongruent vs mood neutral:                          Mood congruent delusions fit with the patient’s mood, while mood incongruent delusions do not with with the patient’s mood.              For instance, people during an episode of mania often have grandiose delusions (eg. I’m the king of England); this would be mood congruent.              But if the same manic patient thought that their phone was being bugged, this would be mood incongruent.                                          Thought Process Example  Which of the following is an example of Loose Associations:          “The sun bestrides the mouse doctor. In the morning, if you wish”      “Twenty-five dollars is a lot of money! Large faces and eyes”      “Cats dogs bikes tuna sandwich my name is fish fall down brown town gown”        3 is the right answer → you can see a vague connection between words, but things don’t make much sense.  Objective      Define and observe some common mental status findings.  Mental Status Findings  Catatonia           Not seen much anymore, since it’s typically asociated with very severe psychotic illnesses.      Characterized by waxy flexibility → you can move the patient’s body into any position, and they will just hold it there.      Most commonly associated with schizophrenia.        Delusional Misidentification → examples of this include:          Capgras Syndrome → as mentioned in neuro, this is where you recognize people, but you don’t feel an ‘air of familiarity’. Patients with this will believe that the ones close to them have been replaced by imposters.’      Syndrome of Intermetamorphosis → where you believe that another person is someone that they’re not. eg. “I know you don’t look anything like my mother, but you’re my mother”. The opposite of Capgras syndrome.      Fregoli Syndrome → where you believe that multiple different people are in fact a single person who changes appearances or is in disguise.      Syndrome of subjective doubles → where you believe that someone else is your double/doppelganger.         Cotard’s Syndrome          A rare syndrome where a patient holds the delusion that they’re dead, or that a body part of theirs is gone.      The key feature here is the delusion of negation → the patient will deny their existence, or the existence of a part of their body.      There can be a risk of self harm → if they think they’re dead, patients may arrange their own funeral/cremation.        Mania          Characteristic of Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness).      With an episode of mania, you see the following features:                  Pressure of speech → the patient is just so full of thought that they have to get it all out as quickly as he can, and they can’t have a normal flow of conversation. These patients will talk right over you.          Flight of ideas → as described above. A loss of any connection between ideas.          Flight of Ideas          Overfamiliarity/disinhibition          Delusions of grandeur          Decreased need for sleep                    Also often seen are delusions of reference (recall that this is when you believe that things around you are referring to you, but they’re not).      Mnemonic → DIGFAST:                  D → Distractability and easy frustration.          I → Irresponsibility and erratic uninhibited behaviour.          G → Grandiose delusions.          F → Flight of ideas          A → Activity increased (weight loss, increased libido concomitant)          S → Sleep decreased          T → Talkativeness.                      Features of Mania      DIGFAST mnemonic:              D → Distractability and easy frustration.        I → Irresponsibility and erratic uninhibited behaviour.        G → Grandiose delusions.        F → Flight of ideas        A → Activity increased (weight loss, increased libido concomitant)        S → Sleep decreased        T → Talkativeness.

All questions are related to a specific objective for the lecture which they are from.      If there were 2 lecturers for a single lecture, they have collaborated on the questions.      Questions will test application of knowledge and recall of information      Some Numbers on Mental Illness  There’s a great deal of stigma and ignorance surrounding mental illness and its treatment.          71% of Americans believe that mental illness is due to emotional weakness.      65% believe that it’s due to bad parenting.      45% believe it’s the victim’s fault, and that if they tried, they could will it away.      43% believe that mental illness is incurable.      35% believe that it’s a consequence of sinful behaviour.      Only 10% believe that mental illness has a biological basis involving the brain.        Only 20% of people with mental illness are ever diagnosed and treated.Introduction to Psychiatry  Fundamentally, psychiatry aims to treat disorders of the brain.  The brain has a number of functions, including:          Cognition      Behaviour      Emotions      Perception      Basic brain/body functions.      Each can be impaired.        Impairments of each of these correspond to different disease states:          Impaired Cognition → dementias, psychotic disorders, depression/bipolar, OCD, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, ADHD.      Impaired Behaviour → conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, ADHD, impulse control disorders.      Impaired Emotions → mood disorders, schizoaffective disorders, anxiety disorders.      Impaired Perception → somatoform disorders, psychotic disorders.      Impaired Basic Brain Functions → sleep disorders, eating disorders, sexual disorders.        The features and diagnostic criteria for these are listed in the DSM-5.          DSM-5 → Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.      The 5 Axes  5 axes → in DSM-4, we used to diagnose patients based on ‘5 axes’. The purpose of this is to understand a person as more than just their biologic illness.  The DSM-5 has largely gotten rid of this, but it’s still important to know because it’s still prevalent in practice.  These 5 axes are:          Axis 1 → clinical disorders, including major mental disorders, and learning disorders.      Axis 2 → personality disorders and intellectual disabilities.      Axis 3 → ‘medical’ conditions and physical disorders (aka. non-psychiatric illnesses).      Axis 4 → psychosocial and enviromental factors that are contributing to the disorder (eg. recent move, divorce, etc).      Axis 5 → Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).                  This is just a number (eg. 30-40/100), that’s used to express a person’s level of overall functioning (socially, occupationally, interpersonally, etc).           This is Incredibly subjective, and generally does not have much inter-rater reliability.          However, a GAF &lt; 40 usually means that the patient is unable to work.                      5 Axes (from DSM-4)      Axis 1 → clinical disorders, including major mental disorders, and learning disorders.    Axis 2 → personality disorders and intellectual disabilities.    Axis 3 → ‘medical’ conditions and physical disorders (aka. non-psychiatric illnesses).    Axis 4 → psychosocial and enviromental factors that are contributing to the disorder (eg. recent move, divorce, etc).    Axis 5 → Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), or Children’s Global Assessment Scale for those &lt; 18 y/o.    Example:          34 y/o man with a history of asthma, had 3 episodes of untriggered chest heaviness, shortness of breath, dizziness, extreme fear, and palpitations, following the death of his father.      He became so scared of these symptoms, that he began to avoid leaving his home and had to take a leave of absence from his job.      This meant a coworker would have to pick up his slack, which bothered him because he did not believe others could do the job in the exact way he knew it had to be done.        Corresponding 5 axes:          Axis 1 → panic disorder with agoraphobia.      Axis 2 → OCPD traits.      Axis 3 → asthma.      Axis 4 → recent death of father.      Axis 5 → GAF = 50-60.      Introduction to Psychopharmacology  This is designed as a very brief introduction, so as you hear about these medications during lectures, you’ll have some context.  There will be a more complete lecture on psychopharmacology at the end of the lecture series.  Do not get too hung up on medication names right now.           On the exam, they will try to give both the medication drug name and the trade name. Sometimes, they’ll even give the drug class.      Major Neurotransmitters  There are 5 major neurotransmitters:          Serotonin      Norepinephrine      Dopamine      GABA      Glutamate        Of these, the first 3 (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) are the monoamines.          Medications that increase levels of the monoamines are used to treat anxiety and depression.      Blocking dopamine in specific areas of the brain can also be used to treat psychosis.        GABA → the brain’s major inhibitory neurotransmitter.          Increasing the level of GABA (eg. with benzodiazepines) causes more brain inhibition, which can calm people down.      Hence, GABA-enhancers can be used to treat anxiety disorders.        Glutamate → the brain’s major excitatory neurotransmitter.           Decreasing the level of glutamate can similarly be calming.      Hence, glutamate-blockers can also be used to treat anxiety disorders.        Major Neurotransmitters in Psychopharmacology      There are 5 major neurotransmitters:              Serotonin        Norepinephrine        Dopamine        GABA        Glutamate              Monoamines → serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.    GABA → major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS.    Glutamate → major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS.  Mechanisms of Action  Reuptake Inihibitors            Presynaptic neurons have reuptake pumps that are used to take up neurotransmitters that have been fired into the synaptic cleft.      These are reuptake pumps specific for individual monoamines (eg. a serotonin reuptake pump, norepinephrine pump, etc.)      By blocking these reuptake pumps, the neurotransmitter won’t get retaken up into the presynaptic neuron, and will remain available.      This functions to increase the level of NT binding to the post-synaptic receptors.      Over time, this results in downregulation of post-synaptic receptors. It’s thought that this is what actually causes depression/anxiety to get better (which is also why these meds take a while to have an effect).      Example → SSRIs (selectively inhibits serotonin reuptake pumps).        Monamine Oxidase Inhibitors            Monoamine Oxidase → the enzyme that breaks down the monoamine neurotransmitters, and thus makes them unavailable to bind post-synaptic receptors.      MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors) block this enzyme, resulting in less monoamine degradation.      This also increases the amount of neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft, and has the same net effect as a reuptake inhibitor.        NOTE → Reuptake pump inhibition, and monoamine oxidase inhibition are the mechanism of action for most anti-depressive of anti-anxiety medications.  Key Mechanisms of Action      Reuptake Inhibitors → block the monoamine reuptake pumps to increase their levels at the synaptic cleft.    Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors → block the enzyme that breaks down monoamines to increase monoamine levels at the synaptic cleft.  Medication Groups  There are 4 major groups of medications you to know about (for starters):          Anti-depressants.      Anti-anxiety.      Anti-psychotics.      Mood-stabilizers.      1. Anti-depressants  Block Monoamine Reuptake:          SSRIs → Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors.      SNRIs → Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors.      NDRIs → Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor.      TCAs → Tricyclic Antidepressants.                  These are basically reuptake inhibitors as well, except they’re named after their structure, rather than their function.          However, they work in exactly the same way as SSRIs, SNRIs, etc.                      Block Monoamine Oxidase → phenelzine, tranylcypromine.  Others → these have different mechanisms of action as the 2 groups listed above, but they all still act on the monoamines.2. Anti-Anxiety  Serotonin Enhancers → these are the same medications used in depression (listed above): SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, etc.  GABA enhancers → these increase GABA inhibition, producing a calming effect. The classic example is Valium (Diazepam). These are also known as benzodiazepines!  Glutamate blockers → these reduce glutamate excitation, similarly producing a calming effect.          Examples: gabapentin, pregabalin.      These are aused in a variety of other situations as well (eg. neuropathic pain).      3. Anti-Psychotics  Anti-psychotics are also referred to as neuroleptics (an older name).          They’re used to treat psychotic illnesses.        Anti-psychotic medications can be broadly classified into 2 categories:          Old/Typical → anything before ~1985.      Novel/Atypical → anything after ~1985.        The older anti-psychotics are primarily blockers of the D2 dopamine receptors.  The newer anti-psychotics not only block the D2 dopamine receptors, but also do a few other things (which are thought to improve outcomes).4. Mood StabilizersNote that anti-depressants are NOT effective at treating mood disorders. In fact, giving a patient with bipolar disorder an anti-depressant can actually precipitate an episode of mania! This is why it’s important to always screen for a previous episode of mania in any patient with depression, to rule out bipolar disorder.  Mood stabilizers are used to treat patients with a fluctuant mood (eg. bipolar disorder).  Medications that are used as mood stabilizers include:          Anti-seizure medications → epilepsy medications are also used for bipolar disorders.      Antipsychotic Medications → the novel/atypical antipsychotic medications are also effective as mood stabilizers.      Others → Lithium.        Summary of Psychopharmacology Medication Groups      Anti-depressants:              Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs, NDRIs, TCAs).        Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors.        Others.              Anti-anxiety:              Anti-depressants (see 1).        GABA enhancers.        Glutamate blockers.              Anti-psychotics:              Old/Typical (before 1985).        Novel/Atypical (after 1985).              Mood Stabilizers:              Anti-seizure medications.        Novel/Atypical Anti-psychotic medications.        Lithium.
