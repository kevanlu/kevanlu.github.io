	{"title": "ENT Small Group Cases", "text": "Case #1A mother arrives at your clinic with her 6-year old daughter. The mother is concerned about a mass that is present on the anterior midline of the child&#8217;s neck. The mass has recently become painful and has recently increased in size.Additional InformationUpon physical examination the mass is 1.5cm. The mass is soft, round, red and tender to palpation. The patient experiences pain and difficulty swallowing.1. What more do you want to know on history? About the mass?The Peds history!Pregnancy, birth, NICU stays, developmental milestones, immunized, etc.How long has the mass been there, has it changed over time?2. What is the differential diagnosis for a child with a midline lump in the neck?Differential diagnosis of a central neck mass in a child includes (but is not limited to):Thyroglossal duct cystBrachial cleft cystMalignant tumorOf these, the most likely would be a thyroglossal duct cyst.A thyroglossal duct cyst is an embryologic cystic remnant.There is a persistent thyroglossal duct hanging from the foramen caecum (at the midline of the tongue on the sulcus terminalis).3. What simple physical examination test could be used to assist with your differential diagnosis?An easy way to determine if it&#8217;s a thyroglossal duct cyst is to get the patient to stick their tongue out.Since in this condition, the thyroid attaches to back of tongue, if it&#8217;s a cystic duct, then it should move up.4. Given the information above, which diagnosis is most likely?A thyroglossal duct cyst.5. Is the lump in this condition usually benign or malignant? If it is benign can it become malignant and if so under what circumstances?This is benign, not worrisome, not cancerous.However, a thyroglossal duct cyst can become malignant, if there are remnant thyroid cells that can form a cancer (cancer won&#8217;t occur in the cyst itself).So a thyroglossal duct carcinoma arises from ectopic thyroid tissue, and not the cyst itself.6. Are there any additional investigations you would like to perform?Ultrasound.Blood tests for thyroid function (TSH).A thyroid scan (nuclear medicine scan) is also done, but this is fairly rare.7. What is the most likely cause of the sudden onset in swelling, tenderness and redness of the mass?If the cyst is an embryological remnant, why did it suddenly get bigger?This was probably secondary to an infection &#8594; the cyst is lined by a mucous membrane. As your nose secretes mucous due to infection, so can the cyst!This mucous secretion causes swelling of the cyst.8. What is the most likely acute treatment option for this child?Antibiotics to deal with the infection!Draining the cyst is a bad idea &#8594; risk of continual drainage from the cyst.9. What is the long-term treatment option for this child?As an ENT, you can surgically excise the remnant tract emanating from the tongue.Sometimes this remnant duct can go behind the hyoid, and sometimes it can go in front of the hyoid.In cases where it goes behind the hyoid, we actually remove a portion of the bone &#8594; functionally, the hyoid is actually not too important, as long as the muscular attachments are still there.So often the mid portion of the hyoid bone and a small piece from the base of the tongue is removed, to reduce recurrence rates.This is called the Sistrunk procedure.Case #2A mother and 5-year old child present to your clinic. The child has been having a sore throat for a few days now and mom is quite concerned as this is the fourth episode in the last 6 months.1. What do you want to know on history?Peds history, history of the chief complaint.Pain &#8594; does it hurt? Unilateral, bilateral?Weight loss, appetite.How is their voice? Breathing?Review of Systems.Have they seen anyone else about it?2. What are you looking for on physical examination?ABCs and vitals always! Fever? Tachycardia? Any need to stabilize the patient?Look in the mouth! Do a head &#38; neck examination!Here we see purulent exudates on the tonsils (tonsilar exudates).Tonsil obstruction can be graded, from I to IV.Grade 1 &#8594; &#60; 25%.Grade 2 &#8594; 25-50%.Grade 3 &#8594; 50-75Grade 4 &#8594; 75-100 (kissing tonsils.)In this case, this would be about a grade 3.Oftentimes, tonsilar swelling can cause uvular deviation!With a tonsilar exudate, in our diagnostic work-up, we would also look somewhere else on the body:The abdomen/spleen &#8594; if it&#8217;s mono, then the spleen can be enlarged.This is important to check, because if the patient is physically active, they could be hit there and have spleen rupture!3. What is your differential diagnosis?The top 3 diseases on your differential would be:Infective Mononucleosis &#8594; viral.Strep Throat (Tonsilitis) &#8594; bacterial.Peritonsilar abcess (especially if there was uvular deviation).Peritonsilar abcess is lower on the differential since there&#8217;s no observed uvular deviation.To determine between viral and bacterial etiologies we use a swab &#8594; rapid strep test.4. Any further work-up / tests?Take a swab &#8594; rapid strep test! If it&#8217;s positive, you have strep.Could also do a monospot test if it was mono.Could do a CBC-D to determine if it&#8217;s an infection. Bacterial infections would have a marked increase in the white count, while viral infections would not.5. What is the likely etiology?Viral infections are significantly more common.Often patients will ask for antibiotics, which will do nothing if there is a viral etiology.Most common viruses are adenovirus, but also cocksackie, herpes simplex, etc.The most common bacteria would be Streptococci.6. What is your initial management?First you would do the swab to determine if it&#8217;s bacterial or not.Initial treatment is conservative &#8594; acetaminophen, ibuprofen if it&#8217;s viral.If it&#8217;s not viral, we use antibiotics.Easy to treat if it&#8217;s strep &#8594; penicillin!If they&#8217;re resistant to penicillin, you could use a conjugated penicillin, like amox/clav.7. When is tonsillectomy considered for tonsillitis?We&#8217;re now more picky when selecting patients for tonsillectomy due to recurrent infections.We use the Paradise criteria:The Paradise Criteria&geq; 7 infections per year.&geq; 5 infections per year for past 2 years.&geq; 3 infections per year for past 3 years.These infections must be culture positive for strep.8. Any other indications for tonsillectomy?Tonsillectomies are done more often now for Sleep ApneaYou would also perform one if you suspect it is a lymphoma or cancer.Patients will often present with one massive, ulcerated tonsil, and one normal one.9. What are the risks/possible complications of tonsillectomy?3-5% of patients with a tonsilectomy have a risk of bleeding, because of the tonsilar branches of the facial artery/vein.Also, behind the palatine tonsils are the superior constrictors, and behind those are the internal carotids.Tonsil &#8594; superior constrictor &#8594; internal carotid.So if you puncture the internal carotid (which feeds the brain), you&#8217;re in deep shit!Case #3A 70-year-old woman presents to your office with a complaint of a mass on the left side of her face. The patient has a history of skin cancer and tells you that she first noticed the mass a few months ago and it had increased in size since then. It had recently become more severe and now she has facial paralysis on her left side. Upon physical examination the mass is present at the angle of the left mandible, not well defined, extremely firm and mildly tender to palpation.1. What are the triangles of the neck? What are their borders? Which triangle contains the mass?Anterior triangle &#8594; anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, midline, mandible.Posterior triangle &#8594; posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, clavicle, anterior border of the trapezius.In this case, it would be in the anterior triangle, since the SCM attaches to the mastoid, behind the mass.2. What things are in your top differential diagnosis for this lateral neck mass?Malignancy:Since she had a skin cancer before, the most likely thing on your differential would be metastases to lymph nodes of the parotid.Could also be a parotid malignancy, since the parotid gland lives there.Could also be a lymphoma.3. What is the differential diagnosis for a parotid mass?Benign CausesCysts, infection, salivary stones.Pleomorphic Adenoma &#8594; most common benign tumour.Warthin&#8217;s tumour (seen in smokers, bilateral) &#8594; second most common benign tumour.Neoplastic CausesMucoepidermoid Carcinoma &#8594; Most common malignant parotid gland tumour.Adenocarcinoma &#8594; second most common malignant parotid gland tumour.LymphomasCould also get Mets to lymph nodes (eg. melanomal)Could also be a parotid infection.Could also be mumps if the patient isn&#8217;t immunized, or has lost their immunity.If the patient had bilateral parotid swelling, and titres showed reduced/no immunity, then this would definitely be on the differential!Could also get salivary stones causing backup of saliva (similar to kidney stones).Could also get parotid cysts.If a patient suddenly presents with numerous parotid cysts (lymphoepithelial cysts), which he/she never had before, then this is suggestive of HIV &#8594; Often one of the first signs of HIV!RememberThe most common benign parotid tumours are:Pleomorphic AdenomaWarthin&#8217;s TumourThe most common malignant parotid tumours are:Mucoepidermoid CarcinomaAdenocarcinomaSudden presentation of numerous parotid cysts (lymphoepithelial cysts), without any other obvious etiology, is suggestive of HIV!4. What is the next step in working up a parotid mass?Is it progressing?Is it causing pain? What are provoking systems?Does it swell when you eat (suggestive of a salivary stone, since you would produce saliva when you eat, which would get trapped).If skin cancer was on opposite cheek, then risk of metastases to the contralateral cheek is low.But if the previous cancer was on the same side, this makes metastases more likely.Would take a biopsy &#8594; don&#8217;t want to take a big biopsy with the facial nerve nearby, so you do a FNAB!Never do an open biopsy or a core biopsy if you don&#8217;t want to hurt the nerve!Would do imaging to determine the scope of the tumour/cyst!CT for basic anatomy.MRI possibly for soft tissue, especially if it seems to be proceeding to the brain.Since the patient had skin cancer in the area, the most likely differential is metastases to lymph nodes in the parotid gland.5. What is the most likely cause of the patients left facial paralysis?Impingement of the facial nerve beneath the parotid.6. Is this mass more likely malignant or benign? Why?Probably malignant.Benign masses that push on the facial nerve rarely cause facial nerve paralysis! It has to be very massive and very huge to cause this.Benign things grow and push.Malignant things can grow into things, which can cause the paralysis.So if there&#8217;s facial nerve paralysis, it&#8217;s suggestive of malignancy.RememberIf a parotid tumour results in facial nerve paralysis, it&#8217;s suggestive of malignancy7. Rank order the major salivary glands in order of greatest to least risk of containing a mass, and in descending risk of malignancy:Parotid &#8594; most growths, least likely to have malignant growth.SubmandibularSublingual &#8594; fewest growths, most likely to be malignant!So in summary, the glands with the most growths will be the least likely to be malignant!RememberGrowths are most seen in the parotid &#62; submandibular &#62; sublingual.However, malignant growths are most seen in reverse order: sublingual &#62; submandibular &#62; parotid.8. What treatment course would you suggest for this patient?A superficial parotidectomy would be performed, by an ENT:There is actually a superficial and deep lobe of parotid, separated by facial nerve.Since the tumour has already taken the facial nerve, you would take out the nerve too!Different options here, can take other nerves and try to cable graft the two ends of the nerve that have been resected.There&#8217;s a 50-50 chance of restoring some degree of function!Since this tumour is also diffuse, would also involve radiation.9. What is the most important thing to protect with a facial nerve injury?Most important function of the facial nerve is to protect the eye!Preventing of closure of the eyelids is an optho emergency!Risk of corneal dryness, abrasions, blindness!If this is transient Bell's palsy, you would give the patient eye drops, keep their eyes lubricated, or tape their eyes closed.If the palsy is permanent, you can actually put weights in the eyelid, to help it close with less stimulation.Case #4A 23 year old man is brought to the emergency room after being struck by a hockey puck in the face at a local rink. He also sustained a concussion as he fell to the ground and hit his head on the ice. You are the physician on-call and are given the case. The man has sustained trauma to his face with the front teeth being displaced back into the oral cavity. The patient is unconscious, breathing is labored and there is bleeding from deep cuts on his face.1. What is your initial plan of action? What are your top three concerns? How would you deal with them?Your top 3 concerns are always the ABCs!AirwaysTo protect airways, try head thrusts, chin tilts, a bag mask, intubation.Also consider an LMA &#8594; laryngeal mask airway.After these fail, you would try surgical airways.CricothyrotomyTracheotomyIf they&#8217;ve lost teeth, try to clear debris first.For facial trauma, don&#8217;t put anything near the nose for nasal intubation because of risk of cribriform damage.BreathingAre they breathing? Is their chest going up or down?Rib fractures, is breathing symmetric?Deviation of the trachea suggestive of atelectasis or pneumothorax.Auscultate, percuss the lungs.Oxygen saturation.CirculationIVs if they&#8217;re losing blood.Blood pressure, heart rate..RememberIf a patient has facial trauma, don&#8217;t nasally intubate because of the risk of cribriform damage.2. You adequately manage the first priorities; the patient begins to become unstable. SaO2 drops to 81%, You notice that the trachea is now to the left of midline, there are decreased breath sounds on the right side, and a very hollow percussion note. What is your diagnosis and management?Tension pneumothorax, air entering pleural space.Also pushes the trachea because the influx of air pushes against it.Since the patient is immediately tanking, don&#8217;t do an X-Ray, because it&#8217;s a waste of time!Clinical diagnosis, gotta let the air out quickly!Syringe in the midclavicular line, second intercostal space.For a more permanent chest tube, you&#8217;d use a mid to anterior axillary line, at the 5th intercostal space.The 5th intercostal is approximately at the nipple line, although you shouldn&#8217;t use this ballpark approximation in saggy old ladies!Also, remember that every rib has a neurovascular bundle underneath the rib, so go immediately above!RememberGo between the ribs from above, because the neurovascular bundle lies below the ribs.3. The patient is now stable, what is your next step?The D and E and ABCDE:Disability &#8594; check cervical spine function.Neurological testing.Scale of 15, under 8 requiring intubation.Exposure &#8594; do a head-to-toe physical exam.4. The patient appears stable. You&#8217;ve found all the injuries you can on physical examination, what is your next step?Imaging, to look for c-spine truama, fractures, etc.You can look for the halo sign for CSF leakage from the cribriform.Drop nasal fluid onto a tissue, and the blood should form a halo, since blood is more dense than CSF.5. The patient has a multiple fractures to the lower face. What functional considerations need to be made when considering repairing lower/mid facial fractures? How are lower/mid-face injuries repaired (generally)?Maxillomandibular Fixation (MMF) &#8594; wire their mouth shut so the patient can&#8217;t move their jaw.Open Reduction with Internal Fixation &#8594; open incision to set bones, plus internal screws/plates to guide healing.Also ensure you put the teeth in the right position beforehand too! Make sure they have the right occlusion before you start wiring.Case #5A 65-year-old woman presents to your clinic for her annual physical examination. Upon physical examination, palpation of her neck reveals a nodule on the right side of the thyroid. The nodule is firm, painless to palpation and feels approximately 2 cm in greatest diameter. History reveals that the woman worked 30 years in nuclear medicine where she was exposed to low levels of ionized radiation.1. Would you like to know anything else on history?Signs of hyperthyroidism.Signs of hypothyroidism.Familial history of Graves disease, thyroid cancer.Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia can also also cause congenital thyroid cancer.2. If you had a hard time feeling the thyroid, are there any maneuvers you could do to help?Palpate while swallowing.3. How common are thyroid nodules?Very common &#8594; at least 50% at 50, 60% at 60, 70% at 70, the majority of which in female.4. Is thyroid cancer more common in men or women?They&#8217;re more common in women than in men.5. What are the most common types of thyroid cancer?There are 4 types of thyroid cancer:Papillary &#8594; most common, around 80% of thyroid cancers.FollicularMedullaryAnaplastic &#8594; most deadly type of cancer period, uniformly dead within 6 months. When papillary/follicular have transformed all of a sudden. Grows by the hour!Can have lymphoma of the thyroid too!Types of Thyroid CancerPapillary &#8594; most common, around 80% of thyroid cancers.FollicularMedullaryAnaplastic &#8594; most deadly type of cancer, pretty much 100% mortality after 6 months.6. How would you further work-up this nodule? What investigations would you order to determine whether the nodule is malignant?Similar with a parotid tumour.FNAB because there&#8217;s lots of other stuff near the thyroid.Imaging &#8594; ultrasound.TSH for thyroid problems.If the TSH is low, then the nodule is called hot/productive nodule.The thyroid is working very hard, so the body doesn&#8217;t have to stimulate it.Very rarely malignant.If their TSH is normal or high, then this is called a cold noduleEven though the thyroid is enlarged, it really isn&#8217;t doing anything, so this is more suggestive of malignancy.7. What is significant about the patient&#8217;s occupational history?Radiation exposure!Two biggest risk factors is family history and radiation exposure.8. The patient is diagnosed with a thyroid cancer and undergoes a total thyroidectomy. In the recovery room, you are called to the bedside because the patient is becoming acutely short of breath, and it appears that her neck is starting to swell! What do you do?Since it&#8217;s happening fast, it&#8217;s probably blood &#8594; bleed into the neck.This is a thyroid hematoma &#8594; you gotta drain that shit to secure the airway!This pressure causes venous congestion from the brain, causing further swelling, further closing airway. This makes it hard/impossible to intubate.The person will die within 5 minutes, unless someone opens up the neck to drain the blood, and then operate on them.9. The patient does well following your astute management but presents to your clinic several weeks later sounding very hoarse. She asks you what could have gone wrong?Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Recall, it supplies all muscles of larynx except for the cricothyroid (external laryngeal).If one is damaged, you have hoarseness because the vocal cords don&#8217;t completely touch in the middle. Also risk for aspiration, pneumonia, breathing problems.If there&#8217;s bilateral damage, then both vocal cords will be stuck in the middle &#8594; no airway! Acute stridor! Could require a tracheotomy for life.You can use a botox injection to the PCA, or surgical adjustment of the vocal cord, to bring them closer together, with unilateral damage to the recurrent laryngeal.Case #6A 47-year-old man presents to your office with nasal congestion and decreased sense of smell. He complains of persistent stuffiness, purulent drainage from the nose, dull headaches, and snoring. History reveals that the man has had asthma since he was a child and a history of alcohol intolerance.1. Would you like to know anything further on history?Feeling of clogged sinus, pain around maxilla, eyes.Facial pain, pressure, rhinorrhea, post-nasal drip (pus at back).Duration of anosmia. Possible preceding facial trauma causing damage to cribriform.Severe headaches, neurological issues, other signs of possible spread to brain.Allergies may set off issues to the nose, so they should also be asked about.2. On further inquiry, you find that in addition to having asthma, he is also allergic to Aspirin. Is this significant?Yes, it&#8217;s related to nasal polyps and asthma.This is known as Samter&#8217;s Triad:Nasal PolypsAsthmaAllergy to ASA/NSAIDsWe don&#8217;t know why this happens, but we suspect it&#8217;s a problem in the arachidonic acid pathway, resulting in abnormal production of leukotrienes.Samter&#8217;s TriadNasal PolypsAsthmaAllergy to ASA/NSAIDs3. On further inquiry, you discover that the patient has been using a nasal decongestant (Otrivin) on a regular basis to help with his symptoms for the past few weeks. Is this significant?Decreases the number of receptors &#8594; the nose becomes dependent on the vasoconstrictor.This is known as Rhinitis Medicamentosa.Typically, you try getting the patient to switch to a nasal corticosteroid spray, but they take weeks to months to work.Instead, let the patient use the vasoconstrictor on one side of the nose, so they can breathe through one nostril.As the other nostril adapts over time, let them breathe through the other side.4. The patient indicates that he has tried using nasal corticosteroids in the past but they didn&#8217;t work as well as his decongestant. Why is this?As said before, it takes weeks to months to work.5. What is your differential diagnosis for this patient&#8217;s nasal congestion?Cold. Viral upper respiratory tract infection.Sinusitis.Fungal infection of the nose.Tumour/growth &#8594; nasal polyps, cancer.Severe allergy causing inflammation.Juvenile Nasopharygeal Angiofibroma (JNA) &#8594; unilateral nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Only happens in males, early 20s, late teens. These are benign, but grow fast!6. You examine the nose and see some purulence draining from under the middle turbinate? What are most common bacteria that may be causing this purulent drainage?Streptococci pneumoniaeHaemophilus influenzaeMoraxella catarrhalisThis is basically the same for everything in the head and neck!They&#8217;re the 3 most common bacteria for:Otitis Media.Acute Sinusitis.Pneumonia.All of these are also sensitive to penicillin.3 Most Common Bacteria in ENTStreptococci pneumoniaeHaemophilus influenzaeMoraxella catarrhalis7. What further investigations would you perform in working up this patient?Scope the patient.CT Scan their sinuses.Allergy testing.8. Based on your full assessment and imaging, you determine that the patient has sinusitis. What are some possible complications of sinusitis?Local ComplicationsAsthma flare-ups.Mucous cysts, fungal mycetomas that fill up the sinuses.Can cause local pressure on bone, expanding bone.Complications due to SpreadMeningitis.Sinus infection of the ethmoid can get to eye, and cause vision problems.Periorbital abcess or orbital abcess &#8594; more common in children than adults.These can result in a lack of full mobility to the eye &#8594;inflammation of medial rectus prevents the eye from moving medially.Thrombosis of blood vessels in the head.9. What is your initial treatment plan?Viral etiologies are almost always more common than bacterial ones.Bacterial ones will typically last longer than 7 days, will have a higher fever, and will be less responsive to conservative treatment.Initially, you would start with conservative treatment: nasal decongestants (less than 3 days to avoid dependence), analgesics, etc.If the patient is still not improving after a week, start with antibiotics &#8594; penicillin &#8594; amoxicillin &#8594; amox/clav.Macrolides are second line &#8594; azithromycin, clarithromycin.10. Is there a surgical treatment option if the initial plan doesn&#8217;t work?Yes &#8594; endoscopic drainage of the sinuses!Wouldn&#8217;t do this for one episode, but you would do it in someone with Samter&#8217;s with repeated nasal polyps!If they had polyps, you can use a micro-debrider to suck up the polyps.This is known as functional endoscopic sinus surgery.There are risks because you&#8217;re working in a small space with delicate anatomy.There is risk of vision loss, since the optic nerve is on the other side of the sphenoid sinus.Also a risk of getting to the brain, causing a CSF leak.Finally, alongside the optic nerve is the internal carotid, so puncturing the sphenoid sinus can also cause bleeding.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/04/04/ent-small-groups.html"},

For instance:Holes.Immunosuppression.Numbers and virulence of bugs.Early on, aerobic strep.Later on, microenvironment change, change in acidity, development of anaerobic organisms, that cause foul smelling breath, etc.Host response to what the bacteria is doing, will cause disease. host response: fever, white count local response: swelling, trismus organisms: evolution cellulitis vs. abscessiiee anatomical spreadCellulitis = generalized aerobic streptococcal.Abcess is a space occupying lesion, more mature form of the infection.Aerobic streptococci can elaborate enzymes, hyaluronidases, collagenases, which break down fascial planes, allowing for deeper proliferation.Infection, started in tooth to brain, lungs, mediastinum, eyeball, etc.So organisms can spread to some exotic areas!Patient presents at a particular moment in a movie.Early, cellulitisMiddle, abcess.Late, abcess spread to brain, etc.You gotta know where they are, and anticipate where they are going to go!Anticipation &#38; Reaction &#8594; Action &#38; Re-evaluation, etc.You really better follow em up.Diagnosis: PRIMARY CAUSE = PORTAL OF ENTRY.The tooth sits inside the bone, surrounded by gum.Dentin and enamel. The enamel is the part you can see, it&#8217;s the icing. The cake itself is the dentin. Then there&#8217;s a tiny bit of shit inside, which is the icing inside the cake. This is the pulp, the artery, nerve, and the vein.Tooth, peridontal ligament, bone.Gingiva, like a turtle-neck sweater.bacteria get into tooth, secrete acid, melt their way into the inside of the tooth and invade the dentin.Dentin is less calcified than the enamel, dissolves more rapidly.When it gets to the pulp, then it can spread to other locations.This is PULPAL ENTRY.PERIODONTAL ENTRY.When you get a little bit older, there tends to be an increase in the depth of the neck of the turtleneck.Once can acquire periodontal foci.Melting of blah&#8230;PERICORONAL ENTRY.Partially erupted wisdom teeth, get stuff stuck around.Foci of infection.Pericoronal eg.Canonical example, impacted wisdom teeth.Flappy region above wisdom tooth = operculum.POST-TRAUMATIC.eg. major facial trauma, invasion of oral cavity material due to holes.Pretty serious with comorbidities.eg. post tooth extraction.Primary cause&#8230;portal of entry - THE 4 P&#8217;s a. pulpal b. periodontal c. pericoronal d. post-traumaticExtent &#8230; spread a. primary &#8230; source b. secondary &#8230; periapex c. tertiary &#8230; tissue spaces d. quaternary &#8230; tissue spacesHuge carious lesion of the tooth.

	{"title": "Pediatric Airway &amp; Stridor", "text": "Lecture OutlineAnatomy of LarynxPediatric vs Adult AnatomyDefinition of StridorEvaluation and Management of Stridulous PatientNeonatal StridorPediatric StridorAnatomy of the LarynxThe larynx is split into the supraglottis, glottis, to the subglottis.Supraglottis = above vocal folds.Glottis = at vocal folds.Subglottis = below vocal folds, to the cricoid cartilage.The larynx has a few functions, as seen before:Phonation &#8594; vocal cord approximation makes sound.Respiration &#8594; vocal cords have to open for air to get through.Airway Protection &#8594; the epiglottis has to close to protect the airways!Pediatric vs Adult Anatomy of the LarynxThe pediatric airway differs from an adult airway until 8-9.Some differences are as follows:1. The Position of the EpiglottisIn an infant, the end of the soft palate actually touches the epiglottis.Physiologically, why does this happen?When a baby breast-feeds, they have to be able to drink and breathe at the same time!Babies are obligate nasal breathers &#8594; they can only breathe through their nose.With this arrangement, as food goes through the mouth, the epiglottis can actually funnel food laterally past the airway.This allows the baby to keep their airway open while food is going down, without it going into the wrong pipe!Clinically, this makes it difficult to see the back of a throat of a baby &#8594; all you&#8217;ll see is their soft palate.2. The Position of the LarynxRelative to the cervical spine, the larynx is higher up.The cricoid is around C3-C4, versus C4-C5 in an adult.This has a physiological purpose as well &#8594; a protective one.Babies have an oversized mandible, so by having their larynx high up, the baby can protect their airways.This gives a defenseless baby some degree of protection from trauma.3. The Accordion EffectIn a baby, all the cartilages overlap &#8594; like an accordion!So the membranes that run between the cartilages, like the thyrohyoid membrane, or the cricothyroid membrane, will be obscured.Clinically, this means that you can&#8217;t do a cricothyrotomy in an infant!You also can&#8217;t really do a tracheotomy, because it&#8217;s difficult to determine where to make the incision.The cartilages of an infant are also much more compliant &#8594; so even when you palpate their airway, you can&#8217;t really feel where you are!Even worse, the trachea in an infant is sort of the same shape and size are the carotid artery.This means that you could accidentally nick the carotid &#8594; which has happened before!RememberCricothyrotomies and tracheotomies are relatively contraindicated in pediatric patients.4. Relative Sizes of the Vocal CordsThe back of the vocal cords is used for breathing.The front of the vocal cords is used for phonation.In an infant, the back of the vocal cords is similarly sized, but the front is much shorter.This is suggestive of function:A baby has less of a requirement to phonate, but still needs to breathe!Hence its anatomy associated with phonation is less developed.5. The Shape of the AirwayIn an adult, the airway is cylindrical.In a child, the airway is a cone &#8594; it&#8217;s very narrow at the subglottis.This means that children are more susceptible to airway obstruction at the subglottis.6. The Width of the SubglottisAs mentioned before, the subglottis is extremely narrow in infants.This means that something like subglottic edema would obscure a larger percentage of the airway.So subglottic edema can be extremely obstructive in infants!StridorStridor is noise produced by turbulent flow through a narrowed airway. Location-wise, this is at the larynx or below.Stertor is a snoring noise made by naso- and oropharyngeal obstruction.RememberStridor = larynx and down.Stertor = pharynx.Depending on the location of the obstruction, stridor can be:InspiratoryExpiratoryBiphasicThis means that we can often localize an obstruction by the nature of the stridor!Inspiratory StridorThese are seen with supraglottic lesions, above the vocal cords.On inspiration, the supraglottic region will tend to collapse inwards, narrowing the airway, increasing resistance.This causes turbulent flow with inspiration, resulting in inspiratory stridor.Expiratory StridorThese are seen with intrathoracic tracheal lesions, in the chest.This is because the airway can change shape with respect to the intrathoracic pressure.When there is negative pressure outside the intrathoracic airways, this will cause it to expand, reducing the relative size of obstruction.Therefore, obstruction will decrease on inspiration.However, on expiration, the opposite will occur, where positive intrathoracic pressure collapses the airways, increasing obstruction.As a result, an intrathoracic tracheal lesion will cause expiratory stridor.Aside: You can think of obstructive lung diseases as stridor in the lower lungs! So wheezing is effectively expiratory stridor.Biphasic StridorWe saw that there wasInspiratory stridor above the glottis.Expiratory stridor in the intrathoracic trachea.What about in the middle, ie. at the cricoid. (subglottis)The cricoid is firm &#8594; it doesn&#8217;t change in shape.This means that the degree of obstruction will depend on the flow of air.When you breathe in, you generally breathe faster, so you will see inspiratory stridor.As the obstruction worsens, it&#8217;ll cause biphasic stridor.Presentation of StridorInspiratory Stridor will be seen with a supraglottic lesion.Expiratory Stridor will be seen with a intrathoracic lesion.Biphasic Stridor will be seen with a severe subglottic lesion.Evaluation of StridorStridor is a sign, not a diagnosis &#8594; look for the cause.Stridor may be from congenital or acquired lesions &#8594; differentiate between these from the history and physical exam.HistoryAge of Onset:Congenital lesions will present in the first few weeks of life.Foreign body aspiration usually happens after 6 months.Croup (inflammation of larynx/trachea) &#8594; 6 months - 3 years.Onset and Precipitants:Toddler with sudden onset is sugggestive of a foreign body.Stridor, fever, hoarseness, and signs of infection &#8594; infection.Chronic/recurrent episodes &#8594; some pathologic process.Feeding and Growth:If a baby is having trouble breathing, it often affects their eating as well.So infants with airway obstruction will often fail to thrive, and fall off their growth curve.Obstetric &#38; Perinatal Hx:Was the baby premature?Intubation? Surgery?Physical ExamIndrawing:In younger babies, you&#8217;ll see subcostal indrawing (below the ribs).In older children, with less baby fat, you&#8217;ll also see intercostal indrawing.You&#8217;ll also see tracheal tugging &#8594; movement of the trachea at the sternal notch.Birth Marks &#8594; could be suggestive of hemangiomas in the airway.Craniofacial Anomalies &#8594; structural abnormalities that could predispose to stridor.Diagnostic TestingImaging isn&#8217;t too useful, unless you&#8217;re worried it&#8217;s a lower airway problem like pneumonia.However, you can use a nasopharyngoscope to examine the airway.Dynamic Examination &#8594; the patient can breathe, and phonate, and participate in the examination.Can only assess a patient down to the vocal cords, because you don&#8217;t want to induce a laryngospasm trying to past the cords.Rigid laryngoscopy &#38; bronchoscopy:Static Examination &#8594; the patient is sedated, and cannot contribute.Can be used if you need to examine the patient below the vocal cords, or if you need to manipulate/remove something.Because the nasopharyngoscope and rigid laryngoscopy &#38; bronchoscopy occupy different niches, they&#8217;re usually complementary to one another.Management of StridorWhen do you intervene?Reduced level of consciousness.If they&#8217;re hooked to a CO2 monitor, you should also intervene if they have hypercapnia.Apnea.What should you do? In order of what you should try:Bag &#38; Mask.Oral Airways &#8594; a little plastic insert that goes into the mouth or nose, and past the tongue. This keeps the tongue out of the airway.Intubation.Tracheotomy &#8594; if all else fails.As we said before, emergency tracheotomies are relatively contraindicated in children.To minimize risks, you actually insert a bronchoscope into the trachea to act as a support when you&#8217;re performing the tracheotomy.Neonatal StridorNeonatal Stridor (1-2 months old) can be caused by:LaryngomalaciaVocal Cord ParalysisSubglottic stenosisLaryngeal CystsLaryngeal websTracheal anomalies1. LaryngomalaciaThe most common congenital laryngeal abnormality.It&#8217;s also the most frequent cause of stridor in the neonate.Laryngomalacia &#8594; a softness of the cartilage of the larynx.Histologically, the cartilage is actually normal.We suspect that this &#8216;softness&#8217; is actually poor neuromuscular control of the larynx in infants, resulting in airway collapse.This results in collapse of supraglottic structures with inspiration &#8594; stridor.Signs &#38; SymptomsSince it&#8217;s a supraglottic problem &#8594; inspiratory stridor.Will be the worst at 6 months of age, but will improve as the baby matures.Generally does not cause a failure to thrive.CausesLaryngomalacia can be caused by:Collapse of the arytenoid mucosa.Shortened aryepiglottic folds.The epiglottis itself falling into the airway.Treatment90% resolve naturally, 10% don&#8217;t.If it doesn&#8217;t resolve, they may have a failure to thrive, life-threatening complications.One example would be cor pulmonale due to hypoxic vasoconstriction..So in these patients, you would treat them with a supraglottoplasty.2. Vocal Cord ParalysisThe second most common cause of stridor in the neonate.It can be unilateral or bilateral, both of which can cause stridor.Unilateral ParalysisWill have a breathy voice because they&#8217;ll be unable to approximate their vocal cords.With time, the other cord will try to compensate.This is usually due to nerve damage to the RLN.As mentioned before, the left side is more often involved because of the longer path of the left recurrent laryngeal.Bilateral ParalysisSymptoms depend on the point at which the cords are paralyzed.If the vocal cords can&#8217;t open, then you&#8217;ll have problems breathing.If the vocal cords can&#8217;t close, then you&#8217;ll have problems phonating, or protecting your airways.With bilateral paralysis, suspect CNS problems.One example is an Arnold-Chiari malformation, where the posterior fossa is too narrow, causing pressure on the base of the skull.TreatmentUnilateral Paralysis &#8594; The contralateral vocal cord can often compensate, so these often don&#8217;t require intervention.Bilateral Paralysis &#8594; Risk of airway obstruction if the vocal cords can&#8217;t open &#8594; 50% require a tracheotomy.3. Subglottic StenosisThe third most common cause of stridor in the neonate.Subglottis Stenosis &#8594; where the subglottic lumen is narrowed (&#60; 4 mm, where the normal range is 4.5 - 5.5 mm).5% is congenital.95% is acquired &#8594; typically due to intubation.So subglottic stenosis is primarily an iatrogenic consequence of intubation, which is often required in premature neonates.Pathophysiology for Acquired SGSThe endotracheal tube puts pressure on the tissue, causing ischemia.This causes edema, and mucosal ulceration.A secondary infection occurs, and the immune response results in scarring and stenosis.TreatmentIf it&#8217;s mild, just observe! Often a child will grow out of it.If it&#8217;s severe, it may require surgical treatment:Tracheotomy to maintain the airway.Surgical resolution of the stenosis (many procedures).RememberThe 3 most common causes of neonatal stridor are:Laryngomalacia.Vocal Cord Paralysis.Subglottic Stenosis.Pediatric StridorPediatric Stridor can be caused by:CroupEpiglottitisSubglottic HemangiomaAirway Foreign BodySublgottic cystRecurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis1. CroupCroup &#8594; aka. Laryngotracheobronchitis.It&#8217;s a viral infection of the airway, leading to subglottic narrowing.Since this is a subglottic lesion, there will be inspiratory stridor, unless it&#8217;s severe (in which case it&#8217;ll be biphasic stridor).Most common cause of pediatric stridor.Viral etiology:Mainly caused by Parainfluenza, also RSV, influena.Other viruses.This will usually resolve once the infection gets better and the inflammation subsides. Treatment is supportive, although steroids can be used to deal with the inflammation.If you look at the vocal cords with croup, you'll notice that the folds of the vocal cord are actually to the side, and that the part that meets in the middle is actually a swelling! This results in severe airway obstructionThe Steeple SignSteeple Sign &#8594; you&#8217;ll see that the shape of the trachea forms a &#8216;steeple.&#8217;Because of the subglottic narrowing, you see an inverted v shape formed by the trachea.This is supportive of a diagnosis of croup.RememberA steeple sign supports the diagnosis of croup.2. EpiglottitisEpiglottitis &#8594; aka. Supraglottitis.Used to be more common, but now it&#8217;s rare because of H. influenzae vaccinations. Always ask about vaccinations on Hx!Due to bacterial infection.As mentioned before, used to be mainly Haemophilus influenzae.Now it&#8217;s mostly Group A Strep (Strep. pyogenes).Signs &#38; SymptomsRapid onset, unlike croup, where there&#8217;ll be a slower onset.Will present with a high fever, respiratory distress, etc.The image on the right is one of epiglottitis &rarr; it's very severe!TreatmentThis needs to be operatated on &#8594; laryngoscopy and intubation in the OR.IV antibiotics should be used.RememberCroup is a viral infection leading to subglottic obstruction. It has a slow onset.Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection leading to a supraglottic obstruction. It has a rapid onset.3. Subglottic HemangiomaMost common tumour of infancy, and the most common head &#38; neck tumour in children.Associated with birth marks, as mentioned before.Treatment:Steroids, beta-blockers are conservative treatment.Surgery is used if that fails.4. Foreign Body AspirationThis can be anywhere from the vocal cords to the bronchi.These usually require retrieval in the OR.Natural history:Choking/coughing/gagging &#8594; if caught at this point, easy to treat.Asymptomatic interval &#8594; if the aspiration was not seen, often it will not be detected during this time. The asymptomatic interval is because the child has exhausted their cough reflex.Complications &#8594; cough, hemoptysis, pneumonia, lung abcess, fever, malaise.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/31/pediatric-airway-stridor.html"},

	{"title": "The Thyroid", "text": "Lecture OutlineIntroduction.Thyroid anatomy &#38; function.Recent trends and demographics.Etiology &#38; epidemiology of Thyroid Cancer.Classification of Thyroid Cancer.Thyroid Surgery.Work-up of the thyroid nodule.Diagnosis &#38; Management of Thyroid Cancer.Review of American Thyroid Association Guidelines Taskforce.Interactive Thyroid Cases.IntroductionThyroid AnatomyThe thyroid gland sits on top of the trachea, right below the cricoid cartilage.It&#8217;s butterfly shaped, with an isthmus crossing over the trachea.The vascular supply comes in laterally into the thyroid.Arteries &#8594; superior and inferior thyroid artery.Veins &#8594; superior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins.The thyroid sits adjacent to the carotid sheath, which is why thyroid cancer can often involve the structures in it.The parathyroid glands sit on the back of the thyroid gland.The recurrent laryngeal nerve travels behind the thyroid gland.The left RLN loops around the arch of the aorta.The right RLN loops around the right subclavian artery.Thyroid FunctionThe thyroid is an endocrine gland.It only produces two things:Thyroid Hormone.Calcitonin.The majority of the cells in the thyroid are follicular cells, which secrete thyroglobulin.This thyroglobulin is converted to thyroid hormone in the colloid.Parafollicular cells (clear cells) which are adjacent to the follicular cells, are of a different embryological origin from the follicular cells, and secrete calcitonin.RememberFollicular Cells &#8594; secrete thyroglobulin.Colloid &#8594; converts thyroglobulin to thyroid hormone.Parafollicular Cells (clear cells) &#8594; secrete calcitonin.Thyroid Hormone PhysiologyLike most endocrine organs, there&#8217;s a negative feedback loop involving the hypothalamus:The hypothalamus produces TRH &#8594; Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone.TRH stimulates the pituitary to produce TSH.TSH stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones &#8594; namely T3 &#38; T4.T3 &#38; T4 inhibit TRH and TSH release from the hypothalamus and pituitary.T3 is the most active form of thyroid hormone.However, the thyroid produces T4 &#62;&#62; T3.T4 is converted to T3 in the periphery.T3 has a short half life &#8594; 1 day.T4 has a longer half life &#8594; 7-10 days.It makes sense that the more active component would have the shorter half-life!Thyroxine = T4.Cytomel = T3.T4 is usually what&#8217;s given in patients with hypothyroidism, or post-surgery, simply because its systemic absorption is more predictable.RememberT4 = Thyroxine. Longer half life, converted to T3 in the periphery.T3 = Cytomel. Shorter half life.The thyroid produces T4 &#62;&#62; T3.Recent Trends and DemographicsThyroid nodules are extremely common.30-60% population will have nodules on thyroid ultrasound.4% of the general population have clinically palpable nodules.More common in females.However, thyroid malignancy is not common.Only 10-15% of clinically palpable nodules will harbour malignancy.The vast majority of subclinical nodules will never become clinically significant.Etiology of Thyroid CancerThe vast majority of thyroid nodules are sporadic, with no preceding risk factors.Risk Factors include:Radiation Exposure &#8594; following irradiation, up to 40% of patients develop nodules. Of these, 30% are malignant.Pre-Existing Thyroid Disease.Genetic Factors &#8594; examples include:Gardner&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; germline APC mutation which causes congenital adenomas of the colon.Cowden&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; germline mutation in the P10 tumour supressor gene causing diffuse hamartomas.Family Hx of thyroid cancer &#8594; 1st degree relative.Epidemiology of Thyroid CancerPretty rare &#8594; 0.5-1.0% of all Cancers.Incidence &#8594; 25/million/year.1100 deaths/year in the USA.100 deaths/year in Canada.Deaths are almost all due to the more aggressive thyroid cancers like anaplastic subtype. The well differentiated ones have a fairly good prognosis.The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased in recent years &#8594; is this due to better screening or increased exposures?Judging from epidemiological studies, this is probably due to increases in screening.Note that the majority of the increase is ascribed to papillary cancer, which is the most indolent, and often wouldn&#8217;t present clinical signs.The cancers with more obvious clinical presentations (such as the poorly differentiated thyroid cancers), have stayed stable in incidence.This is reflected in the fact that the mortality rate has not changed even with the increase in mortality.This suggests an improvement in detecting the subtle nodules, which we would have otherwise missed in the past.This suggests that we should avoid signing patients up for unnecessary tests &#8594; the risk will often exceed the benefit if it&#8217;s a node that doesn&#8217;t present clinical signs.RememberThe increased incidence of thyroid cancer is probably due to earlier detection (perhaps unnecessarily) rather than a systemic cause.Classification of Thyroid CancerThyroid Cancer can be classified into:Epithelial Thyroid Cancer.Non-epithelial Thyroid Cancer.Epithelial Thyroid CancerNon-epithelial Thyroid CancerPapillary (most common)LymphomaFollicular (second-most common)SarcomaPoorly-differentiatedOthers (metastases, eg)MedullaryAnaplastic (most deadly)OthersOf the epithelial thyroid cancers, papillary/follicular cancers are relatively indolent. They often take years/decades to present problems.In contrast, anaplastic thyroid cancer is probably the most deadly cancer there is &#8594; with a median survival time of around 2 months!Frequency of Thyroid Cancers:In order from most common to least common:Papillary Carcinoma (55-65%)Follicular Carcinoma (20-30%)Medullary Carcinoma (3-8%)Anaplastic Carcinoma (&#60;5%)Papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas are the well differentiated thyroid cancers &#8594; WDTC.Papillary carcinomas have some high risk variants that are more aggressive &#8594; eg. tall cell, columnar, diffuse, sclerosing.RememberIn order from most common to least common:Papillary Carcinoma (55-65%)Follicular Carcinoma (20-30%)Medullary Carcinoma (3-8%)Anaplastic Carcinoma (&#60;5%)Papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas are well differentiated thyroid cancers &#8594; WDTC.Staging of WDTCsUses the TMN staging system we&#8217;ve seen before.The classification schema is shown below:Thyroid SurgeryThere are 3 indications for thyroid surgery:Rule out/treat malignancy.Compressive symptoms &#8594; this usually only occurs with an extremely large thyroid. One example is seen to the right &#8594; you can actually see compression of the trachea due to a large thyroid mass!Hyperfunctional nodule/gland &#8594; which is refractory to medical management.Surgical Options include:Open Biopsy.Lobectomy, &#8216;hemi-thyroidectomy&#8217; &#8594; taking out half the thyroid.Subtotal Thyroidectomy &#8594; rarely done. We usually either take out half (hemi-thyroidectomy), or take it all out (total thyroidectomy).Total Thyroidectomy &#8594; taking out the entire thyroid.If the patient has thyroid cancer, depending on if/where it has spread, you may also need to do a:Central Neck Dissection.Lateral Neck Dissection.Sternal Split.Indications for Thyroid SurgeryRule out/treat malignancy.Compressive symptoms.Hyperfunctional nodule/gland refractory to medical Tx.Work-up of the Thyroid NoduleHistoryYou&#8217;re considered a high risk patient if you have had:Head and neck irradiation.Chernobyl under 14 years of age.First degree relative w/ thyroid malignancy.Rapid growth.RememberPertinent signs on Hx for high risk include:Head and neck irradiation.Chernobyl under 14 years of age.First degree relative w/ thyroid malignancy.Rapid growth.Physical ExaminationBreathy voice &#8594; possible involvement of the RLN.Cervical lymphadenopathy.Fixed nodule.Work-up AlgorithmThe algorithm is complicated, but focus on a few salient points:BloodworkWhat bloodwork should you do with a thyroid nodule work-up?TSH &#8594; yes!Thyroglobulin &#8594; no!Recall that thyroglobulin is produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid, and it&#8217;s converted into thyroid hormone in the colloid.Studies have shown that thyroglobulin levels have no correlation with the actual risk of malignancy.Calcitonin &#8594; maybe! - This is ultraspecific for medullary cancers, but it&#8217;s controversial whether this should be regularly measured, since medullary cancers are so rare.RememberTSH should be measured when working up a thyroid nodule.Calcitonin is only useful for medullary thyroid cancers.Low TSHA low TSH is important because a small subset of thyroid nodules will be hyperactive.A hyperactive thyroid will produce excess thyroid hormone which inhibits TSH production.In this case, what&#8217;s recommended is a thyroid scan (radiation uptake scan &#8594; an iodine scan or a technetium scan).Low TSH is the only indication for a radiation uptake scan.If you do find a hyperfunctioning nodule (also known as a hot nodule), then the chances of it being cancer is low.In these cases, medical treatment should be done first, and surgical treatment should only be considered if it&#8217;s refractory to treatment.The Radiation Uptake ScanDepending on the pattern of radiation, you can determine whether you have a hyper-functioning nodule, or the entire gland is over-active.Hyper-functioning Nodule &#8594; you&#8217;ll see a localized high uptake. This would be a hot nodule.Entire Gland &#8594; if the entire gland is over-active, then you&#8217;ll see diffuse high-uptake. One possible cause is Grave&#8217;s Disease.Again, recall that a hot nodule is less likely to be malignant, and would be treated medically rather than surgically.Caveats:Recent CT Scan &#8594; CT scan dye is heavy in iodine, so it can cause a false positive.Jod-Basedow Effect &#8594; Hyperthyroidism following excess iodine intake (eg. via dye, as described above, or as a dietary supplement).On the left would be diffuse hyperactivity, suggestive of Grave's disease. On the right would be localized hyperactivity, suggestive of a hot nodule.Radiation Uptake ScanCan be used to differentiate between a hot nodule (localized uptake), or Grave&#8217;s Disease (diffuse uptake).Beware of recent CT scans, because the contrast is high in iodine, and can cause a false positive.Grave&#8217;s DiseaseRecall from I&#38;I that Grave&#8217;s Disease was a Type II Hypersenstivity reaction.It&#8217;s an auto-immune disease that attacks the TSH receptors on the thyroid gland, and stimulates them, triggering excess T3 &#38; T4 production.This gives you symptoms of hyperthyroidism &#8594; tachycardia, fine tremor, etc.Recall that exopthalamos also occurs because of an attack on the periocular tissues.Diagnostic UltrasoundYou should perform an U/S if the TSH isn&#8217;t low, and you also have suggestive signs on Hx &#38; PE.Ultrasound is actually the most sensitive &#38; specific (over an MRI, and CT).If no nodule is found &#8594; you don&#8217;t need to biopsy it.If the patient had a high TSH, evaluate them for hypothyroidism.FNABIf a nodule is found on U/S, then you should perform an FNAB if it&#8217;s significant.It used to be significant if the U/S has detected a nodule that&#8217;s:&#62; 1cm in size or palpable.In a high risk patient (FHx, head &#38; neck radiation, etc).The guidelines have changed however, and have become much more complicated (see below).In general, you can summarize it as this however:Any nodule should get a TSH and U/S.If the nodule is just a cyst, then you don&#8217;t need to perform a FNAB.If it&#8217;s a true nodule, the consider referral for FNAB if:Solid &#62; 1cm.Complex &#62; 1.5cm.High risk patient &#62; 5mm.RememberA nodule should be biopsied if you see:Solid &#62; 1cm.Complex &#62; 1.5cm.High risk patient &#62; 5mm.Diagnosis &#38; Management of Thyroid CancerDiagnosis of Thyroid CancerDiagnosis is made from the FNAB.The interpretation of the FNAB results are as follows:Low Risk &#8594; &#60; 5% risk of malignancy.Hashimoto&#8217;s thyroiditis.Follicular hyperplasia.Benign Nodule.With these, you perform a repeat U/S at 6 mo, to see if it&#8217;s grown. After the 6 mo repeat U/S, you then have annual U/S.Intermediate Risk &#8594; 15% risk of malignancy.Follicular lesion.Follicular neoplasm.Hurthle cell lesion.Usually managed with hemi-thyroidectomy for diagnosis or serial ultrasound.High Risk &#8594; &#62;80% of malignancy.Papillary Thyroid Cancer.Other malignancy.If the FNAB comes back saying it&#8217;s &#8216;diagnostic of papillary thyroid cancer&#8217;, then it&#8217;s an even higher risk of malignancy (&#62; 99%).Managed with total thyroidectomy, with neck dissection if the cancer has spread.Indeterminate Risk &#8594; 15-50% malignant.Where we see tumour, but we&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s benign or malignant.Often due to cystic contents &#8594; we miss the tumour itself, or where the biopsy is insufficient.Usually requires re-biopsy &#8594; not a low-risk lesion!If the U/S also showed any of the following characteristics, then it increases the risk of malignancy.Micro-calcifications.Hypoechogenicity.Intra-nodal Hypervascularity.If you see suspicious features, pick the most suspicious nodule.If you don&#8217;t see suspicious features, pick the largest nodule.FNAB InterpretationLow Risk &#8594; serial ultrasound &#8594; 6 month repeat U/S, then every year.Intermediate Risk &#8594; hemi-thyroidectomy for Dx, or serial ultrasound.High Risk &#8594; total thyroidectomy, with possible neck dissection if suspicious of spread.Indeterminate Risk &#8594; often due to cystic contents, a repeat biopsy is suggested.Management of Thyroid CancerSurgery:As mentioned before, if you have a high risk FNAB result, then you have to undergo a total thyroidectome +/- central neck dissection.You should not perform a hemi-thyroidectomy in PTC &#62; 1cm.Post-op Radioactive Iodine:Used as an adjuvant in high risk disease.Also can be therapeutic, to treat distant metastases (since iodine uptake is very specific for thyroid tissue).Follow-upTry to keep the TSH &#60; 0.1, to suppress thyroid growth.Thyroid CasesCase #163 year old female.Otherwise healthy, no history of radiation exposure.Asymptomatic.Grandmother had thyroid cancer.Undergoing carotid doppler.Multiple nodules throughout gland largest measuring 0.7cm.How would you manage this finding?Reassure patient and repeat U/S in 6 months.Request an U/S FNA of largest nodule.Refer to surgeon for total thyroidectomy.Disregard the finding.RAI uptake scan to determine if it is a cold nodule.Explanation:The patient doesn&#8217;t have a low TSH, which is the only instance where you&#8217;d use a radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake scan.You only use a FNAB if there&#8217;s a solid tumour &#62; 1cm, or a complex nodule &#62; 1.5 cm, or if she&#8217;s a high risk patient. In her case, it&#8217;s only 0.7 cm, and she has no risk factors!So in this case, the answer is serial U/S &#8594; repeat after 6 months.Case #263 year old female.Otherwise healthy, no history of radiation exposure.Asymptomatic.Grandmother had thyroid cancer.Undergoing carotid doppler.Multiple nodules throughout gland largest measuring 1.7cm.(Same as Case 1, except 1.7 cm vs 0.7 cm)How would you manage this finding?Reassure patient and repeat U/S in 6 months.Request an U/S FNA of largest nodule.Refer to surgeon for total thyroidectomy.Request U/S guided FNA of smaller nodule with calcification and hypervascularity.RAI uptake scan to determine if it is a cold nodule.Explanation:Her grandmother has thyroid cancer &#8594; this is a second degree relative, not a first degree relative, so it&#8217;s not a risk factor.However, the largest nodule is 1.7 cm, so this would be something you should biopsy (&#62; 1cm).If there&#8217;s a nodule with suspicious features, remember that you always biopsy the most suspicious one!Otherwise, biopsy the largest nodule.Case #363 year old female.Otherwise healthy, no history of radiation exposure.Long history of goiter.Grandmother had thyroid cancer.Progressive dysphagia, sensation of choking, dyspnea with elevation of arms.U/S Thyroid:Diffusely, significantly, enlarged gland with multiple nodules throughout gland largest measuring 0.7cm.How would you manage this finding?Reassure patient and repeat U/S in 6 months.Request an U/S FNA of largest nodule.Refer to surgeon for total thyroidectomy.Disregard the finding.RAI uptake scan to determine if it is a cold nodule.Explanation:In this case, the patient has structural problems associated with the thyroid nodules &#8594; airway obstruction, dysphagia, etc.When you elevate your arms with a large goiter, you can displace the thyroid below the thoracic inlet, and compress the jugular vein and trachea.As before, the second-degree relative isn&#8217;t relevant.This patient doesn&#8217;t have indications for malignancy, but does have indications for a total thyroidectomy due to obstruction.Recall that there are 3 indications for thyroid surgery:Rule out/treat malignancy.Compressive symptoms.Hyperfunctional nodule/gland refractory to medical Tx.Case #433 year old female.Otherwise healthy, no history of radiation exposure.Progressive heat intolerance, sweating, tremor.No palpable thyroid nodules.TSH &#60; 0.01.How would you manage this finding?Reassure patient.RAI uptake scan to determine if it is a hot nodule.Refer to surgeon for total thyroidectomy.Request U/S guided FNA.Explanation:In this case, the patient has functional problems associated with the thyroid nodules &#8594; signs of hyperthyroidism.Recall that the only indication for an RAI uptake scan is a low TSH, to Dx a hot nodule! This is what you see here.Case #563 year old female.Otherwise healthy, no history of radiation exposure.Asymptomatic.Grandmother had thyroid cancer.Routine physical exam note new solitary thyroid nodule 2cm.How would you manage this finding?Reassure patient and repeat U/S in 6 months.FNAB then request a TSH and U/S.Refer to surgeon for total thyroidectomy.Disregard the finding.RAI uptake scan to determine if it is a cold nodule.Explanation:Note that we can basically never disregard a found nodule &#8594; the best case is a serial U/S. This is a shame, because is many cases, it may be preferential to disregard subclinical nodules.Here, the nodule &#62; 1cm, which was one of our indications for a FNAB.And as mentioned before, we should always get a TSH + U/S with any thyroid nodule.Case #643 year old female from Ukraine.Otherwise healthy.Asymptomatic.Brother had thyroid cancer.Routine physical exam note new solitary thyroid nodule 3.0cm.How would you manage this finding?Reassure patient and repeat exam in 6 months.FNAB then request a TSH and U/S.Refer to surgeon for total thyroidectomy.Disregard the finding.RAI uptake scan to determine if it is a cold nodule.Explanation:Her history suggests she may have gotten radiation exposure from the Chernobyl incident, since she&#8217;s from Ukraine!Also has a first degree relative with thyroid cancer.So she would be considered a high risk patient.So here you&#8217;d definitely do a FNAB (&#62; 0.5 mm + high risk).You&#8217;d also do a TSH + U/S, which is done with all thyroid nodules.Additional InformationTSH normal.U/S confirms 3cm thyroid solitary nodule.Also notes ipsi-lateral 2.5cm Level II lymph node.Now how would you manage this finding?Reassure patient and repeat exam in 6 months.Refer the patient to a surgeon to manage.Refer to surgeon for total thyroidectomy.Disregard the finding.RAI uptake scan to determine if it is a cold nodule.Explanation:TSH normal &#8594; not a hot nodule.The ipsi-lateral 2.4cm lymph nodes suggests possible spread.You haven&#8217;t bone the biopsy yet, so you&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s malignant yet &#8594; you wouldn&#8217;t want to remove the thyroid yet.But you are more suspicious, so you should refer to a surgeon.The surgeon should:Reassure patient and repeat exam in 6 months.Perform an FNA of the neck mass.Perform a total thyroidectomy.Perform a hemi-thyroidectomy for diagnosis.Perform an FNA of thyroid nodule.Explanation:Not only should you FNA the thyroid nodule, but you definitely should FNA the neck mass.Because if that comes back positive for thyroid cancer, then it&#8217;ll clinch the diagnosis.FNA Neck reveals Papillary thyroid cancer, the surgeon should?Reassure patient and repeat exam in 6 months.Perform a total thyroidectomy, central and lateral neck dissection.Perform a total thyroidectomy.Perform a hemi-thyroidectomy for diagnosis.Explanation:Since the lymph node was positive, there&#8217;s spread! So you need to do a neck dissection as well as a total thyroidectomy.Case #735 year old female.Rapidly enlarging palpable right thyroid mass.Grandmother had thyroid cancer.Progressive hoarseness (could be due to RLN damage).Radiation for childhood lymphoma.What symptom is NOT concerning for malignancyRapidly enlarging.Grandmother had thyroid cancer.Progressive hoarseness.Radiation for childhood lymphoma.Explanation:First degree relative is a risk factor, but not a second degree relative.Remember that the risk factors were (1) radiation, (2) first-degree relative, (3) rapid-growth, and (4) chernobyl before 14.Progressive hoarseness would be a sign of rapid growth (compression of the recurrent laryngeal).What would be your next investigation?TSH, U/S.Serum Thyroglobulin to follow possible thyroid cancer.Serum Calcitonin to rule out medullary thyroid cancer.RAI uptake scan to determine if it is a cold nodule.Explanation:TSH and U/S are standard with all nodules.If the vocal cords were paralyzed, then would be an indication for surgery (obstruction).", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/27/thyroid.html"},

If not, make it open.Breathing &#8594; are they breathing normal?Circulation &#8594; do they have a blood pressure?Keep cycling between primary survey and resuscitation until stabilized.Balance function and aesthetic demands.When you fracture something, it involves a bone.There are ligaments on top of the bone, that come off the bone, and insert into the cutaneous margins, and keep the soft tissue on the face.When you&#8217;re young, these ligaments are tight &#8594; tight faces.As you age, they start to relax, and your face looks older.Muscles &#8594; depressors, elevators, sphincters.Make sure you record the extent of damage beforehand, so you won&#8217;t be accused of causing further damage later on.Poor fracture reduction &#8594; not placed properly, won&#8217;t reattach properly, can cause appearance of premature aging.INCISIONS &#8594; there are 4 incisions with which you can expose the whole craniofacial skeleton. 1. Coronal Incision (the old scalping incision). - Exposure to cranium, down to zygomatic arch, orbit, naso-orbital ethmoid area. 2. Subciliary Incision (eyelid incision). - Right below eyelashes. - Exposure to orbital rim, anterior zygoma, maxilla. 3. Transconjunctival Incision - On the other side, just inside the eyelid. - Can get the same exposure with this incision too. - Helps hide the scar a little bit. 4. Upper Gingivobuccal Incision. - Incision inside the mouth, between teeth and cheek. - Can get exposure to the maxilla through this. 5. Lower Gingivobuccal Incision. - Same, except on the lower side of the mouth, can get exposure to the mandible.Mandible FracturesMovement of the MandibleExcursion (opening), is due to the internal medial pterygoid, masseter, temporalis.Lateral movement &#8594; side to side.Translation &#8594; front to back.Often with a jaw fracture, translation is the last axis of movement that returns.Structure of the Mandible.Areas of bone thickening of the skull &#8594; horizontal buttresses.These are areas where force is transferred through the face due to mastication.When you reconstruct someone, you want to put the horizontal buttresses back in their original place for optimal recovery.Since you can&#8217;t put on a face cast, you have to wire your jaws together &#8594; Maxillomandibular Fixation (MMF).The most important thing in repairing a jaw fracture is fixing the occlusion. You have to make sure that the teeth can meet together!How do you know if the teeth meet? You can&#8217;t talk to the patient if they&#8217;re intubated/sleep.What we use as hints instead are the vertical grooves in the teeth &#8594; called mamelons. These are worn away where your teeth occlude!So you can use these to map the occlusion.You can also map the occlusion with signs of wear.If you&#8217;re a couple of millimetres off, it&#8217;ll feel odd &#8594; it&#8217;s as if you had a tiny piece of popcorn stuck between your upper and lower teeth, offsetting them by just a bit.Feels weird!So you don&#8217;t want to place someone in the wrong occlusion!How do you know if your fix was good?Can they open their mouth with minimal chin drift? Does the chin move down straight, and not to the side?Is the inter-incisal opening normal?Do your teeth meet together properly?Preserve the mental nerve &#8594; otherwise they won&#8217;t be able to feel their teeth/lips.Naso-orbital Ethmoid FracturesOne of the most commonly missed diagnoses in facial trauma.These need a lot more care than just a nasal fracture.TAKE HOME POINT &#8594; if you have a nasal fracture, could it be a nasoorbital ethmoid fracture?What&#8217;s the difference?Naso-orbital ethmoid fractures involve parts of the ascending maxilla that are high.Medial canthal tendon of the eye inserts into the bone.When this is fractured, you get telecanthus &#8594; distance between nose and medial canthus of the eye increases.MEDIAL CANTHUS = inside corder of the eye.LATERAL CANTHUS = outside corner of the eye.TELECANTHUS = wide distance between eyes.So if you see this, could this be a peri-naso-orbital ethmoid fracture!SIGNS:Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis. (nasal fracture, naso-orbital too).Medial canthal displacement &#8594; ONLY GET THIS WITH A NASO-ORBITAL ETHMOID FRACTURE. IMPORTANT.Telecanthus &#8594; increased distance between eyes. Canthus to midline is normally 16 mm. Intercanthal distance is 30-34 mm.Of course, this should be a new telecanthus. If they always had this, isn&#8217;t worrisome.CAUSES:Low velocity &#8594; punch, kick, or high velocity &#8594; MVAs.Typ. at nasal root.CLINICAL TESTS:Bimanual test &#8594; get a little instrument to fly it up nose, put finger into medial canthus, and move it. If the bone moves too, then they have a naso-orbital ethmoid fracture.Definitive Dx is by CT.Classification (NOT IMPORTANT):Type I: Bone fragment attaching medial canthal tendon is nondisplaced.Type II: Bone fragment attaching medial canthal tendon is displaced but canthal tendon is intact and still attached to a central fragment of bone.Type III: Fragmentation and communition of the bones on which the medial canthal ligament is attached. In this type, the tendon cannot be reattached to the usual structures, as they have been communited as well.Zygomatic FracturesCheekbone fractures are probably the 3rd most common type of facial fracture.Usually due to fist-fighting.Zygoma is very thick &#8594; it usually actually fractures at its attachment points with other bones (eg. the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, the frontal bone, maxilla).Vertical buttresses (of which the zygoma is part of) &#8594; zygomatico-maxillary buttresses???!These fractures are important to repair &#8594; failure to do so can affect force transmission through the face.Two types of zygoma fracture:Type 1 &#8594; where the arch is okay.Type 2 &#8594; where the arch is fractured.You need a coronal approach to fix a type 2, but you don&#8217;t for a type 1 (could use a buccalgingival for instance).Type 2 fractures &#8594; fracture the extension onto the temporal bone. The only way to get a full exposure is via a coronal or endoscopically. Doing it endoscopically is a little challenging.Zygoma repair is ideally done within 5-7 days, otherwise the masseter starts to spasm and it&#8217;s difficult to pull the bone back out.Always get an optho consult, because the zygoma meets with the sphenoid bone within the eye.Once you release ligaments from the bone, you gotta re-attach them! If you don&#8217;t, then you&#8217;ll have premature aging of the face.Orbital FracturesForm and function.If they can&#8217;t look down &#8594; entrapment.For instance, it could be caused by a fracture of the zygoma impinging on the inferior rectus of the eye.Maxillary (Lefort) FracturesUpper jaw fractures.Lefort fractures &#8594; after Henri Lefort.Categorized into 3 groups:Lefort I &#8594; upper jaw separated from craniofacial skeleton.Lefort II &#8594; nasal bone + upper jaw separated from craniofacial skeleton.Lefort III &#8594; orbits are separated too!Because of the buttresses in the face, the maxilla generally fractures in one of these 3 ways.Testing &#8594; grab Pt&#8217;s forehead, grab their jaw, check to see if there&#8217;s any movement. If there is &#8594; Lefort fracture.Fix it the same way as an upper mandible fracture.When ppl try to close their mouth, since the upper jaw separated from the craniofacial skeleton, the back teeth meet before the front teeth do! They get an open bite deformity.As before, try to get the occlusion right first! Fixation and then reduction.Frontal Bone FracturesParanasal sinuses, frontal sinuses.Obviously a coronal exposure.Donald Classification of Frontal Sinus Fractures: 1. Anterior wall a. Linear b. Depressed c. Compound d. Extensively comminuted 2. Posterior wall a. Linear b. Depressed c. Depressed with CSF leak d. Extensively comminutedFrontonasal ductThrough-and-throughWe usually just see a plain frontal wall fracture.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/26/facial-trauma.html"},
	{"title": "Management of the Upper Airway", "text": "Airway Obstruction1. DefinitionObstruction &#8594; blockage of airflow. This can either be complete or incomplete.Don&#8217;t forget that there are two passages for airflow &#8594; the nose and the mouth! You can intubate someone through either.If airway obstruction isn&#8217;t corrected quickly, it can cause brain damage and even death.2. Etiology(1) Tumours, (2) trauma, (3) infections, and (4) allergic reactions make up the bulk of the causes of airway obstruction.In children, foreign body aspiration is also a significant cause.For example, obstruction can be caused by a tonsilar abcess &#8594; infection (seen on the right).RememberCauses of airway obstruction include:Tumours.Trauma.Infections.Allergic Reactions.Foreign Body Aspiration &#8594; especially in children.3. Risk FactorsDecreased Level of Consciousness &#8594; eg. due to narcotics.Infection, TumoursObesity &#8594; especially since it&#8217;s associated with sleep apnea.Trauma, Burns &#8594; because burns can cause rapid swelling.Systemic Disease &#8594; for instance, rheumatoid arthritis can cause arthritic changes to the TMJ, and the arytenoids, affecting opening of the jaw and the vocal cords respectively.Sleep Apnea &#8594; obstruction of the airway during sleep.4. SignsChoking.Nasal Flaring &#8594; an especially important sign in children, who may not be able to convey distress as easily.Accessory Muscle Use &#8594; for instance the scalene muscles of the neck may be strained.Snoring &#8594; extremely loud snoring is suggestive of sleep apnea.Stridor &#8594; Stridor is a high pitched crowing sound.Abdominal Paradox &#8594; instead of the abdomen expanding during inhalation, it contracts! This is suggestive of accessory muscle use (such as the intercostals), one cause of which is respiratory distress.Cyanosis.5. SymptomsAir Hunger &#8594; they start gasping for air.Agitation, DisorientationDyspneaHoarseness &#8594; especially if the obstruction is at the level of the glottis, and is interfering with the approximation of the vocal folds.Dysphagia &#8594; difficulty swallowing.Odynophagia &#8594; pain when swallowing.Non-Surgical Management of Airway ObstructionLook, listen, &#38; feel.Can you see the chest rise or fall?Can you hear breath sounds? Can you feel breath sounds?Head tilt and chin lift &#8594; lifting the chin helps move the tongue off the posterior pharyngeal wall.Jaw Thrust &#8594; used in patients with a potential C-spine injury.Obviously, if the patient has a neck injury, you want to keep the neck as static as possible. So a head tilt and chin lift may not be that great an idea.Instead you can do a Jaw Thrust &#8594; you pull up the jaw by the mandible, and open the mouth slightly simultaneously.This lets you open the airway without moving the neck.Suction Pharynx &#8594; you can use suction to remove and secretions and possible foreign bodies that are lodged in the pharynx.Reposition the Patient &#8594; if you don't suspect a C-spine injury, then placing a pillow under the patient&#8217;s head will help open their airway.Oral/Nasal Airways &#8594; consider nasal/oral intubation.Never nasally intubate a patient if you suspect head trauma.This is because there could be damage to the cribriform plate separating the nasal cavity from the base of the skull, so sticking a tube in there might be a bad idea.If the patient has a clotting disorder, it&#8217;s also contraindicated &#8594; there&#8217;s significant nasal blood flow!Supplemental O2.Assisted Ventilation &#8594; Bag &#38; Mask.RememberNasal intubation is contraindicated in patients with:Head Trauma.Coagulopathies.Bag Mask VentilationThe C-Grip &#8594; maintain the face seal with your index finger and thumb positioned as in the picture.The remaining 3 fingers are used to lift the jaw into the mask.These 3 fingers should be on the bony prominences of the jaw &#8594; if you keep them on the soft tissue, you might actually worsen the obstruction.The other hand pumps oxygen via the O2 bag.Laryngeal Mask AirwayLaryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) &#8594; a simple, effective, and cheap airway rescue device. They&#8217;re ubiquitous!It&#8217;s placed into the mouth, into the throat, and sits above the glottis &#8594; it&#8217;s a supraglottic device.This differentiates it from an endotracheal tube, which goes into the trachea.Recall that the right main stem bronchi was particularly susceptible because of its steeper angle.Because it sits above the vocal cords, it does not protect against aspiration, where foreign bodies can get stuck in the bronchi.RememberThe Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is a supraglottic device &#8594; it sits above the glottis!The Endotracheal Tube is a subglottic device &#8594; it goes below the glottis, into the trachea!Corollary &#8594; a LMA would not protect against foreign body aspiration, because the obstruction would be distal to the device.7. IntubationIntubation is not only important for maintaining oxygenation and ventilation, but also for clearing secretions &#8594; this is known as tracheal toilet.How do you intubate someone?Evaluate the airway by Hx and P/E, to determine how difficult it will be.For instance, some patients will have a larger tongue, or a recessed jaw, which will make intubation more challenging.Physical Exam Findings &#8594; ideally, the mouth should look like what&#8217;s seen to the right.P/E findings that may complicate intubation include:Decreased mouth opening.The inability to see the entire uvula upon mouth opening.A small chin.Prominent teeth.Morbid obesity.Poor cervical spine mobility.The Mallampati ScoreThe Mallampati score is an assessment of how easy it will be to visualize the glottis. It&#8217;s based on how much of the uvula we can see.Class I &#8594; Soft palate, uvula, fauces, pillars visible.Class II &#8594; Soft palate, uvula, fauces visible.Class III &#8594; Soft palate, base of uvula visible.Class IV &#8594; Only hard palate visible.The space between the base of the tongue and the epiglottis is called the vallecula. It&#8217;s what you stick the blade of your laryngoscope into when you pull the tongue out of the way.The Mallampati ScoreThe Mallampati Score tells us how easy it will be to get a good view of the glottis:Class I &#8594; Soft palate, uvula, fauces, pillars visible.Class II &#8594; Soft palate, uvula, fauces visible.Class III &#8594; Soft palate, base of uvula visible.Class IV &#8594; Only hard palate visible.Equipment for IntubationThe equipment you need for intubation can be remembered with the STATICS acronym:S &#8594; Scope (laryngoscope).T &#8594; Tube (7.0 mm &#38; 8.0 mm).7.0 mm for women.8.0 mm for men.A &#8594; Airways (oral &#38; nasal).T &#8594; Tape. To keep your endotracheal tube in place.I &#8594; Introducer &#38; Intravenous.Introducer &#8594; the firm stylette you use to shape the endotracheal tube.Intravenous &#8594; used because intubating someone can cause significant hemodynamic changes. So you want to be able to rapidly administer medications.C &#8594; Circuit &#8594; the circuit we use to oxygenate and ventilate the patient.S &#8594; Suction &#38; Syringe to inflate the endotracheal tube cup.Equipment for IntubationEquipment for intubation can be remembered with the STATICS acronym:S &#8594; Scope.T &#8594; Tube (7.0 mm in women, 8.0 mm in men).A &#8594; Airways (oral or nasal).T &#8594; Tape.I &#8594; Introducer &#38; Intravenous.C &#8594; Circuit.S &#8594; Suction &#38; Syringe.Pharmacological AgentsIntubating someone will usually cause their sympathetic tone to increase, if they&#8217;re still conscious.So medications are often used to assist with intubation.Topical anesthetics and muscle relaxants.Atropine is also used. Recall that atropine is an anti-muscarinic, so it&#8217;ll block salivation, which is useful. (Don&#8217;t forget that SLUDGE acronym).Performing an IntubationMonitor vitals (Sats, RR, BP, HR, Temp).Put the patient in &#8220;sniffing position&#8221; &#8594; with the neck flexed back, and the head pulled out.Hold the laryngoscope in (L) hand &#38; insert it into the patient&#8217;s mouth.Sweep the tongue away with the blade of the laryngoscope.Advace the blade to the midline until the epiglottis is seen.Lift the tongue to expose the glottis.Hold the endotracheal tube in (R) hand, and advance it through the vocal cords.Make sure you actually see it going through the vocal cords, and that you didn&#8217;t accidentally put it down the esophagus.Place the the end past the vocal cords!Inflate the cuff to obtain the seal.Check the tube placement:To ensure that it was inserted properly, see if the chest is rising or falling, or if there&#8217;s condensation in the tube.Listen over the lung fields.What if you can&#8217;t perform the Intubation?Call for Help!Continue to ventilate by Bag &#38; mask, or LMA.Reposition the head &#38; Neck.Change the ETT size.Change the blade size or type.Get someone to apply pressure on the larynx &#8594; helps you see the glottis.Complications of IntubationThere are a lot of complications, but they can be easily figured out by looking at the steps involved with intubation:Positioning the Head &#8594; C-spine trauma.Inserting the Scope &#8594; soft tissue trauma, dental trauma, sore throat/jaw, etc.Placing the Tube &#8594; hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis, bronchospasm, laryngospasm.Physiological Response &#8594; to the stress of intubation (high sympathetic tone &#8594; HR&#8593;, hypertension), or because of the decreased airflow (hypoxia, hypercarbia).Making a mistake &#8594; bronchial (went too far), or esophageal (went into the wrong tube) intubation.In patients that have to be chronically intubated there may be an inflammatory response.This can result in the formation of vocal cord granulomas, as seen to the right.Case ExampleA 17 y/o patient presents for an emergency drainage of a submandibular abcess.What are important considerations during the preop. evaluation of the patient?How should be intubated?NotesThe submandibular abcess may prevent a good mask seal.Patients with hypopharyngeal disease depend on awake muscle tone to maintain airway patency &#8594; if you try to put them to sleep, then it will make things much worse!Because of the abcess, there may be decreased TMJ mobility &#8594; a nasal approach should be considered.Evaluate the patient for airway obstruction and hypoxia.Physical Exam:Severe facial edema limits mandible motion and prevents a good mask fit.Frank pus is seen in the mouth.Because of the aforementioned observations, an awake/nasal intubation is preferred.Because this is a difficult case, you should also be prepared for an emergency surgical airway.Surgical Management of Airway ObstructionAs previously mentioned, there are two openings to the airway &#8594; the nose and the mouth.You can make a third opening through the neck! That&#8217;s what a surgical airway aims to do!Note: Even if you can&#8217;t intubate a patient, if you can still ventilate them (bag-mask, LMA), then it&#8217;s okay!If you can neither intubate nor ventilate someone, that&#8217;s when you go for the neck.• The basics of airway assessment • Indications for tracheostomy• Is the patient dying? • History (if patient is not dead or dying) • Examination – The quick screen – The full evaluation • Is there a need for intubation? • Is there a need for a surgical airway? • Surgical technique• NeckExtended-(C-spine) • Horizontalincision (cricoid - notch) • Separatestrapmusclessequentially • Identify airway +/- divide isthmus NOTHING TO HURT IN THE MIDLINE! Won&#8217;t nick a nerve or cut a vessel along the midline!• Measure rings - (2nd/3rd) lowest safe ring (except cancer&#8230;) • Alert anaesthesia • Enter airway, suction. Enlarge tracheostomy • Place tracheostomy - confirm position (CO2)", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/26/upper-airway-management.html"},

	{"title": "Physiology &amp; Clinical Aspects of Hoarseness", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesAnatomy of the larynx (review).Physiology of phonation.Basic clinical approach to hoarseness.Be familiar with common laryngeal problems and their management.Anatomy of the LarynxSkeletal Elements:Hyoid Bone &#8594; hyoid, higher!Thyroid Cartilage &#8594; the Adam&#8217;s apple.Cricoid Cartilage &#8594; ring below the thyroid.Miscellaneous Elements:Arytenoids.Corniculate cartilage.Cuneiform cartilage.Subsites of the LarynxThese are subregions of the larynx.Supraglottis &#8594; above the glottis.Glottis &#8594; refers to the vocal folds.Subglottis &#8594; below the glottis.Components of the LarynxBolded elements are important.Supraglottis &#8594; Epiglottis, Aryepiglottic folds, False Vocal Folds, Arytenoids, Ventricle.Glottis &#8594; the True Vocal Folds (TVFs)Subglottis &#8594; Below the TVF&#8217;s, to the lower border of cricoid.The epiglottis is the &#8216;toilet seat&#8217; that protects the airway.The subglottis then continues down into the trachea, joining the upper and lower airways.Components of the LarynxSupraglottis &#8594; above the vocal folds.Glottis &#8594; at the vocal folds.Subglottis &#8594; below the vocal folds, to the lower border of the cricoid.Intrinsic vs Extrinsic MusclesExtrinsic muscles &#8594; muscles on the outside of the larynx.These are all innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X).These are also known as the strap muscles.The recurrent laryngeal nerve is also referred to as the inferior laryngeal nerve by anatomists.Intrinsic muscles &#8594; muscles on the inside of the larynx.Innervation of the intrinsic muscles is somewhat more complicated.They&#8217;re also innervated by branches of the vagus nerve, namely the:Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN).Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (RLN).The crichothyroid muscle lets you adjust the pitch of the vocal cords by pulling down the thyroid cartilage.For the Superior Laryngeal Nerve:There is an external branch that provides motor innervation to the cricothyroid muscle &#8594; this is the only muscle innervated by the SLN!There is an internal branch that provides sensory innervation to the upper larynx (supraglottis &#38; glottis).For the Recurrent Laryngeal NerveProvides motor innervation to all the intrinsic muscles except the crichothyroid.Also provides sensory innervation to the lower larynx (subglottis).Muscles of the LarynxExtrinsic MusclesAlso known as the strap muscles.Motor and sensory innervation is provided by the vagus.Intrinsic MusclesInnervated by branches of the vagus &#8594; the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve.The Superior Laryngeal Nerve supplies:Motor innervation to the cricothyroid.Sensory innervation to the upper larynx (supraglottis + glottis).The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve supplies:Motor innervation to intrinsic muscles excluding the cricothyroid.Sensory innervation to the lower larynx (subglottis).The vagus is a vagrant &#8594; its branches have a long and tortuous branch.Of particular importance is the path of the left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves.Both the right and left RLN go down between the trachea and esophagus, and &#8216;recur&#8217; back up at different locations:The left RLN loops around the aortic arch.The right RLN loops around the right subclavian artery.Hence, the left RLN takes a longer path.Why is this important?Anything that affects the nerve along this pathway can result in some degree of vocal cord paralysis &#8594; hoarseness.One example of this would be a heart/lung operation. Since the left RLN takes a longer path (it loops around the aortic arch and the ligamentum arteriosum), it&#8217;s generally more vulnerable to damage!RememberThe left RLN loops around the aortic arch.The right RLN loops around the right SLN.This is what you see clinically.The two flaps are the two true vocal cords, past which we enter the subglottis, and the start of the lower airway.The large flap anterior to the TVFs is the epiglottis.Physiology of the LarynxAirway protection &#8594; everyone thinks of phonating first and foremost, but the larynx actually plays a key role in protecting the airways!Respiration &#8594; the vocal cords open when you breathe in, and close when you breathe out. If a patient has bilateral recurrent nerve paralysis or a brainstem problem preventing this from happening, you end up with stridor.Phonation.Physiology of PhonationThe normal vocal fold frequency is around 100 cycles/second if you&#8217;re male, and around 200 cycles/second if you&#8217;re female.How do we create such fast vibrations?We obviously can&#8217;t move muscles at 100s of cycles per second.This occurs by bringing the vocal cords together &#8594; as air pushes through the slit formed by the TVFs, since the cords are elastic, it&#8217;ll cause them to vibrate.Clinical Approach to HoarsenessHistory.Physical examination.Investigations.HistoryDemographics:Age (young or old), Occupation, Recreational voice use/abuse.For instance, patients who use their voice for a living (singers, lawyers), would be more susceptible to hoarseness.Hoarseness:Timing &#8594; progressive, intermittent, what makes it better/worse.Risk factors:Cancer &#8594; smoking, drinking (SocHx).Trauma &#8594; external injury, internal injury (intubation, burn, reflux).Surgery &#8594; thyroid, chest (since it&#8217;s along the path of laryngeal nerves).Other ENT symptoms:Neck lumps, dysphagia (swallowing problems).The larynx is by the pharynx, so look at related structures and associated symptoms too.For instance, the pharynx is responsible for swallowing.Misc symptoms:Weight loss, hypothyroid, fever, sore throat.Physical ExaminationYou should (1) look, (2) listen and (3) feel:Look at the neck/chest:Are there any scars?Is there swelling of the neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland &#8594; Goiter.Listen to the voice:Quality &#8594; Breathy? Raspy? Coarse? Stridor?Inspiratory = stridor = suggestive of upper airway problem.Expiratory = wheeze = suggestive of lower airway problem.Biphasic = in-between.Intensity &#8594; soft? loud?Pitch &#8594; too low? too high?Listen for other &#8220;voice&#8221; problemsCould be a problem with articulation (dysarthria), or with resonance (eg. hypernasality).Dysarthria (difficult/unclear articulation) could occur with a neuromuscular problem, stroke, etc. that affects tongue movement, affecting articulation.Hypernasality is where patients have increased airflow through the nose, such as with a cleft palate (where there&#8217;s incomplete closure of the soft palate).Feel the neck &#8594; lumps, painful areas.Goiter = swelling of the neck due to thyroid enlargement.You can idenfity various features of the larynx on CT as follows:Thyroid carilage &#8594; will look like a shield &#8594; closed on the front, open on the back.Hyoid bone &#8594; will look a bit like a stealth fighter, with two wings.Crichoid ring &#8594; will be an enclosed ring.CT, saw deviation of the larynx, because of a huge ass tumour.Ouch?InvestigationsWhen investigating problems with hoarseness, begin by addressing two questions:Is it organic or non-organic?Is it structural or functional?1. Is it organic or non-organic?In other words, is it real, or is it not real?Some people may come in with a funny voice because of psychogenic causes. Usually this isn&#8217;t the case.2. Is it structural or functional?If it&#8217;s actually an organic problem, then it can be either structural or functional:Structural &#8594; some type of anatomical problem.Functional &#8594; some type of physiological problem.That is, is it a problem with the structure, or with how it works.A good analogy is with a bad piano player &#8594; is the piano untuned or do you just not know how to play?Examples of Organic Voice ProblemsStructural problems:Mucosal problem &#8594; infection, inflammation, Reinke&#8217;s edema (swelling of the vocal cords), hyperkeratosis (scabbing).Vocal cord lumps &#8594; nodule, polyp, granuloma (eg. inflammatory response after intubation), cancer, papilloma (caused by HPV).Functional problems:Could be a problem with the nerve, the muscle, or something in-between (the neuromuscular-junction).Nerve Problem &#8594; vocal cord paralysis (could be nerve damage anywhere from the skull base to the aortic arch).Muscle Problem &#8594; tremors, eg. spasmodic dysphonia (uncontrollable tremor of the vocal cords).NMJ Problem &#8594; eg. Myasthenia gravis.Miscellaneous Problems &#8594; Hypothyroid, rheumatic arthritis.Examples of Non-Organic Voice ProblemsYou don&#8217;t need to know these.These are multidimensional:Hyperkinetic Dysphonia:Caused by voice use/misuse/abuse.This can be due to occupational or recreational causes.Psychologic/psychiatric dysphonia:Conversion disorders &#8594; neurological cause without any functional problem. Often due to severe mental stress.This can cause hysterical aphonia, for instance.These are treated with a team approach &#8594; MD, laryngologist, speech language pathologist, psychologist, etc.1. Examples of Anatomical (Structural) ProblemsPapillomaCaused by HPV-6, and HPV-11.Can cause lumps in the throat, which are removed surgically.These lumps tend to recur.Lumps can also appear elsewhere in the body &#8594; not taught in this block!HemangiomaThese are not very common.Benign large tumour of the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.The characteristic presentation of this would be an old person with progressive SOB.PolypsThis is very common.The characteristic presentation of this an obese female who smokes a few packs of cigarettes a day.When she picks up the phone and answers, she is mistaken for a man!Polyps are a response to insult &#8594; examples include excessive voice use, smoking, or reflux secondary to obesity.The decreased voice pitch is due to the mass of the polyps, which slow the rate of vocal cord vibration.Treatment is usually by excision, and smoking-cessation advocacy.Vocal Cord MassThis is an example of early vocal cord cancer.In this case, it can be easily lopped off with a laser (leaving an appropriate surgical margin, of course).This is done with endoscopic laser surgery nowadays, so you don&#8217;t have to cut the neck open to get to the larynx.Advanced Laryngeal CancerThis is a large excised laryngeal tumour:Note the epiglottis and the thyroid cartilage, which are distinguishable from the rest of the tumour mass.In these severe cases, you have to cut out the larynx, and bring the trachea up out through the neck.Patients with a laryngectomy end up with a stoma &#8594; they have to breathe through their neck!More Common (Less Exciting) ProblemsLaryngitis &#8594; think reflux, or an infection.VC nodules &#8594; think voice abuse.Reinke&#8217;s edema (edema of the vocal folds) &#8594; think smoking, voice abuse, refluxTreatment of all of the above:Think voice therapy.Do not think surgery.2. Examples of Physiological (Functional) ProblemsBilateral Vocal Cord ParalysisThese are typically due to brain problems &#8594; tumours, stroke, neuropathy.Treatment:Always secure the airway first &#8594; if both vocal cords are paralyzed, you won&#8217;t have a patent airway!Specific treatment depends on the cause.Unilateral Vocal Cord ParalysisThese are typically due to nerve damage &#8594; eg. to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which provides motor innervation to everything except the cricothyroid.Since this could be a problem anywhere from the skull base to the aortic arch, a CT scan of the neck/chest is suggested.TreatmentWait and see to determine whether the body will compensate.Voice therapy.Move the other cord to the middle so that the two cords will adduct properly. If they can come together, you can generate a normal voice! This is done by:Medialization &#8594; surgically add an implant to push the other vocal cord closer.Injection Laryngoplasty &#8594; inject something into the other vocal cord to make it bigger.Other movement problemsThese can be generalized tremors or focal tremors.Generalized tremor &#8594; vocal cord tremor.Focal tremor &#8594; spasmodic dysphonia.With focal tremors, botox is often useful to reduce &#8216;twitchiness&#8217;.The patient could also have weak cords, eg. due to Myasthenia gravis, ALS, bulbar palsy, etc.Hoarseness Red FlagsPersistent (&#62; 10 weeks), or progressive.Positive risk factors &#8594; smoking, drinking, obesity, etc.Associated symptoms:Dysphagia &#8594; painful/difficult swallowing.Otalgia &#8594; ear pain.Airway problems.When you have no idea what is going on.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/25/physiology-clinical-aspects-hoarseness.html"},

The patient denies past medical problems.Physical examinationThe patient looks ill and is in respiratory distress at rest. Respiratory rate is increased at 30 breaths/minute. Temperature is 39.2&#176;C. Pulse rate is 130/minute. Blood pressure is 105/60 mmHg supine and 75/50 mmHg sitting up. Auscultation of the lung fields reveals extensive bilateral inspiratory crackles. Auscultation of the heart is normal, except for the tachycardia.CXRDiffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates.Arterial Blood GasesPaO2 = 54 mmHg.pH = 7.52PaCO2 = 25 mmHg.HCO3 = 24 mmol/L.SaO2 = 87%NotesPatient is tachypnic, tachycardic.Hypoventilation = PCO2 greater than 45 mmHg.Hyperventilation = PCO2 less than 25 mmHg.PO2 of 54 mmHg is hypoxemic, and this makes you hyperventile because of the hypoxic ventilatory drive.1. Discuss a brief differential diagnosis.The Diffuse Bilateral Alveolar Infiltrates suggest:Infection &#8594; Pneumonia, since this is acute.Could be CAP, or could be immunocompromised because of his IVDU Hx.The most common causes of CAP were S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Mycoplasma.2. What two tests would best secure a diagnosis?A CXR and ABG have already been done.We could also get a sputum sample or a bronchoscope with sunctioning &#38; lavage.HIV serology, or CBC to see CD4+/CD8+ inversion.3. What specific therapy would you offer?If it was community acquired pneumonia:Macrolides (&#60;65, no comorbidities) or fluoroquinolones (&#62;65, comorbidities).If it was PCP secondary to HIV:Trimethoprim Sulfamethoxazole (Septra).Steroids to deal with inflammation.Case 16A case of dyspnea and weight loss in a smokerA 60 year old man presents with a 6 month history of non-productive cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. He is a 50 pack-year cigarette smoker.Physical examinationThe patient&#8217;s respiratory rate is 20/minute. Examination of the right posterior hemithorax reveals the following: reduced movement, dullness to percussion, diminished tactile and vocal fremitus, and reduced breath sounds.CXRThe chest x-ray reveals a right pleural effusion and right hilar enlargement.Notes6 month history suggests that it may not be acute.Dullness to percussion in the right lower chest could be due to 3 thingsConsolidationPleural EFfusionAtelectasisBecause there&#8217;s reduced resonance, it&#8217;s not consolidation (would have increased resonance)Can differentiate between pleural effusion and atelectasis by putting the patient in the lateral decubitus position to see if the sound changes, or you see fluid moving to the dependent areas in the CXR.1. What basic pulmonary abnormalities cause a dull percussion note? What about the reduced breath sounds?As we said before, dullness to percussion in the right lower chest could be due to:ConsolidationPleural EffusionAtelectasis2. What initial investigations would you perform?Lateral decubitus CXR.Ultrasound to determine if it&#8217;s fluid.Diagnostic Thoracentesis to determine what the fluid it is!Better make sure it&#8217;s in the right spot (ultrasound guided).Also, you put the needle directly above the rib because the nerves run directly below the rib.Also better make sure his INR is normal &#8594; don&#8217;t want to cause a bloody mess.Should also do a CBC to have reference values to compare the pleural fluid to.Send the fluid to microbiology, cytology for cancer, AFB for tuberculosis (always test for TB).Would also do biochemistry to determine whether it&#8217;s transutive (low-protein) or exudative (high-protein). Assess protein levels, like LDH.Also check for low glucose (would be more suggestive of empyema).3. Why may it be beneficial to distinguish a exudative from a transudative pleural effusion?Most of the effusions we tap are exudates.Transudates (low protein, low LDH), would be caused by things that affect hydrostatic or oncotic pressures:Cirrhosis (liver failure)Nephrotic Syndrome (renal failure)CHFEverything else, such as infections or malignancy, would be an exudate.4. List the most common causes of a transudative and a exudative pleural effusion?We listed the 3 causes of transudative effusions above.For exudative effusions, we generally have infections, malignancy, pancreatitis, etc.5. The pleural fluid cytology is positive for adenocarcinoma. The patient&#8217;s effusion is large, recurrent, and symptomatic (i.e., dyspnea). What treatment can you offer?He&#8217;s stage 4 because he has malignant cells in this pleural space &#8594; this is inoperable.We could remove the fluid again to relieve symptoms and stabilize the patient. &#8594; a repeat tap.If the patient has end-stage cancer, with widespread mets, palliation would be considered.If the pleural fluid keeps rapidly accumulating, a chest tube could be used.Once the fluid is gone, we would try to do a pleurodesis, where we insert a drug that&#8217;ll scar the pleural surface, such as talc or tetracycline (now taken off the market).Our goal is to scar the pleural surface enough that the fluid doesn&#8217;t come back.If this doesn&#8217;t work, we can do a surgical pleurodesis.In some cases, a Denver pleural shunt is used to transfer pleural fluid into the peritoneal cavity. We basically exchange a pleural effusion for ascites.Used in terminal cases for palliation &#8594; obviously ascites isn&#8217;t a good thing, but it gives the patient a better quality of life than with a pleural effusion.Case 17An abnormal CXR in a young womanA 25 year old woman has bilateral hilar adenopathy on a routine chest x-ray. She is asymptomatic, except for slight fatigue over the past month. She is a non-smoker.Physical examinationNormal.InvestigationsSpirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity of the lung, and arterial blood gases are all normal.CBC is normal and liver enzymes are slightly elevated.Due to the suspected diagnosis, fiberoptic bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy is performed. Non-caseating granulomata are found in the biopsy. Special stains of the tissue are negative for TB and fungal organisms.1. What is the most likely diagnosis? Suggest a brief differential diagnosis.Enlarged bilateral hila.Paramediastinal lympadenopathy.Sarcoidosis:Stage I &#8594; just the lympadenopathy.Stage II &#8594; lympadenopathy + pulmonary infiltratesStage III &#8594; just the pulmonary infiltrate.Non-caseating granulomas = SarcoidosisCaseating granulomas = TuberculosisAdditionally could be an infection, possible metastasis, lymphoma (especially Hodgkin&#8217;s).2. Describe three possible extrapulmonary manifestations of this disease.Erythema nodosum. &#8594; tender red nodules on the shins.Uveitis &#8594; sore eyes, inflammation of the uveal tissue.Hypercalcemia because of increased calcium absorption from the gut.CNS, renal involvement, etc.3. Stage the intrathoracic manifestations of this disease according to the radiographic findings at presentation.Sarcoidosis:Stage I &#8594; just the lympadenopathy.Stage II &#8594; lympadenopathy + pulmonary infiltratesStage III &#8594; just the pulmonary infiltrate.As mentioned before, this was Stage I.4. Describe and justify your management strategy, including follow-up tests.Since the patient is asymptomatic, you would just observe, and follow-up regularly.Does not have any symptoms that would make you worry enough that you would give her prednisone.If the patient had inflammatory conditions such as painful erythema nodosum or uveitis, would give her an anti-inflammatory.Case 18Severe hypoxemia following multiple traumaA 30-year-old man requires intubation and mechanical ventilation following multiple trauma in a motor vehicle crash. Injuries included a closed head injury with cerebral contusions, fracture of the right femur, pelvic fracture and suspected laceration of the liver. Multiple blood transfusions are required. Following laparotomy for repair of a liver laceration and stabilization of the fractures he is transferred to the ICU.Chest x-ray on admission to the ICU reveals extensive bilateral air space disease. It was noted that his CXR when he first came to the ER was normal.Initial vital signs in the ICU are stable with a systemic blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 beats/minute. A pulmonary artery catheter is inserted and reveals a normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 10 mmHg with a high cardiac output. While breathing 100% oxygen on a mechanical ventilator with a tidal volume of 800 mL/breath at a rate of 16 breaths /minute arterial blood gases reveal a PaO2 of 40 mmHg, a PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, a pH of 7.46, and a SaO2 of 75%.1. What is the most likely diagnosis accounting for this man&#8217;s hypoxemia? Justify your answer.ARDS &#8594; Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, due to lung injury.Severe hypoxemia that is refractive to oxygen therapy.Careful to tell you that the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was normal, which suggests that it isn&#8217;t heart failure.So this is permeability associated pulmonary edema, not hydrostatic &#8594; non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.2. In physiologic terms, what is the cause of the severe hypoxemia?Endotracheal tube pumping 100% oxygen into his lungs, but despite that, his PO2 is 40.So much fluid in his lungs, that gas exchange can&#8217;t happen.This is pulmonary shunt &#8594; perfusion to an alveolus, but no ventilation.3. List the settings that this disease commonly occurs in.Multiple transfusions.Trauma &#38; major burns.Near drowning.Sepsis.Mortality rate of ARDS is very high, especially due to comorbidities patients often.4. What single action is most likely to improve the hypoxemia quickly, and why?You already have him intubated, and you&#8217;re giving him 100% oxygen.PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) to keep air in the alveoli so they stay open and do not collapse.Splints the alveoli and airways open, and increases airway pressure and push the fluid back.There is a limit to how high you can increase the pressure &#8594; you don&#8217;t want to cause a pneumothorax.Extracorporeal oxygenation used in very unusual circumstances, very rare.Case 19A 58 year old housewife presents to her family doctor with progressive shortness of breath. Her symptoms started three years previously with paroxysms of nonproductive cough and exertional dyspnea. Presently, her exercise tolerance has deteriorated to the point where she is unable to do her household chores. She is a nonsmoker. There is no significant occupational history. She denies other medical illnesses.Physical examinationThe patient, at rest, has a respiratory rate of 24/minute. Cyanosis is not present. There is clubbing of the fingers and toes. Auscultation of the lung fields reveals mid to late inspiratory crackles in both bases. Pulse rate is 90/minute. Auscultation of the heart reveals a loud S2. Jugular venous pressure is not elevated. The rest of the physical examination is normal.Arterial Blood GasesPaO2 = 60 mmHg.pH = 7.45PaCO2 = 30 mmHg.HCO3 = 22 mmol/L.SaO2 = 90%Chest X-RayThere are bilateral small irregular shadows (reticulonodular infiltrates), most evident in the lower lobes. The degree of inspiration is poor although the radiology technologist states that the film was taken at full inspiration. Interstitial lung disease is suspected.NotesPatient is hyperventilating (normal is 40), but she&#8217;s hypoxemic.We see global decreases in lung volume, but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal.Whether the change Diffusing capacity helps classify whether it&#8217;s parenchymalThis is suggestive of a restrictive lung disease.Whether the diffusing capacity is proportional or not to the volume changes can tell us whether the restrictive lung disease is parenchymal or extraparenchymal.1. List the major disease categories considered in the classification of diffuse infiltrative lung disease.Most are of unknown etiology like IPF, and sarcoidosis.There are also causes of DILD that have known etiology &#8594; these must be ruled out first before we call it idiopathic!Drug ingestion (amiodarone, methotrexate, bleomycin, nitrofurentoin)Organic and non-organic environmental exposure.See the lecture on Diffuse Interstitial Lung Diseases for examples.Most common form of idiopathic DILD is IPF = Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Will see honeycombing in the CT.2. Describe the &#8220;expected&#8221; static lung volume and diffusing capacity measurements in a patient with severe diffuse infiltrative lung disease. What do the blood gases show?Parenchymal: disproportionate decrease in DLCOExtraparenchymal: proportionate decrease in DLCOSince idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is parenchymal, we have a disproportionate drop in the DLCO compared to the lung volumes.3. What diseases (name 3) may be considered in the differential diagnosis of clubbing?IPF is the most common adult cause of clubbing. Could also be cyanotic congenital heart disease or cystic fibrosis. Can be idiopathic or run in families.Recall Shamroth&#8217;s Sign for clubbing.4. A diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is made after a number of investigations. What is the treatment?No curative treatment, aside from a lung transplant.Would just give supportive therapy &#8594; oxygen.New drug called Pirfenidone, that may slow the progression of IPF, but is extraordinarily expensive (50,000 a year).Note, as an aside, if a patient has Cor pulmonale &#8594; give oxygen to ameliorate the hypoxic vasoconstriction.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/20/respiratory-medicine-small-group.html"},

She was apprehended by the Children&#8217;s Aid Society at age 2 years due to malnutrition.Does she have fetal alcohol syndrome?Facial FeaturesSmooth filtrum &#8594; the ridges between your nose and your lips is smoothed!Short palpebral fissures &#8594; palpebral fissures are the distance between the inner and outer portion of the eyes.Thin Upper LipMicrocephaly &#8594; small head size.Midfacial hypoplasia &#8594; flat profile due to less growth around the cheeks.Features of Fetal Alcohol SyndromeFetal Alcohol Syndrome is not a genetic syndrome.It was first described by a geneticist, but it&#8217;s not a genetic syndrome itself.It&#8217;s completely preventable.Alcohol exposure during development can affect proper development.TeratogensTeratogen = any agent that can cause a malformation in a fetus exposed in-utero.Major teratogenic agents include:Infections &#8594; rubella, any of the herpesviruses.Maternal disorders &#8594; most common one is maternal diabetes.If the mother is poorly controlled during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, the high glucose level can be teratogenic.Not completely sure why this is the case, could be due to changes in oncotic pressure, which affect blood flow through the placenta.Also, in response to high glucose levels, the baby will make increased insulin to try and compensate.Insulin is a growth factor, so the baby will be very large, and will have problems related to this. One example is a hypertrophied septum.Drugs &#8594; Thalidomide is the archetypical example. Used in mothers to prevent morning sickness, and caused severe limb defects.Ionizing radiation &#8594; not really directly teratogenic so much as a contributing to mutations.All of these are preventable causes of malformationFactors Influencing TeratogenicityTiming of exposureDosageFetal genotypeMaternal genotypeTiming of ExposureLots of CNS development in the first 3-5 weeks, so this period is critical.The red period denotes highly susceptible periods, while the heart shows less sensitive periods.So the heart is completely insensitive to teratogens after 8 weeks, but won&#8217;t have problems afterwards!Note that the vast majority of the sensitive periods are within the first 8 weeks.Hence, the first 8 weeks is a highly susceptible period.The nervous system remains sensitive to teratogens throughout gestation.Periods of SensitivityPreimplantation: (0-7 days) - &#8220;all or none&#8221; period with insult causing death or having no effects. Either you have no effects or death.Organogenesis: (7 days to 8 weeks) – crucial period when structural malformations may occur with exposures.Fetal maturation: (8 weeks to 9 months) – exposure may result in functional deficits.DefinitionsMalformationsAbnormal development of tissueRecurrence risk depends on the underlying diagnosisAlways look for other malformations!DeformationsAlteration in shape of a normal tissue by mechanical forcesRecurrence risk usually low unless deforming force persistsEither some extrinsic or intrinsic cause has distorted the shape.An archetypical example is club feet, which is often due to restriction due to reduced amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios).Could also be because of another cause, due to affected brain development affecting movement of the feet.Disruptions  breakdown of normal tissue due to a destructive force  recurrence risk usually very low. - Example to the right is a lost digit where the amniotic band wrapped around the tissue, causingLook For SymmetryMalformations tend to be symmetric because they&#8217;re genetic, so you would expect it to present on both sides!Disruptions and deformations are typically asymmetric because they&#8217;re due to external factors.Family History.  relatives with similar features in different generations is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance - For instance, the mother may have features of cleft lip, but may not have the cleft palate itself.Patterns of Malformation Syndrome = a pattern of malformations that a due to the same cause. This isn&#8217;t necessary genetic, it just refers to multiple features due to a single cause (one non-genetic example is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome).Sequence = Here we have a primary malformation, leading to secondary structural changes related to this. - One example is Pierre-Robin sequence: - Problem affecting bone growth resulting in a small chin (Micrognathia). The tongue develops within the chin, so if the tongue is developing normally, but the chin is pushed up, then the tongue is moved up. - The palate is formed from 3 pieces. If the chin is too small, the tongue is pushed up, the closure of the palate is affected, causing a U-shaped palate. - Not only is the tongue pushed up, but it&#8217;s also pushed backwards, occluding the airway. (Glossoptosis)Determinants of Facial FeaturesYou can think of the construction of the face like the building of a house:Growth of skeleton (scaffolding)Variation in structural and extracellular matrix components (materials)Rate of growth and timing of fusion of facial processes (construction process)1. Abnormal Skeletal GrowthAbnormal closure of sutures Skull growth  intramembranous ossification results in formation of skull bones  sutures are fibrous joints between skull bones  growth of bones occurs perpendicular to suture linesMetopic suture anteriorly, Lambdoid suture posteriorly.Diamond shaped fontanelle where the metopic, coronal, and sagittal suture meet.Another one where the sagittal and lambdoid meet.Craniosynostosis  premature fusion of sutures leads to abnormal skull shape with excessive growth at other sutures - Can&#8217;t grow at one suture, so they&#8217;ll grow from other sutures.Coronosynostosis PICTURE (symmetric)Brachycepthaly + hypertelorism.Sometimes you can see this unilaterally, where only one of the sutures closes abnormally. (picture asymmetric)Sagittal SynostosisWill only be able to grow front to make, will have a very long skull shape.Dolichocephaly.Common in premature infants if we don&#8217;t let them move frequently due to lateral pressure.Lambdois SynostosisCommon due to back to bed policyIncreased risk with torticollis.May have history of intrauterine constraint.2. Abnormal Soft Tissue ComponentsStorage of mucopolysaccharides &#8594; inborn error of metabolism.This causes facial coarsening &#8594; baby looks older and has harsh features.Deficiency of fat (lipodystrophy).Gaunt appearance of cheeks.3. Abnormal Development of the Facial ProcessesAround 7 weeks gestation, the frontonasal process and the medial nasal processes are developing.The two medial nasal processes must merge together, and we must have apoptosis so that the other cells can fuse together.If thes medial nasal processes don&#8217;t properly merge, the frontal nasal process may persist.Improper timing of different developmental procedures.Severe hypertelorism &#8594; the eyes are far apart.Binose?Frontonasal dysplasia.HoloprosencephalyFailed forebrain (prosencephalon) division.Affecting separation of the left and right brain leads to a sequence, resulting in aplasia of midline structures.This causes a complete loss of midline structures, resulting in hypotelorism, severely deficient nose, and midline cleft lip.CLEFT LIP Cleft Lip vs Cleft Palate. Paramedial Cleft lip often associated with cleft palate extending from cleft lip posteriorly.LISTEN TO THIS &#8594; paramedial vs bilateral cleft lip.What is the recurrence risk of cleft lip &amp; palate? - Depends on etiology.  polygenic, multifactorial  chromosomal – eg. Trisomy 13  single gene – eg van der Woude syndromeISOLATED CLEFT LIP. ￼ Usually on the left side  Males &gt; females  Unilateral more frequent than bilateral  Asian/First Nations &#8594; set of genes that are more common in that population.Recurrence risk is only 3-4%Increased recurrence risk if proband is female or cleft is bilateral - If we have a polygenic multifactorial condition where one sex is more, there must have been more factors that came together from that sex chromosome, so the recurrence risk is higher, so it&#8217;ll be more riskyCHROMOSOMAL CAUSES, EG TRISOMY 13.  Look for malformations of other organs  Recurrence risk depends on whether due to nondisjunction (RR about 1%) or due to balanced translocation in parent (risk may be significantly increased for miscarriage as well as stillbirth or multiple anomalies due to an unbalanced karyotype in fetus)SINGLE GENE CAUSES, eg VEN DER WOUDE SYNDROMEVery rare.Little dimples in lower lip, with little pinhole &#8594; accessory salivary gland. Will actually have saliva coming from lower lip.Clue to diagnosis.Premaxilla forms in the midline. ￼Autosomal dominant with 50% risk of transmitting mutant allele, 20 % penetrance for cleft lipCLEFT PALATE HAS A DIFFERENT EMBRYOLOGICAL ORIGIN FROM CLEFT LIP AND PALATEIf you just have cleft palate, it&#8217;s different from having cleft lip + palate.Genetic predisposition to a wider face increases your risk for a cleft lip and palate because the cells just have to travel farther for the processes to merge! Primary palate: formed by merging of the medial nasal prominences  Secondary (posterior) palate: formed by fusion of the lateral palatine processes.Closure happens from the front to the back.If you don&#8217;t close the lateral palantine processes, you&#8217;ll end up with a cleft of the secondary palate at the back.This is why the shape of the palate may differ with a cleft-lip + palate vs a cleft palate itself. failure of lateral palatine processes to fuse with each other  bifid uvula or submucous cleft palate represent minor manifestations  etiologically distinct from cleft lip 22q microdeletion  Stickler syndrome 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches.Parathyroid glands.Development of the aortic arch.22q The most common cause of DiGeorge syndrome, a developmental field defect  Primary involvement of third and fourth pharyngeal pouches and other neural crest cell derivatives - Cleft palate, heart abnormalities, congenital thymic aplasia.Stickler syndrome - Development of the first and second branchial arches.  High myopia  Pierre-Robin sequence  Hearing impairment", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/20/genetics-craniofacial-abnormalities.html"},

	{"title": "Blood Gas Analysis", "text": "Blood Gas Interpretation DiagramSee Interpretation FlowchartLecture ObjectivesUnderstand the physiologic basis of ABG analysis.Be able to interpret common ABG abnormalities.Introduction to Blood GasesSome labs report the total CO2 or tCO2 instead of the HCO3. The total is the combination of HCO3 and dissolved CO2, which is quite trivial, so these values are usually very close to one another and can be used interchangeably.Terms in an Arterial Blood GaspH &#8594; measured.PaCO2 &#8594; measured.HCO3- &#8594; calculated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.PaO2 &#8594; measured.SaO2 &#8594; calculated from the Oxyhemoglobin curve.InformationAn ABG tells you two discrete things:OxygenationAcid Base StatusNormal Parameter RangesThe normal parameter ranges for an arterial blood gas are:ParameterValueNormal RangepH7.407.38-7.42PaCO24038-42HCO3-2422-26PaO280-100The normal lower limit for your PaO2 depends on your age.The older you are, the lower we accept!One good ballpark estimate is:&#60; 40 we accept a value of 85 mmHg.40-65 we accept a value of 80 mmHg.&#62; 65 we accept a value of 70 mmHg.Interpreting OxygenationMechanisms of HypoxemiaWe generally don&#8217;t care about hyperoxemia &#8594; that won&#8217;t put the patient in danger.So when we&#8217;re looking at an ABG, we&#8217;re usually trying to determine why the patient in hypoxemic.Hypoxia = low oxygen in tissues.Hypoxemia = low oxygen in blood.We usually refer to shunt separately from V/Q Mismatch. This is because we generally treat the two ends of the V/Q spectrum - shunt and alveolar dead space, as distinct entities.Broadly speaking, there are 4 possible causes of hypoxemia:&#8595;FiO2/PiO2 &#8594; for instance, in patients in high altitude.Hypoventilation.Shunt.V/Q Mismatch.The first cause is typically not applicable clinically &#8594; you won&#8217;t be at elevation!This means that we only need to differentiate between the latter three usually.To differentiate between these, we use the alveolar gas equation, in order to determine the A-a gradient.If the patient is hypoxemic and the gradient is high, then this is more likely to be due to V/Q mismatch.If the patient is hypoxemic and the gradient is low, then this is more likely to be due to hypoventilation.So the A-a gradient lets us determine whether hypoxemia is due to a gas exchange problem or due to reduced ventilation.The Alveolar Gas Equation$$ P_AO_2 = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}$$At sea level, breathing room air, \(P_IO_2 - 150\).That&#8217;s because \( 0.21 \times (760 - 47) \approx 150 \).In practice, \(P_IO_2 - 150\) will be higher, because the patients will be on supplemental oxygen, so the fractional composition of oxygen will be higher.Normal GradientsWe are given the PaO2 from our blood gas.So we simply subtract that from the PAO2 that we obtained from the alveolar gas equation to obtain our A-a gradient.Some hard-and-fast rules for a normal A-a gradient value are:&#60; 1/4 your age.&#60; 12 in young, non-smokers.&#60; 20 in elderly, smokers.This is not an exact science &#8594; what defines a normal A-a gradient isn&#8217;t compeletely set in stone.Interpretation of Hypoxemia from the GradientIf there&#8217;s shunt or V/Q mismatch, gas exchange across the alveolar wall should be affected, causing an increased A-a gradient.If there&#8217;s reduced fractional oxygen, or hypoventilation, there&#8217;s less minute ventilation of oxygen, but gas exchange is normal. This means that we have a normal A-a gradient.To further differentiate these, we give the patient supplemental oxygen:This is because your PAO2 will not improve with shunt (because if there&#8217;s no ventilation in perfused areas, increased oxygen won&#8217;t help at all).However, in other cases, such as with hypoxemia or a V/Q mismatch, you would expect your PAO2 to improve.In summary:Interpretation of HypoxemiaCause of HypoxemiaGradientEffect of &#8593; FIO2&#8595;FIO2/PIO2N&#8593; PO2HypoventilationN&#8593; PO2Shunt&#8593;&#8596; PO2V/Q Mismatch&#8593;&#8593; PO2Interpreting Acid-Base StatusThe idea here is that any acid-base disturbance is caused by one of two things:A primary respiratory disorderHyperventilation to reduce the PCO2 &#8594; respiratory alkalosis.Hypoventilation to increase the PCO2 &#8594; respiratory acidosis.A primary metabolic disorderMetabolic acidosis.Metabolic alkalosis.So with acid-base status, there is always a primary problem.In response, the other system will have compensation to try to normalize the acid-base status.For instance, respiratory acidosis will cause a compensatory metabolic alkalosis.RememberThere&#8217;s a primary problem and a compensatory response.How do we know which one is the primary problem?How do we differentiate between the primary problem and the compensatory response?We use the fact that the body never overcompensates.So the compensatory response will only partially neutralize the primary problem!For instance, if the patient is acidotic, and there is a increase in the PaCO2 causing an alkalosis, we know that this must be the compensatory mechanism because the body is still acidotic!RememberThe body never overcompensates, so the compensatory response will be the one that&#8217;s insufficient in reversing the global state.The lungs mediate the respiratory compensation by hyperventilating or hypoventilating.The kidneys mediate the metabolic compensation by retaining or excreting bicarbonate.However, the lungs compensate quickly &#8594; it&#8217;s faster to change the breathing rate than it is to change filtration!RememberRespiratory compensation occurs much faster than metabolic compensation.This means that the degree of compensation varies depending on the primary disorder.A compensatory respiratory response is generally more robust than a compensatory metabolic response, because hyper/hypoventilation is easier.For instance, there will be a 1:1 correspondence in PCO2 and HCO3- with metabolic acidosis, since the compensatory respiratory alkalosis (breathing faster) is easy to do.Metabolic compensation will have both an acute and chronic response. The chronic response is where acid/base loss is regulated in the kidney.The response ratios are listed below, but for the rationale, check out the Acid-Base Physiology lecture from the Nephro block.Summary of Compensatory ResponsesMetabolic Acidosis &#8594; 10:10 ratio.Metabolic Alkalosis &#8594; 10:7 ratio.Respiratory AcidosisAcute &#8594; 10:1 ratio.Chronic &#8594; 10:4 ratio.Respiratory AlkalosisAcute &#8594; 10:2 ratio.Chronic &#8594; 10:4 ratio.Case ExamplesSteps for ABG Analysis of Acid-Base StatusIs there a primary acidosis or alkalosis?Primary disorder respiratory or metabolic?Is the respiratory disorder acute or chronic?For metabolic acidosis, what is anion gap?Will not see this today, but will in Nephrology, here.Are there other metabolic disorders present?Is the respiratory system compensating appropriately for a metabolic disturbance?1. Case 1There is primary acidosis.This is respiratory acidosis &#8594; the bicarbonate is near the normal range, but the PCO2 is sharply elevated.There is compensatory metabolic alkalosis &#8594; a slight increase in bicarbonate.There is a 34 mmHg increase from the normal PCO2 of 40 mmHg, so you would expect a 10:1 ratio for the acute compensatory response (with compensatory metabolic alkalosis).So there should be an increase of 3.4 for the HCO3, which we do see, as it&#8217;s normally around 24.Since there&#8217;s a 10:1 ratio, this is acute respiratory acidosis.2. Case 2This is primary alkalosis.This is respiratory alkalosis, because the PCO2 is the one that sharply dropped.There is compensatory metabolic acidosis, seen with a decrease in the bicarbonate.If this was acute, you would expect a 10:2 ratio for the response.Since the PCO2 dropped by 20 (normal is 40), you would expect the HCO3 to have dropped by 4.This is what we see, the HCO3 went from 24 &#8594; 20.So this is acute respiratory alkalosis.The A-a gradient is 35, suggestive of shunt or V/Q mismatch.However, the patient is not hypoxemic because the patient is hyperventilating.These would be classic gases for a patient with an acute pulmonary embolism &#8594; always check the A-a gradient!RememberHyperventilation &#60; 25 mmHg.Hypoventilation &#62; 45 mmHg.3. Case 3Note &#8594; the HCO3 should be 26 meq/L.This is primary acidosis.Respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.We would expect to see a 10:1 ratio for the acute response to respiratory acidosis.Since the PCO2 increased by 12, you would expect the HCO3 to rise by 1.2.It rose by 2. So this would agree with an acute response.So this is acute respiratory acidosis.NoteBoth Case 1 and Case 3 have acute respiratory acidosis, but their etiology is completely different!Don&#8217;t forget to look at their oxygenation status!What is their A-a gradient?Patient 1For Patient 1, the PAO2 is 150 - (74 &#215; 1.25) = 150 - 92.5 = 57.5So the A-a Gradient = 57.5 - 50 = 7.5 mmHg.This is suggestive of hypoventilation.Patient 3PAO2 = 150 - (52 &#215; 1.25) = 150 - 65 = 85.So the A-a Gradient = 85 - 46 = 39 mmHg.This is suggestive of V/Q mismatch or shunt.4. Case 4This is primary acidosis.Respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.The rise in the PCO2 is 34.The compensatory rise in the HCO3 is 8.This is suggestive of a chronic compensation &#8594; closer to a 10:4 ratio, than a 10:1 ratio.So this is chronic respiratory acidosis.The A-a gradient is 150 - (74 &#215; 1.25) - 50 = 7.5, which is normal.5. Case 5Primary acidosis.In this case, since the PCO2 has fallen, which would cause alkalosis, it must be a metabolic acidosis with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.The HCO3 has dropped by 11, so using our 10:7 ratio, you should expect to see a drop of around 8 for the PCO2.This is pretty accurate &#8594; it drops by 12.In summary, this is metabolic acidosis.The A-a gradient is 150 - (28 &#215; 1.25) - 98 = 17.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/19/blood-gas-analysis.html"},
	{"title": "Respirology Small Group Cases 11-14", "text": "Case 11Snoring and Excessive Daytime SleepinessA 33 year old man presents with the complaint of daytime sleepiness. He complains of repeated awakening, and poor quality sleep. Anytime he is unoccupied for more than a few minutes or sitting watching televison he tends to doze off. He has dozed off while driving and avoids driving long distances alone.His wife says he is a loud snorer which is worse in the past few years as he has gained weight and she says he stops breathing during the night repeatedly. They are now sleeping in separate rooms. He has a history of hypertension and he drinks several bottles of beer each night.Physical examinationHe weighs 104 kg, his height is 1.79 m and his body mass index is 32.5 kg/m2. He has a neck circumference of 45 cm. There is no nasal obstruction. He has a large uvula and soft palate with tonsillar enlargement and a crowded posterior oropharynx. The chest and cardiovascular examination is normal (that is, normal JVP and no peripheral edema).1. What is the most likely diagnosis? List 3 common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.The most likely diagnosis is obstructive sleep apnea (classical risk factors for OSA, such as obesity, and a crowded oropharynx).The most common cause of excessive daytime sleepiness is insufficient sleep (eg. in medical students!).In cases where there is sufficient sleep, sleepiness can be caused by conditions that fragment sleep &#8594; OSA, periodic limb movement disorders.Narcolepsy is where you fall asleep due to excessive daytime sleepiness.2. What diagnostic test(s) is (are) needed to make the diagnosis? What is this test likely to show in this man?Overnight polysomnography.Typically the diagnostic threshold is &#62; 10 apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep.3. What are the important consequences or complications of this diagnosis?OSA can fragment sleep and result in hypoxemia and hypercapnia.Causes excessive daytime sleepiness and impaired daytime performance.Also an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension, arrythmias, and death from congestive heart failure (recall Heart &#38; Circulation).Decreased libido and impotence can also occur in up to 28% of men with OSA.Polycythemia can occur to compensate for reduced oxygenation.4. What are the general treatment measures for this condition?Increase the size of the upper airway (surgery, eg. tonsillectomy).Decrease upper airway collapsibility (eg. weight loss).General measures include weight loss, avoidance of alcohol, smoking cessation, and reduction of obstruction.5. What are the specific treatment measures for this condition?CPAP (first line) or upper airway surgery.Palatal Surgery &#8594; uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP).Uvula, soft palate, tonsils, and redundant pharyngeal tissue is removed.Works in around 50% of patients with OSA, but may also worsen apnea.Oral appliances may also be used to advance the mandible to reduce obstruction during sleep.Case 12An asymptomatic woman with a solitary pulmonary nodule on a routine CXRA 61 year old man had an asymptomatic left lung lesion noted on a routine CXR. He is a 60 pack-year smoker. He tells you a CXR and tuberculin skin test were recently performed in anticipation of a new job. The tuberculin skin test was positive. He has no other medical problems.Physical examinationUnremarkable.CXRA well circumscribed noncalcified solitary nodule (~2 cm in diameter) is visualized in the left upper lobe.1. List the most common etiologies of a solitary pulmonary nodule.Common etiologies of a solitary pulmonary nodule include:Carcinoma &#8594; (primary or metastatic)Granuloma &#8594; due to tuberculosis or fungal infectionHamartoma &#8594; benign, focal malformation. Grow at the same rate as surrounding tissue.The major diagnostic consideration is to separate malignant from benign lesions.2. Describe at least two radiographic criteria useful in discriminating a benign from malignant nodule. Some examples include:Solid or laminated calcificationCXR stability for 2 yearsSharp margins in a patient under 30 years of age, with a positive TB test.3. Describe at least two clinical criteria useful in discriminating a benign from a malignant nodule.Age &#38; smoking history. Most solitary pulmonary nodules in older patients are malignant.History of previous malignancy &#8594; increased likelihood of metastases.Geographic location of the patient &#8594; more likely to be histoplasmosis or coccidiodomycosis in endemic areas.4. A previous CXR is not available. What do you recommend?Patient is older, with a history of smoking, and presents with a new solitary pulmonary nodule, so this is suspicious.Even with the positive TB test, we don&#8217;t have enough info to rule out a malignant lesion.Would do a CT scan of the thorax to look for other nodules (to determine if it&#8217;s a metastatic growth).Can also do a biopsy &#8594; transbronchial biopsy (or an open biopsy, depending on the location), to obtain sufficient tissue for diagnosis.5. Cytology is positive for adenocarcinoma. Routine blood tests are normal. Pulmonary function tests are normal. What is your suggested treatment?Surgery &#8594; typically a lobectomy.Case 13Fever and purulent sputum in a woman with diabetes mellitusA 35 year old woman, with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, presents with a 24 hour history of high fever, shaking chills, a cough productive of a small amount of sputum, and left pleuritic chest pain.Physical ExaminationThe patient looks ill and has a temperature of 40&#176; C. Pulse rate is 120/minute. Blood pressure 100/60 mmHg supine and 80/50 mmHg sitting up. Respiratory rate is 25/minute. There is dullness to percussion, increased fremitus, bronchial breath sounds, and inspiratory crackles over the LUL.Sputum ExaminationSputum examination reveals numerous pus cells with gram positive diplococci.1. What is your clinical diagnosis? i.e. where was it acquired, what kind of host?Community Acquired Pneumonia &#8594; Strep pneuomoniae.This would be classiied as a typical pneumonia (purulent sputum, S. pneumoniae, abrupt onset, etc.)The patient has comorbidities, so this would be a complicated host.2. What further initial investigations would you perform?Blood Work &#8594; CBC, blood culture, renal function.Chest X-ray &#8594; should see a lobar infiltrate, in the LUL.Since this is an air-space filling process, we should see air bronchograms as well.3. Discuss the significance of the physical findings and describe the &#8220;expected&#8221; CXR.Dullness to percussion suggests alveolar consolidation, possibly due to edema.Crackes are further suggestive of pulmonary edema.Bronchial breath sounds (breath sounds heard over the bronchi) are suggestive of consolidation.4. What is your initial treatment of this patient.As a patient with comorbidities, the first line of treatment for a CAP would be a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, etc).5. Describe three potential complications of this condition?Potential complications of pneumococcal pneumonia include:MeningitisEndocarditisSeptic arthritisEmpyema formationLung abscess formationAcute respiratory failureCase 14Cough and fever in a transplant patientA 54 year old woman recently had a renal transplant for chronic glomerulonephritis. While recovering in hospital she develops a cough productive of small amounts of purulent sputum, fever, rigors and shortness of breath.Physical ExaminationThe patient looks ill and in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 30/min. Pulse rate is 120/minute. Auscultation demonstrates inspiratory crackles over the left postero-lateral lung field. The abdominal incision is healing well.CXRLocalized alveolar infiltrates are present in the left lower lobe.CBCWBC is elevated at 21,000/mL.1. What is your clinical diagnosis?Pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient.Since patients with transplants must be on immunosuppression.2. What tests you would order? Justify the ordering of these tests.Bronchoscopy with a lavage to obtain a sputum biopsy.Normally these are not done, but in an immunocompromised host, the range of possible infectious causes is wider, so we need a better sample.Multiple cultures would also be done to try and obtain a sufficient sample for diagnosis.3. What initial therapy would you recommend?You would try to use broad spectrum antibiotics, as well as antifungals in case it&#8217;s a Candida/Aspergillus infection.To get good gram positive coverage with good gram negative coverage, you could use a first generation cephalosporin (Cefazolin) plus an aminoglycoside (Tobramycin, Gentimicin).4. List three predisposing risk factors for the development of hospital-acquired pneumonia, in any patient.Predisposing risk factors associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia include:IntubationIntensive care unitAntibiotic useRecent surgeryChronic cardiopulmonary diseaseImmunosuppressionAdvanced age", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/19/respiratory-medicine-small-group.html"},

	{"title": "Respiratory Neoplastic Diseases", "text": "Clinical Aspects of Lung CancerEpidemiology of Lung CancerMore deaths than colorectal, cervical and breast cancer combined.The risk persists for years after smoking cessation, although it does decrease asymptotically.21,700 new cases per year, and 18,900 deaths per yearIt is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in CanadaAt the present time, there is no role for screeningYou&#8217;d think it&#8217;d be an obvious candidate for screening, considering how common and lethal it is.However, the problem is that until recently, trials have not shown a mortality benefit in doing so.One recent study showed a small benefit with annual CTs, so this has become popular in the US. However, the exorbitant cost prevents it from being done in Canada.Cancer Incidence and Death for MalesFor males, prostate cancer is the most common, followed by lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.However, with respect to deaths, lung cancer is by far the largest cause.Cancer Incidence and Death for FemalesFor females, breast cancer is the most common, followed by lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.Again, lung cancer is by far the largest cause of death.Epidemiology of Lung CancerThe most common cancers are:Prostate Cancer (male)/ Breast Cancer (female)Lung CancerColorectal Cancer However, lung cancer is the most common cause of death!Etiology of Lung CancerThere are really only two main causes of lung cancer:Smoking &#8594; by far the most common cause of lung cancer!Bad Luck.Other exposures such as radon may also cause lung cancer, but they&#8217;re such minor causes that we don&#8217;t really consider them.Second-hand smoke may play a role, but it&#8217;s almost always due to first-hand smoking!Prognosis of Lung Cancer5 year survivals for breast, colon, and prostate cancer.Looking at 5 year survivals, breast cancer survival has improved a little, colon cancer has improved a little, and prostate cancer survival has improved a lot.However, looking at lung cancer, the survival is very low, and it hasn&#8217;t improved much.We have made very few inroads on improving the prognosis of lung cancer over the past quarter century, even with improved diagnoses, technology, etc.Classification of Lung CancerSmall Cell (SCLC) (15%) &#8594; in a distinct group.Non Small Cell (NSCLC) (75%).Adenocarcinoma.Squamous Cell Carcinoma.Large Cell Carcinoma.Other (10%).Small cell cancers have distinct clinical presentation, pathology, and management.Typically associated with a poorer prognosis.They are usually very bad tumours that are almost always metastatic by the time it presents.Often when we see a SCLC, we assume that it has already metastasized!Non-small cell cancers are typically clinically, radiographically, and therapeutically fairly homogeneous.Clinical Presentation of Lung CancersIt&#8217;s convenient to split the presentation into the following categories:Symptoms related to the primary lesion &#8594; pretty non-specific.Cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis.Chest pain, weight loss.Hemoptysis is usually the symptom that gets patients to go to the doctor, but it&#8217;s actually most commonly caused by chronic bronchitis.Unexplained weight loss is typically the most alarming sign, and is most suggestive of a malignancy.Symptoms related to intrathoracic spread &#8594; these are all poor prognostic signs! If we can&#8217;t surgically remove the cancer, then it&#8217;s typically incurable.Pleural effusion.Pericardial effusion.Hoarseness &#8594; due to pressure on the recurrent laryngeal nerve.SVC syndrome &#8594; impingement of the SVC that may cause occlusion, impairing venous return. This causes swelling of the head, neck, and limbs.Symptoms related to distant metastasis &#8594; the 4 big places that lung cancer metastasizes to are:Bone &#8594; often causes bone pain.Brain &#8594; often causes seizures and headache.AdrenalsLiverAdrenal and liver metastasis often don&#8217;t present with symptoms.Paraneoplastic syndromes &#8594; we don&#8217;t really know what causes them, but we speculate that they&#8217;re due to excess hormone production by the tumour.Hypercalcemia.Digital clubbing.Ectopic production of hormones.Neurologic disease.The presence of paraneoplastic syndromes does not mean that the patient has a metastatic disease!Paraneoplastic syndromes are caused by indirect factors, which can affect regions that aren&#8217;t proximal to the tumour.For instance, neurologic disease caused by a paraneoplastic syndrome does not mean that the tumour has metastasized to the brain &#8594; instead, it&#8217;s probably due to factors released by the tumour that have gotten to the brain!AsideChronic Bronchitis is the most common cause of hemoptysis in Canada (TB is the most common cause worldwide).Remember:The 4 big places that lung cancer metastasizes to are:BoneBrainLiverAdrenalsThis can be memorized with the BLAB acronym &#8594; Bone, Liver, Adrenals, Brain.Diagnostic InvestigationsRadiology &#8594; the CXR or an incidental CT finding are almost always where we first consider lung cancer in our DDx.Sputum cytologyNot too useful a diagnostic test, because it&#8217;s not very sensitive.So if you have a suspicious CXR and a negative sputum cytology, it wouldn&#8217;t reassure you that the patient doesn&#8217;t have lung cancer!And even if the cytology is positive, we would stil need further investigations to characterize the tumour (bronchoscopy, FNAB, etc).So neither a postive nor a negative test is very useful in a diagnostic workup!Pleural fluid cytology (pleurocentesis) &#8594; useful because it can both diagnose and stage a patient with lung cancer.Bronchoscopy &#8594; done to ensure there are no other tumours within the bronchial tree.MediastinoscopyThis involves examination of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum.Used to determine the progression of the tumour. (typically it&#8217;ll progress from the primary tumour in lung &#8594; hilar lymph nodes &#8594; mediastinal lymph nodes &#8594; distal metastases).Percutaneous core needle aspiration biopsy.Bronchoscopy vs FNABBronchoscopy, and transbronchial biopsies, can usually only access the inner two thirds of the thorax.A FNAB can access the outer one-third of the thorax.RememberBronchoscopy is used if the tumour is in the inner 2/3 of the lung.FNAB is used if the tumour is in the outer 1/3 of the lung.Staging of TumoursRecall that the typical lung cancer progresses from primary tumour &rarr; hilar lymph nodes &rarr; mediastinal lymph nodes &rarr; distant metastasesTNM Staging (Tumour, Nodes, Mets) is used:Primary Tumour (T) &#8594; how big is the primary tumour? Where is it located?Regional Lymph Nodes (N) &#8594; Mediastinal lymph node involvement, Hilar lymph node involvement, etc. Mediastinal LN involvement has a poorer prognosis.Distant Metastases (M) &#8594; whether the tumour has metastasized or not.Hilar LN involvement is relatively unimportant compared to mediastinal LN involvement with TNM staging for lung cancer, because of how lung tumours generally spread.From best prognosis to worst prognosis, it would be hilar lymph nodes &#62; mediastinal lymph nodes &#62; metastases.As a general rule of thumb, if they just have the primary tumour, or the primary tumour + hilar lymph node involvement, the tumour will be surgically resectable.If they have mediastinal involvement, or distant metastases, then it typically won&#8217;t be surgically resectable.Recall that the bone, brain, liver, and adrenals, are the 4 most common regions of lung cancer metastases!CT scans of the brain, chest and upper abdomen are typically done, to catch metastases, and to determine the nature of the primary tumour.The upper abdomen scan gives you coverage of the liver and adrenals!PET Scans are used to detect metabolically active tissue (suggestive of metastases), in patients that are considered for surgery - This is to make sure we didn&#8217;t miss any metastases that would prevent the tumour from being surgically resectable.RememberPrimary Tumour or the Primary Tumour + Hilar LNs &#8594; surgically resectable.Mediastinal LN or metastases &#8594; not surgically resectable.Treatment of Lung CancerNon Small Cell:Surgery is best choice.Chemotherapy: slightly prolongs life. Rarely cures the disease, but does extend life and improves quality of life.Radiotherapy: palliative, useful for bone and brain mets, causing complications. as well as intrathoracic complicationsSmall Cell: &#8594; recall that this is virtually always metastatic at presentation.Surgery is rare because it&#8217;s almost always metastatic!Chemotherapy: prolongs life. Without therapy, prognosis is only 3 months. With therapy, this extends to 9 months.Radiotherapy: palliative.RememberSurgery is the only curative choice for lung cancer.For SCLCs, surgery is rare because it almost always has metastasized at presentation!For NSCLCs, surgery can be done if the tumour hasn&#8217;t progressed to the mediastinal lymph nodes.Chemotherapy is not curative, put extends life and improves quality of life.Radiotherapy is palliative, especially for bone and brain mets.Surgical Treatment of Lung CancerWedge Resection &#8594; not done that frequently because the recurrence rate is much higher.Lobectomy &#8594; by far the most common operation.Pneumonectomy &#8594; done if the tumour crosses the fissures of the lungs. Higher risk, so not done unless it has to be.RememberA lobectomy is the most common surgical operation when dealing with lung cancer.The expected drop off in patients with lung cancer. Around 2/3 of patients will be untreatable because they will have already have a metastatic cancer on presentation. Another 10% will show positive mediastinal lymph nodes, which is also non surgically resectable Even for the remaining patients, surgical treatment still isn&#39;t a strong guarantee of survival.The best possible presentation of a lung cancer is a solitary pulmonary nodule.These are often found incidentally with no evidence of metastatic disease.Patients like this would get a lobectomy for their solitary nodule, and have a pretty good (65%) 5-year survival.Pathology of Lung CancerThe WHO Histologic ClassificationIn order by decreasing incidence, lung cancers are classified as:Adenocarcinomas (31%)Squamous Cell Carcinomas (30%)Small Cell Carcinomas (18%)Large Cell Carcinomas (9%)Combined Carcinoma (2%)Adenosquamous Carcinoma.Small cell + adenocarcinoma.Carcinoid tumour (4%)Metastatic carcinoma.Cancers that are in bold are types of non-small cell lung cancers.Adenocarcinomas are now the most common type of lung cancer, over squamous cell carcinomas, perhaps due to a decrease in smoking.The simple classification is SCLC and NSCLC, as discussed previously:Classification of Lung CancerSmall Cell (SCLC) (15%) &#8594; in a distinct group.Non Small Cell (NSCLC) (75%).Adenocarcinoma.Squamous Cell Carcinoma.Large Cell Carcinoma.Other (10%).The 3 most common types of lung cancersIn order, the 3 most common types of lung cancer are:Adenocarcinoma.Squamous Cell Carcinoma.Small Cell Carcinoma.Anatomic ClassificationCentral vs. Peripheral.Central = inner 2/3, use bronchoscopy.Peripheral = outer 1/3, use FNAB.Adenocarcinomas are typically peripheral, which makes them slower to metastasize, which is associated with better outcomes.Small cell carcinomas are usually central, and very aggressive, which makes prognoses generally very poor.Squamous cell carcinomas are also typically central, but may be seen in the periphery as well.Diagnosis and Physical for Lung CancerHistory and Physical.Radiology &#8594; CXR and CT.Tissue diagnosis it the gold standard &#8594; there is still a role for pathologists in the diagnosis of lung cancer.Pathologists also play a role in staging a cancer &#8594; this is referred to as pTMN staging (the p is for Pathology).Squamous Cell CarcinomaSquamous cell carcinoma evolves in a very stepwise, logical fashion:The first response to irritants such as smoking is basal cell hyperplasia, to protect the columnar cells.These basal cells then convert to squamous cells &#8594; squamous metaplasia. At this point in time this is still reversible.If it continues, these cells become dysplastic &#8594; squamous dysplasia.When these dysplastic cells involve the entire thickness of the mucosa, but have not pierced the basement membrane, then we have squamous carcinoma in situ. These patients will usually still be asymptomatic.When the cancer gets past the basement membrane, then we have an invasive carcinoma. It&#8217;s usually only now when they will begin to present with symptoms.Gross Pathology of Squamous Cell CarcinomasHere is an image of a squamous cell carcinoma seen post-lobectomy.Appears as a firm tan central tumour in the bronchus, with an irregular border.May be obstructive (wheezing, dyspnea, possible hemoptysis).With larger tumours, there may be cavitation due to central necrosis.Histology of Squamous Cell CarcinomasHistologically, squamous cell carcinomas are seen as keratinizing malignant squamous cells.Malignancy is determined by nuclear features &#8594; irregularity, hyperchromaticity of the nucleaus.AdenocarcinomaAs mentioned before, these are usually in peripheral regions of the lung.As a result of their peripheral location, pleural involvement is more common with adenocarcinomas.These are the lung cancers that non-smokers get.Will canonically present as a solitary pulmonary nodule.Since it&#8217;s often associated with a scar, adenocarcinomas are often also known as scar carcinomas.An adenocarcinoma can arise from atypical adenomatous hyperplasia.Gross Pathology of AdenocarcinomasHere is an image of an adenocarcinoma post lobectomy.Irregularly shaped, firm, tan coloured.It has also involved the pleura &#8594; seen as pleural puckering.This irregularity is characteristic of a neoplastic condition.Bronchioalveolar Carcinoma (BAC)This is a subtype of adenocarcinoma, that is increasing in incidence.This is least associated with cigarette smoking.Thought to be an in situ type of adenocarcinoma.Can appear as a solitary nodule, multiple nodules, bilateral, or consolidation (that looks like pneumonia).Good prognosis &#8594; if it&#8217;s localized and &#60;2 cm, there&#8217;s a close to 100% 5-year-survival.Neuroendocrine Tumours of the LungThese include small cell carcinomas, which as we said before generally has a high grade and poor prognosis.Other types include typical carcinoid and atypical carcinoid tumours, which have better prognoses.So generally, these can be split into carcinoid tumours, or small cell carcinomas.These arise from neuroendocrine cells, embedded in the respiratory epithelium.Triggers, such as smoking (in small cell carcinomas), turn on these neuroendocrine cells.They then either become a carcinoid tumour or a small cell carcinoma.Carcinoid Tumours vs Small Cell Carcinomas        	Carcinoid Tumours    	Small Cell Carcinomas            	1-2% of Lung Cancers.    	20-25% of Lung Cancers.            	Young people (&lt; 40).    	Older people (40-70).            	Non-smokers.    	Smokers.            	Low grade, good prognosis.    	High grade, poor prognosis.            	Surgery &rarr; curative goals.    	Chemo/radiation &rarr; palliative goals.    The commonality between carcinoid tumours and small cell carcinomas is that they both share neuroendocrine features.Why are Small Cell Carcinomas called small?Because the cells are rapidly dividing and look small under the microscope!This gives them a distinct histological appearance.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/18/clinical-aspects-pathology-respiratory-neoplasms.html"},

This results in a thrombus.The clot can break off and embolize to the lungs, occluding one or more blood vessels.Predisposing FactorsThe big factors are ones relating to Virchow&#8217;s Triad.Co-existing or previous phlebitis may also affect the structure of vessels leading to the lung.Pregnancy can increase risk of clotting due to differing hormonal status.

Chest X-RayChest X-Ray &#8594; most common diagnostic test.Effusions are typically only seen when the pleural fluid &#62;300 mL.Blunting of costophrenic angle(s) followed by the meniscus.Costophrenic Angle &#8594; angle at which the diaphragm and chest meet. This can be seen on the right.You should also see that the fluid will move to dependent areas, when laid down on the lateral decubitus position. Take this patient, rotate them 90 degrees. The fluid moves to the dependent areas! You can see that the fluid runs along the side now.This is a lateral decubitus X-Ray. We always do this, because we need to ensure that the fluid is freely moving with a pleural effusion.Bilateral pleural effusion.UltrasoundCT ScanThoracentesisSample that fluid.Not always diagnostic, but can help rule things in/out.TABLE HERELDH, protein, albumin, should be in blood.

	{"title": "Sleep Disordered Breathing", "text": "Lecture OverviewCauses of HypoventilationOverview of Normal Sleep Physiology &amp; its interaction with breathing2 CasesHypoventilationRecall that hypventilation is an abnormally high PaCO2 &#8594; &#62;45 mmHg.Associated with hypoxemia via the alveolar gas equation &#8594; PaO2 &#60;80 mmHg.Can be diurnal or noctural.When you sleep, you have a certain degree of physiological hypoventilationWhy do you get Hypoventilation?Reduced Minute Ventilation (VE)For instance, if you halve your ventilation, your CO2 will double.Abnormal breathing pattern (eg. rapid shallow breathing)One example of this is with a broken rib &#8594; you&#8217;ll breathe rapidly but shallowly, and you&#8217;ll mainly only ventilate the dead space. (eg. the highest West Zone).Note that this could seem &#8216;paradoxical&#8217; by a layman&#8217;s definition of hypoventilation, since your breathing rate increases, but ventilation goes down.Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatching &#8594; parenchymal lung disease.In other words, hypoventilation is affected by how deeply you breathe, how rapidly you breathe, and how well your ventilation and perfusion are matched.Chemical Control of BreathingRecall that we have central chemoreceptors and peripheral chemoreceptors that detect changes in pH and oxygen, respectively.The Hypoxic Ventilatory DriveThe hypoxic ventilatory drive is mediated by peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid body and the aortic arch.These receptors are very sensitive to changes in PO2, and triggers an increase in ventilation.Usually a minor regulator of breathing, except in cases of hyperventilation causing chronic hypoxemia. (Recall the Control of Breathing lecture).The Hypercapnic Ventilatory DriveMediated by central chemoreceptors in the medulla.Detects a change in pH due to a change in the PaCO2, and causes an increase in ventilation.As discussed previously, this plays the major role in the regulation of breathing, as a change in arterial pH can affect enzymatic function.The Sleep-Wake CycleSleep is regulated by 2 factors:Homeostatic FactorsHomeostatic factors regulate body demands such as thirst and hunger.In this case, they cause increasing pressure for sleep the longer you&#8217;re awake.Circadian FactorsThis causes varying degrees of wakefulness with respect to the 24-hour cycle of the day.Once the Circadian alerting signal falls (with nightfall), then the homeostatic factor can overcome it, triggering sleepiness.The Sleep HypnogramSleep actually occurs in phases, which can be seen above.Ventilatory Drive is State DependentThe hypoxic ventilatory drive and the hypercapnic ventilatory response are attenuated depending on how deeply you are sleeping.In other words, the change in ventilation in response to a change in \(S_aO_2\) or a change in \(P_aCO_2\) is reduced.At the REM phase, this chemical control is markedly reduced.Not all patients have the same degree of chemical response.In some severe cases, the chemoresponse during REM sleep could be virtually zero.In these patients, they would be even less responsive to hypoxia/hypercapnia during deep sleep.Changes in Breathing during SleepDuring sleep, there are a number of physiological changes:Loss of voluntary control of breathingReduced ventilatory response to oxygen and carbon dioxide leads to hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia.Overall ventilation (VE) reduced 10-15%.Changes in breathing pattern lead to reduced VE.Reduced central input to respiratory and upper airway muscles.In other words, be ventilate less (leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia), and we have reduced muscle tone.Physiological Changes during REM SleepDuring REM sleep, you are more predisposed to rapid &#38; shallow breathing, which increases CO2 and lowers O2.In normal patients, this drop is inconsequential, due to the shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. (Recall that if the oxygen saturation is above 90%, then you should stay around the plateau area)In patients that aren&#8217;t on this plateau level however, we may have substantial drops in saturation.Normally, this would trigger our hypoxic drive to ventilation.But if we have a steeply attenuated chemoresponse, as is seen in some patients during REM sleep, then this may not be enough!This is where problems can occur!Overnight Oximetry in COPDHere is an example of patient with markedly reduced SaO2 levels as seen with overnight oximetry.In a normal patient, the oxygen saturation will be around 95%. Here it&#8217;s markedly lower, particularly during REM sleep.This is caused by normal changes in physiology which are exaggerated in an abnormal host.Case 1Case Summary26 y/o male chemical engineer.Presenting illness: respiratory failure.April 93: &#8216;cold&#8217; x 3/52Cough, yellow sputum.Difficulty sleeping.Treating with Amoxil.May 93: CXR - bilateral pneumonia.Antibiotic changed to Keflex (1st gen cephalosporin).No improvement with Keflex.Admitted to Leamington Hospital.Transferred to the Windsor ICU.Not intubated (PaO2 = 56, PaCO2 = 68)Resolved with IV antibiotics.August 93, starts to notice:Swelling of ankles.Dyspnea when supine.Decreased exercise capacity.Physical ExamShort stature, 1.56 m, 59 kg, BMI = 21.6.BP 130/78, HR 114, RR 26.Bilateral Basal Crackles.Elevated JVP, S3.Palpable liver edge.Bilateral edema to the knees.Pulmonary Function TestsFEV1 = 1.52 (37%)FVC = 1.65 (40%)FEV1/FVC = 93%TLC = 2.61 (46%), KCO = 5.75 (103%)MIP = 31 cm H2O (24%)MEP = 59 cm H2O (32%)PO2 = 56, PCO2 = 68, pH = 7.43, HCO3 = 38.Not a smoker, no previous lung disease before the pneumonia.FEV1 and FVC are low, but the ratio is high. In an obstructive lung disease, the ratio should be lower (recall that 0.8 was normal, less than that was abnormal).So this isn&#8217;t an obstructive lung disease, and is more likely to be a restrictive lung disease.There are signs of biventricular failure:S3 and bilateral basal crackles (suggestive of pulmonary edema) are a sign of LV failure.Elevated JVP, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema are signs of RV failure.Normal PCO2 is 40, although we usually accept up to 45. So a PCO2 of 68 is extremely abnormal.MIP = maximal inspiratory pressure = how hard you suck on inspiration.MEP = maximal expiratory pressure = how hard you blow on expiration.Since his MIP and MEP are markedly reduced, it&#8217;s suggestive of a weakened respiratory muscles affecting his ability to ventilate.He had a condition causing muscle weakness.This caused Nocturnal HypoventilationNocturnal hypoventilation causes fatigue, and hypersomnolence.Hypoxic vasoconstriction can also lead to pulmonary hypertension, causing Cor Pulmonale!The patient&#39;s oxygen saturation curve overnight.This is dramatic!At the beginning, he&#8217;s just at 90% &#8594; right at the bend of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.During sleep, he never goes back to a normal saturation.There&#8217;s a profound degree of desaturation, especially at the REM phases.Even deoxygenated blood returning to the blood in a normal patient is around 80%!So in this patient&#8217;s case, his &#8216;oxygenated&#8217; blood is less oxygenated than a normal patient&#8217;s deoxygenated blood!RIBCAGE reflects respiratory effort assessed by movement/expansion of the chest.We note that this line basically stops with sleep. This isn&#8217;t unusual during REM sleep, where we mainly depend on our diaphragm to breathe.REM sleep is a phase characterized by muscle atonia.However, note that the CO2 is not changing at all either &#8594; the patient is hardly ventilating!Here, once the patient&#8217;s saturation falls significantly, he wakes and increases ventilation, but can&#8217;t restore saturations to normal levels.This causes hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep.Patient Follow UpFigure on the right shows how PACO2 levels and ventilation improve with the use of BIPAP (dots), versus without (triangles).BiPAP = Bilevel Positive Airway PressureCPAP = Continuous Positive Airway PressureBiPAP was used here because the patient effectively wasn&#8217;t breathing at all. Instead of having continuous pressure, with BiPAP, there are two levels of pressure.Can trigger a phase firing with a tiny difference in pressure. This triggers a pressure rise to a specific level.This is effectively assisted breathing.What about during REM sleep, when he&#8217;s not breathing at all basically?Here, we set the BiPAP to fire at a regular interval, to compensate for the fact that the patient&#8217;s respiratory muscles are completely insufficient.Here, the patient&#8217;s blood gases returned to normal after 6 months, and his biventricular failure resolved.A comparison of BiPAP delivering CPAP and BiPAP delivering BiPAP. Note that the pressure with CPAP is constant, and the pressure with BiPAP is oscillatory, and bilevel.Significant improvements in ventilation during REM sleep. Note that ribcage movement has been maintained during REM sleep.Significant improvements in oxygen saturation were observed. The fluctuation at the beginning was because the BiPAP wasn&#39;t tuned properly.Hypoventilation and Neuromuscular Disease (NMD)        	Area of Lesion    	Example of Illness            	Spinal Cord    	Multiple Sclerosis            	Anterior Horn cells    	Polio, ALS            	Neuromuscular Junction    	Myasthenia Gravis            	Muscle    	Myopathies: eg. Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy.    Any of these can predispose a patient for nocturnal hypoventilation.Could also have skeletal abnormalities of the thoracic cage, which prevents maximal lung opening. This can also cause nocturnal hypoventilation.In other words, anything that restricts breathing could cause exaggerated symptoms upon sleep.Case 2Case Summary49 y/o farmer.Presenting complaints: - Loud snoring, daytime sleepiness (according to his wife)Very loud snoring &#8594; worse with alcohol, on back.Feels rested in AM, but drowsy after lunch.Sometimes nods off reading or watching TV.Gets sleepy on long drives (&#62;1 hr) but no mishaps.Physical Exam109 kg, 1.76 m, BMI 35.2. &#8594; Class 2 obesity.BP 140/108, HR 74, RR 16.Small Upper AirwayLarge swollen uvula.Low lying soft palate.Big tongue.Chest &#38; Cardiac Exams are normal.Period of no airflow despite respiratory effortWe see movement of the rib cage, but there&#8217;s a flat line in the airflow.This causes a brief arousal from sleep, and airway opening, followed by the patient falling back to sleep.This is characteristic of upper airway obstruction &#8594; sleep apnea.This doesn&#8217;t necessarily happen only once!This is an example of where the patient has periods of wakefulness/sleep because of repeated airway obstruction.This can be seen in small increases in brain activity upon wakefulness &#8594; the patient isn&#8217;t awake enough to realize that this is happening, but it does affect the quality of sleep.This is a compacted oxygen saturation curve for an entire night. There are huge fluctuations in saturation due to obstruction during sleep. This is seen as a &#39;noisy&#39; curve.Upper Airway ObstructionWith sleep apnea, there is obstruction of the upper airway.This is complicated by the fact that heavy inspiration can cause further constriction of the airway.As a result, when a patient has partially obstructed air flow affecting inspiration, and they try to breathe more heavily, their airway can shut!Airway obstruction can be viewed as a balance of forces between forces that keep the airway open and forces that close it:Pharyngeal muscle tone helps keep the airway open.Reduced intraluminal Pressure or increased extraluminal pressure helps keep the airway closed.Risk Factors for Upper Airway ObstructionFat, wide neck.Retrognathia &#8594; a recessed chin (mandible), is also an anatomical risk factor that increases risk of obstruction.A low, soft palateKissing tonsils, or a large uvula.Lateral narrowing, or a large tongue &#8594; macroglossia.Retrognathia is a common anatomical risk factor that is immediately evident.A low soft palate also increases susceptibility by decreasing the physical size of the airwaySimilarly, &#39;kissing tonsils&#39; or a large uvula, reduce airway size.Sleep Apnea Risk FactorsObesity &#8594; by far the biggest one. Can magnify existing anatomical risk factors by adding more mass everywhere!Increasing age &#8594; loss of tissue tone as you age.Anatomic abnormalities of upper airway &#8594; described above.Family HistoryAlcohol or sedative use &#8594; reduces muscle tone during sleep.Smoking &#8594; an inflammatory response can cause thickening of the airways.Male Gender.Treatment OptionsConservativeWeight loss. &#8594; weight loss can almost always reduce the severity of symptoms, or even eliminate them completely!Avoidance of alcohol.Smoking cessation.Alteration of body position during sleep.Treatment of nasal obstruction.TherapiesCPAP (BiLevel, AutoPap)Oral Appliances (airway dilators)Dental devices can help move the lower jaw forward.This may be useful in patients with retrognathia.Surgery &#8594; dicussed in the next lecture on Surgery.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/17/sleep-disordered-breathing-case.html"},
	{"title": "Pneumonia &amp; Pulmonary Infections Small Group Session", "text": "Case 1A 42 yr old woman with a complex fracture of the left hip following a motor vehicle accident was admitted for treatment of a fractured left hip. Shortly after admission, she developed a fever (39.5), productive cough, chills, and malaise. Her chest X-ray showed diffuse consolidation of the right upper lobe. Laboratory work showed leucocytosis with a left shift. Blood cultures were taken, but unfortunately she died before the results were available.We see a lobar pneumonia, more suggestive of typical pneumonia.Pneumococcal pneumonia would be the most likely in this case.Histology shows red hepatization &#8594; lungs that look like liver, with lots of RBCs.This then progresses to gray hepatization &#8594; the RBCs are then gone, and are replaced by fibrin and macrophages.1. What is the Most Likely Cause of this Pumonary Consolidation?Infection &#8594; viral/bacterial.Neoplasm, inflammation, pulmonary embolism (won&#8217;t cause fever/chills).Likely lobar pneumonia &#8594; diffuse consolidation in the entire lobe.2. What was the most likely organism cultured from her blood?Strep. pneumoniae &#8594; 95%.3. Is this a nosocomial pneumonia?No, it occurred immediately after admission. She most likely acquired the infection in the community &#8594; Community Acquired Pneumonia.4. What is the usual outcome of this type of pneumonia? Does her histology look serious enough to have caused her death?Usually patients have a good outcome with antibiotic therapy (Macrolides, or in this case a fluoroquinolone because she has comorbidities).She may have had sepsis or shock, bacteremia, and vascular collapse (the lung blood vessels collapse).Her survival was less favourable due to severe trauma, as well as her age.Usually gram negatives cause shock, but in this case, it was likely her the pneumococcus that caused the sepsis.Case 2A 50 year old man has been in the hospital for the past month with a debilitating neurological disorder which eventually proved to be Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. While in the hospital, he developed a productive cough with thick, yellow-greenish sputum, fever and eventually shock. His laboratory studies showed marked leucocytosis with a left shift. Aggressive antibiotic therapy was initiated with broad spectrum antibiotics but he died 3 days later.1. What is the most likely cause of his respiratory problems?Nosocomial pneumonia.Differential would also have neoplasm, infection, TB.2. What is likely to be the etiology of this problem?Aspiration of the oral flora, particularly gram negative organisms, fungi, or staph.Could be MRSA.3. What are likely to be the predisposing causes for his pulmonary problem?The patient&#8217;s ALS impaired his ability to protect his airways, making it more likely for him to aspirate bacteria.Long hospital stay increases exposure to bacteria.4. If he had survived, what possible complications could he have developed?Pleural abcess, pyothorax (empyema), sepsis, shock, death.Case 3A 78 year old man living in a retirement home developed what appeared to be flu-like symptoms with sneezing, a dry cough, chills, headaches and malaise. 7 days later his symptoms worsened and developed high fever, prostration, a cough productive of a small amount of clear sputum and shortness of breath. On admission he was found to be hypoxic and in significant distress. A chest x-ray showed diffuse ground-glass appearance of both lungs. He died shortly after.NotesGeneral body ache.Viral infection &#8594; dry cough, chills, headache, flu-like.White stuff at bottom of CXR &#8594; ground-glass pattern.Non purulent sputum makes this more likely to be viral.1. What is likely to be his pulmonary problem?Viral pneumonia due to influenza.2. How could you have confirmed the diagnosis?By serology &#8594; viral cultures have poor sensitivity and take a long time.Serological tests include PCR and ELISA.Can also look for serum antibodies &#8594; see if there&#8217;s a 4&#215; increase in IgM or IgG.3. Is there a specific treatment for this condition?No. Supportive therapy would be done though, including prevention of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia, oxygen therapy, antipyretics, etc.4. Who is at risk of developing this disease? Is there a way to prevent it?Influenza is an extremely contagious, acute, self-limited disease of the upper and lower airways.It spreads by droplets and secretions.The elderly, and patients with cardiopulmonary disease are at risk.Vaccines are available, but because the virus alters its surface antigens (Hemagglutinin, Neuraminidase, etc), you have to get the shot every year.Case 4A 55-year-old female with a previous history of undifferentiated small cell carcinoma of the lung (18 months ago) treated by a combination chemotherapy. One week prior to admission, he began to feel unwell and finally was unable to continue at work. He went to see his GP who did a chest x-ray. This demonstrated bilateral reticular nodular infiltrates. The GP referred him back to the Cancer Centre. On examination: obviously unwell with low-grade pyrexia (38.5&#176;C). Patient also complains of shortness of breath on exertion and night sweats.1. Given the chest radiograph appearance, what do you think should be considered in the differential diagnosis?Recurrence of previous disease (SCC)Acute infection &#8594; tuberculosis, fungal infection (aspergillus), etc.Pulmonary changes associated with chemo/radio therapy.For instance, drug induced diffuse insterstitial lung disease caused by bleomycin.Something else new?Additional InvestigationsA transbronchial biopsy was performed, and caseating granulomas (with a necrotic centre) were observed.An AFB stain was performed, and came out positive.2. What is your diagnosis?Tuberculosis (Acid-fast bacilli, plus caseating granulomas).3. What are the two main types of tuberculosis in humans?Primary TuberculosisReactivation/reinfection tuberculosis4. What is the natural course of primary TB?Healing with calcification. However, disease may progress to progressive primary tuberculosis, pleural tuberculosis, tuberculous pneumonia and miliary TB in debilitated individuals and children.Sensitivity (a positive TB skin test) develops at 3-6 weeks.Granulomas do not occur before sensitivity is developed.5. What is the natural course of reactivation/reinfection TB?Reinfection/reactivation is said to be present when the infection occurs in patients who have already developed sensitivity.Usually in subapical portions of the lung and with more intense granulomatous inflammation.If treatment is successful, it will heal with a scar.However, progression may occur resulting in chronic cavitary TBC, tuberculous pneumonia or miliary TBC.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/07/pneumonia-pulmonary-infections-small-group.html"},
	{"title": "Pathology of Obstructive Lung Diseases", "text": "Lecture OutlinePulmonary acinus and its significance in lung disease.Chronic bronchitis vs. emphysema.Classify emphysema.Define bronchiectasis.Asthma vs. chronic bronchitis.Diffuse alveolar damage vs. bronchiolits obliterans-organizing pneumonia.Chronic Lung DiseaseChronic = greater than 6 months in duration.We&#8217;ll mainly be focused on obstructive lung diseases, including:Chronic BronchitisEmphysemaAsthmaBronchiectasisBronchiolitisNormal Bronchial MucosaNormally, the airways are lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium.There are also goblet cells which produce mucous.Chronic BronchitisA clinical syndrome: productive cough on most days x 3 months/yr for 2 succesive yearsInitiating factor: chronic irritation by inhaled substances.Etiology of Chronic BronchitisCigarette Smoking (80%).Atmospheric pollution &#8594; urban incidence greater than rural.Pathogenesis of Chronic BronchitisIrritationNeutrophils are recruited, and they release granules.Proteases are released, including elastase and cathepsin.Mucous hypersecretion.Protective metaplastic reactions occur:Hyperplasia of submucosal glands (to produce more mucous)Goblet cell hyperplasia (to also produce more mucous)Squamous metaplasia (squamous conversion to protect airways)In chronic bronchitis, the key pathological element here is the excessive production of mucous.This is due to the submucosal gland hyperplasia and goblet cell hyperplasia discussed above.The squamous metaplasia is due to the fact that the ciliated pseudostrafied columnar cells are very delicate, and they convert to a more hardy cell type.Metaplastic Reactions with Chronic BronchitisSubmucosal Gland HyperplasiaGoblet Cell HyperplasiaSquamous MetaplasiaThe Reid IndexThe Reid Index lets us assess the degree of submucosal gland hyperplasia.Basically, we compare the thickness of the glands (b - c) to the thickness of the bronchial wall (a-d).Normally, this ratio should be 0.4 or less.In other words, the Reid index is:$$ \text{Reid Index} = \frac{\text{Gland thickness}}{\text{Bronchial Wall Thickness}} $$Infections in Chronic BronchitisThis excessive mucous causes coughing &#8594; this is why patients with chronic bronchitis have a productive cough.But not only does it cause infection, but it also serves as a substrate for bacteria (it&#8217;s very proteinaceous).This causes exacerbations.If the patient continues to smoke, then continued squamous metaplasia means that there will be less ciliary action, to remove the mucous.Cigarette smoke also has anti-leukocytic properties.EmpysemaEmphysema is caused by enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole due to alveolar wall destruction.So emphysema does not directly involve the airways!Chronic airflow obstruction occurs due to air trapping and forcible expiration.Epidemiology of EmphysemaIncidence: 50% of population over 50 &#8594; very common!80% of smokers.18% of non-smokers.in smokers: more severe and earlier in age.However, the patients that will have symptoms will be a subset of these.symptoms when 25% of lung involved.in non-smokers 6.7% mean involvement.in smokers: 26.4% mean involvement.The normal alveolar wall includes:Type 1 PneumocytesType 2 PneumocytesInterstitial TissueEndothelial CellsClassification of EmphysemaEmphysema can be classified into 3 different types, depending on its location:Centrilobular (CLE) &#8594; respiratory bronchioles.Panacinar (PAE) &#8594; whole lobule.Paraseptal/localized &#8594; subpleural and septal.Centrilobular Emphysema (CLE)Centrilobular Emphysema mainly involves the respiratory bronchioles, with relative sparing of the alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs.Also known as proximal acinar or centriacinar.This comprises of 75% of clinically significant emphysema, and is usually seen in the upper lobes of heavy smokers.Panacinar Emphysema (PAE)Panacinar Emphysema involves the whole acinus &#8594; includes the respiratory bronchioles, but also the alveolar ducts and alveoli.Predominantly seen in the lower lobes.Usually seen in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, leading to an imbalance between trypsin and antitrypsin levels.Paraseptal (localized) emphysemaVery common in young individuals with spontaneous pneumothoraxes.Seen at the peripheral portion of the acinus.Subpleural and along the septa.The remainder of the lung is usually normal.Comparison of Types of EmphysemaCentrilobular Emphysema (CLE)Involves the respiratory bronchioles.Localized to the upper lobes.Typically presents in heavy smokers.Panacinar Emphysema (PAE)Involves the entire acinus.Localized to the lower lobes.Typically presents in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.Paraseptal (localized) emphysemaInvolves the peripheral portion of the acinus.Localized to the subpleural and septal regions.Typically seen in young individuals with spontaneous pneumothoraxes.Etiology of Symptomatic EmphysemaSmoking, PollutionChemotactic for PMN&#8217;s &#8594; release of proteases such as elastase.This overwhelms the body&#8217;s inhibition of elastase by antielastases.Normally you don&#8217;t see the effects of elastase because of antielastases such as Alpha-1 antitrypsin, which moderate the effects of elastase.Alpha-1 AT DeficiencyAlpha-1 antitrypsin is an antielastase.In patients with Alpha-1 AT deficiency, they don&#8217;t have the protective effect of anti-elastase action.If these patients smoke, they&#8217;ll have even worse emphysema.Pathogenesis of EmphysemaThe most plausible hypotheses are:Imbalance between Proteases and antiproteases &#8594; trypsin vs. antitrypsin.Smoking causes irritation, and is chemotactic for PMNs.PMNs release proteases such as elastase, which degrade the alveolar walls.As befitting the name, it particularly degrades elastic tissue, which is why the lung becomes less compliant.Normally, this elastase is controlled by antielastases such as alpha-1 antitrypsin.In smoking however, this control is overwhelmed because of extreme PMN recruitment.In alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, this imbalance is because we have a deficiency in the antielastases.Imbalance between oxidants and antioxidantsThis wasn&#8217;t covered.But conceptually, here we have an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants, leading to oxidative stress and alveolar wall damage.AsthmaAsthma is an inflammatory disease of the airway.It&#8217;s characterized by hyperreactive airways and episodes of reversible bronchoconstriction.Pathogenesis of AsthmaDisease is triggered by environmental antigens (eg. dusts, pollens, foods).Classic IgE mediated Type I hypersensitivity reaction.Part of the Atopic Triad:Atopic DermatisisAsthmaAllergic RhinitisPathology of AsthmaVery similar to chronic bronchitis &#8594; will see mucous obstruction.Alternating areas of collapse and distention.On microscopy, you will see:Thick smooth muscle.Edema and inflammation (with eosinophils and plasma cells) of submucosa, and a thick basement membrane.Will see goblet cell hyperplasia, and submucosal gland hyperplasia, similarly with chronic bronchitis.So asthma can be histologically differentiated from chronic bronchitis due to the presence of thick smooth muscle, eosinophils, and a thick basement membrane.RememberHistologically, asthma can be differentiated from chronic bronchitis due to the presence of:Thick Smooth MuscleEosinophils (&#8593;IgE)Thick Basement Membrane.Summary of AsthmaReversible airway obstruction.Hypertrophy of smooth muscle.Edema and inflammation of submucosa.Hyperplasia of mucous glands and increased goblet cells.Thickened basement membrane.BronchiectasisBronchiectasis is the permanent dilation of the bronchi as a result of, or in association with, chronic infection.These widened bronchi are even more susceptible to infection!Etiologically, it can be separated into:Obstructive Causes &#8594; tumours, foreign bodies, mucous, etc.Non-Obstructive Causes &#8594; congenital, CF, infections (Staph, TB), immunodeficiencies.With bronciectasis, we will have an abnormal clearance of secretions &#8594; secondary infections &#8594; more destruction.This causes a vicious cycle!Because of this abnormal secretion clearance, secondary to the infection, these patients will have a smelly sputum, fever, and cough.Microscopic ExaminationSquamous metaplasia of mucosa &#8594; there&#8217;s chronic inflammation! This metaplasia also worsens mucous clearance.Mucous plugging &#8594; you can&#8217;t clear the mucous properly.BronchopneumoniaComplicationsPulmonary abscessSymptoms of chronic obstructive lung diseaseAmyloidosisBronchiolitisBronchiolitis is inflammation of the bronchioles (small airways).There&#8217;s a long list of possible causes.These have a variable outcome, and may lead to bronchiectasis.RememberBronchiolitis differs from chronic bronchitis or asthma, in that there&#8217;s inflammation of the small airways.Bronchiectasis vs BronchiolitisBronchiectasis = permanent dilation of bronchi.Bronchiolitis = inflammation of the bronchioles.Acute Obstructive Lung DiseasesThese are caused by acute lung injury.Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) &#8594; the pathology equivalent of ARDS.Acute Interstitial Pneumonia &#8594; a very rare condition.Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP)OverviewConsiderable overlap in the 3 conditions.Same insult can result in different injury patterns.Common denominator is acute injury to lung acinus &#8594; particularly the alveolar ducts and the alveolar sacs.Diffuse Alveolar DamageClinically, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) = Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.As was seen in our ARDS lecture, causes include:Infections (SARS)ShockDrugsRadiationAspirationOxygen toxicityThe ultimate consequence is acute damage to both the epithelial cells and endothelial cells.DAD is an acute injury and repair process, and in the process of repair, respiratory failure may occur.Pathogenesis of DADInjury of Type I Pneumocytes (epithelial lining), and endothelial cells.Inflammation increases permeability, causing fluid leakage, and protein transit to the alveolar spaces and interstitium. This is the exudative phase.After the acute injury, hyaline membranes form.hyaline membranes &#8594; translucent membranes comprised of precipitated plasma proteins, cell debris and surfactant.They appear around 2 days after the acute insult, and peak on day 4-5.This worsen&#8217;s gas exchange &#8594; the membrane increases the diffusion distance!Around day 7, there will be the fibroblast profileration, repair with scarring, and pulmonary fibrosis. This is the proliferative phase.Transition from acute to chronic inflammation, to repair the injury.However, the damaged regions become fibrosed and less effective!So there is a permanent effect on lung function.After chronic inflammation and repair, the regions where there was alveolar damage end up being thickened and fibrosed.

Failure in the Ventilatory PumpDisease involving the extrapulmonary compartment.Could be anything along the ventilatory pump pathway.For instance, it could be an upstream problem in the respiratory center in the brain, or it could be a downstream problem with the thoracic cage.Some examples include diseases that cause muscle weakness/paralysis, such as ALS or Myasthenia gravis.Impaired alveolar ventilation.Associated respiratory acidosis.Hypercarbia, and possible hypoxemia later on.2. Failure of the Lung ParenchymaDisease involving the pulmonary compartmentDecrease in gas exchange between the distal airway-alveolus and pulmonary capillary bloodPaO2 &#60;60 mmHg on a FIO2 &#62;0.60 &#8594; the oxygen input is good enough, but it&#8217;s not transferring into your arterial blood!Hypoxemia with hypercapnia later on.There may be metabolic acidosis because the body will create lactate via the anaerobic metabolism.Note that a change in pH due to hypercarbia will not happen, until the respiratory failure is extremely late stage and hypercarbia actually occurs.The acidosis you typically see is this metabolic acidosis!Here is an example of a chest radiograph showing parenchymal disease.There is extensive airway disease, resulting in shunt.This causes severe hypoxemia.We see air bronchograms &#8594; you can see the outline of the lobar bronchi.The presence of these air bronchograms suggests that this is an air-space filling process.You have patent airways to the airspaces, but the airspaces themselves are consolidated or filled with something.Air bronchograms will cause egophony, bronchial breathing, etc, on clinical exam.With parenchymal lung disease, the presence of shunt means that the patient will not be responsive to oxygen therapy (if there&#8217;s no ventilation, it doesn&#8217;t matter what the inspired oxygen is).This can be seen on the right, where with increasing percentages of shunt, there is less of a increase in PaO2 with an increase in inspired oxygen concentration.Types of Respiratory FailureARDS &#8594; Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.COPD Exacerbation.Neuromuscular Weakness.Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)This is not a disease, it&#8217;s a syndrome &#8594; many diseases can cause it.To qualify as ARDS:Respiratory symptoms must have begun within one week of a known clinical insult, or the patient must have new or worsening symptoms during the past week.Bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema must be present on a CXR or CT. These opacities must not be fully explained by pleural effusions, lobar collapse, lung collapse, or pulmonary nodules.The patient&#8217;s respiratory failure must not be fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload.A moderate to severe impairment of oxygenation must be present.To Qualify as ARDSSymptoms must have occurred within the past week.CXR evidence of pulmonary edema.Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure/fluid overload.Moderate/severe hypoxemia.This is what we saw in the Pulmonary Circulation lecture.As we saw in Heart &#38; Circulation, fluid filtration in the lung depends on a balance between hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure:	Starling's Equation	$$Q_f = K_f \big[(P_{mv} - P_i) - \sigma_f(\pi_{mv} - \pi_{i}) \big]$$Where we have that:Pmv is the microvascular hydrostatic pressure.Pi is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure.&#960;mv is the microvascular oncotic pressure.&#960;i is the interstitial oncotic pressure.Kf is the filtration coefficient &#8212; a proportionality constant.&#963;f is the reflection coefficient.Cardiogenic Pulmonary EdemaIn cardiogenic pulmonary edema, there&#8217;s an increase in hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vasculature due to left sided heart failure, which forces fluid from the intravascular spaces into the airways.This is by far the most common form of pulmonary edema.Non-Cardiogenic Pulmonary EdemaThis is what we have with ARDS, due to Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD).In non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, we have fluid exudation from the pulmonary vasculature into the air spaces due to leakiness of the vasculature in some way.In this case, there&#8217;s no increase in pressure, there&#8217;s just junctional leakage.This can be seen in patients with sepsis, with histamine-mediated junctional retraction, for instance.This is generally more lethal, and more difficult to treat than cardiogenic pulmonary edema.In Starling&#8217;s Equation, this is reflected as a change in the filtration coefficient.RememberARDS = Non-Cardiogenic Pulmonary EdemaCauses and Predisposing Conditions of ARDSDirect Lung InjuryPneumoniaAspiration of Gastric ContentsIndirect Lung InjurySepsis &#8594; histamine mediated junctional retraction.Severe Trauma &#8594; shock and burns.A CXR and CT of a patient with pulmonary edema. You can see collapsed and atelectatic regions of the lung in the dependent regions (the patient is lying supine). This is because the fluid flows with gravity, and is soaked up by the lungs like a sponge!Management of ARDSTreat the underlying cause!Treat the hypoxemiaMask oxygen.Mechanical ventilation.PEEP.The idea of mechanical ventilation is to give them smaller tidal breaths at a faster rate, to reduce alveolar damage due to lung collapse in patients with ARDS.With PEEP, we have a positive end airway pressure, which helps keep the alveoli open at the end of respiration to prevent collapse. - It also helps shift the hydrostatic pressure gradient, which moves fluid from the air spaces into the interstitium.This reduces areas of atelectasis, supporting injured lungs.Oxygen Delivery SystemsNasal prongs.High flow masks.Low flow masks.Rebreathing and anaesthetic type oxygen masks.Oxygen saturation can be assessed with a pulse oximeter.RememberThe goal is to keep your PaO2 above 60, which will keep your SaO2 above 90%.1. Nasal ProngsPut prongs in the nares of your nose.100% oxygen is delivered, although this is diluted by the air that you breathe.If you increase the flow of 100% oxygen, then the inspired oxygen concentration will increase as well.However, it&#8217;s not completely certain how much the true inspired oxygen increases as you increase the flow of 100% oxygen &#8594; it depends on how you breathe.Prongs are convenient in that they&#8217;re portable, comfortable, and can be brought home.2. High Flow MasksHigh flow (venturi) face masks work by providing flow to the mask that is greater than the flow of expiration.That way, the air you breathe in can be mixed with supplemental oxygen, and the waste gas that&#8217;s emitted can still be eliminated from the mask.This is good in patients that require a smaller percentage of supplemental oxygenOne example would be the patient with chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia.Since they have a blunted hypercapnic ventilatory response, in order to reduce their work of breathing, their breathing will primarily be driven by their hypoxic ventilatory response.If you suddenly gave them 100% oxygen via nasal prongs, they may lose this hypoxic drive, and stop breathing!This gives you an easy way to give you low percentages of oxygen!3. Low Flow MasksWould be used, for example, in a patient in the post-operative period that just came off an anesthetic, who may be under-breathing a little.Gives you safe oxygenation with humidity.You may have some rebreathing of your exhaled gas, unlike with a high flow mask, so these are used in less serious clinical situations.Since you don&#8217;t have the high flow out of the mask, your expired gases aren&#8217;t completely eliminated, so it will mix with the supplemental oxygen in the mask.4. Rebreathing and Anaesthetic Type Oxygen MasksUsed in patients with an extremely high need for oxygen.There&#8217;ll be a reservoir bag of 100% oxygen, with one-way valves that allow oxygen out, but prevent expired gas from going in.This allows oxygen to come out of the bag, and expired gas to go out the mask.The mask isn&#8217;t completely tight, but this is as close to 100% oxygen as you can get!The mask can be connected to a handheld pump so you can manually ventilate as well.Ventilation TherapyPositive pressure ventilation.Delivery via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube.Provides both secure ventilation and oxygenation.Can deliver volume or pressure determined tidal volume.Can be delivered non-invasivelyPEEP &#8594; Positive End Expiratory Pressure.PEEP is used to increase the pressure at the end of a breath.This is used often to keep alveoli open to improve ventilation, in patients with ARDS.Endotracheal Intubation can also be done to establish a patent airway.Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV) &#8594; ventilation is delivered non-invasively. CPAP and BiPAP are examples.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/07/respiratory-failure.html"},

You never know what you&#8217;ll see.Below is an example of oral cavity cancer, which is a fairly common cancer.Our tongue actually has two parts:The oral tongue in the front.The oropharyngeal tongue in the back.The lips are also classified as part of the oral cavity.Ludwig&#8217;s Angina &#8594; dental infection causes a swollen tongue.Pus on top of the mylohyoid muscle pushes onto the tongue and blocks the airway. Can cause them to gag on their own tongue.Pus below the mylohyoid muscle can travel down into the chest and kill patients as well!The above image is an example of Ludwig&#39;s angina causing a swollen tongue blocking the airway.Anatomy of the TongueThere is a Submandibular gland below the mandible feeding a submandibular duct going below the tongue.With respect to the anterial oral tongue, there is a lingual nerve that receives taste sensation.The lingual nerve is a branch of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve.If a patient has a nicked lingual nerve, they will have impaired taste.Motor innervation of the tongue comes from the hypoglossal nerve &#8594; the 12th cranial nerve, as we saw before.Blood supply for the oral tongue comes from the lingual artery, which branches from the external carotid.Nose &#38; SinusHoles for the eyeball (the orbit) can be seen.There&#8217;s also an Ethmoid Sinus.Anatomy of the Nose &#38; SinusCribriform plate &#8594; a sieve like plate on the base of the skull which is extremely thin &#8594; you can see through it!Olfactory nerves feed through it.The cribriform plate is superior to the nose cavity!When your face gets hit hard, you can actually break through the cribriform plate, and have CSF bleeding.The pituitary gland rests on the base of the skull as well, near where the crifriborm plate is.There are turbinates (inferior, middle, and superior) that are bulges in your nose.They can get swollen, impairing air flow.Tucked underneath the turbinates are holes that drain the sinuses.One of the treatments for sinusitis are medications that reduce turbinate swelling to let the sinuses drain normally.An image showing the 3 turbinates. Make sure you know what they look like so you don&#39;t mistake normal anatomy for a polyp!Epistaxis = Bloody nose.You need to learn how to pack a bloody nose!Layer it in from the bottom up to avoid breaking the cribriform.Nowadays, there are things called Merocel Sponges, which are much easier to apply.Blood supply of the lateral nasal wall comes from the internal carotid and the external carotid &#8594; from the inside of the skull, and the outside of the skull.Anterior bleeds generally resolve with pressure, but posterior bleeds often require surgery or interventional treatment.Pharynx &#38; PalateThe trachea and lungs are basically an outgrowth from the gut evolutionarily. This is why the two tubes are connected, even though it may seem mechanistically stupid.The throat is split into 3 parts.Nasopharynx &#8594; behind the nose.Oropharynx &#8594; behind the mouth.Laryngopharynx (Clinicians call this the Hypopharynx)Posterior to the larynx and laryngeal inlet.Here is a coin lodged in the swallowing tube. It&#39;s rather high up, so it may be dangerous if the child coughs it up and re-embeds it in the airway.Anatomy of the Pharynx &#38; PalateThe tonsils are the green things in the diagram.Pharyngeal tonsils = Adenoids. If these are inflammed, it becomes very difficult to breathe.There is a pharyngotympanic tube, aka. the eustachian tube that is protected by the tubal tonsil, and leads to the ear.This tube can easily be obstructed to affect hearing because fluid accumulates in the ear. This also predisposes to ear infections.This effect on hearing is significant in pediatric populations because it can affect language development.Also, one of the presenting symptoms of a nasopharyngeal cancer is actually unilateral hearing loss because of obstruction of the eustachian tube!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/06/head-neck-anatomy-2.html"},
	{"title": "Respirology Small Group Cases 7-10", "text": "Case 7Pneumonia in a previously healthy young womanA 25 year old woman, previously healthy, was well until 5 days ago when she developed pharyngitis, a fever and a nonproductive cough. Her family doctor prescribed a course of Amoxil for her but her symptoms worsened. When seen in the emergency department today she complains of malaise, myalgia, headache, anorexia, continuing fever, a slightly productive cough, and shortness of breath. She states that she has not recently travelled. Her boyfriend has had a &#8220;hacking&#8221; cough, but has otherwise felt well. She denies HIV risk factors.Physical examinationShe appears acutely ill. Temperature is 39&#176;C. She coughs frequently during the examination. Respiratory rate is 22/minute. Pulse rate is 100/minute. Blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. ENT exam is unremarkable. Auscultation of the chest reveals inspiratory crackles, particularly at the right lung base.CXRBilateral lower lobe interstitial and alveolar infiltrates.Sputum examinationA few pus cells, but no organisms on gram stain are seen.NotesBilateral infiltrates, obfuscation of the cardiac silhouette suggests that it&#8217;s an anterior infiltrate.From the patient history, this suggests that it&#8217;s a Community Acquired Pneumonia.1. In general terms, classify this woman&#8217;s pneumonia. Suggest common etiologic agents that are seen in this type of pneumonia.Common etiologic agents for a 25 y/o female? No purulent sputum suggests it&#8217;s not bacterial.Since there are bilateral infiltrates, this would be classified as an atypical pneumoniaMycoplasma.Chlamydia.Legionella.2. What further investigations would be indicated in the diagnosis of this woman&#8217;s pneumonia?Blood work to identify possible missed diagnoses.A CT scan would show the same things as a chest X-ray, and it would delay therapy!Blood gases wouldn&#8217;t be necessary.3. Discuss the antibiotic therapy you would administer? Explain you reasoning.Macrolides &#8594; Erythromycin, Clarithromycin, Azithromycin.Erythromycin is poorly tolerated and has lots of side effects, so we would usually not use it first.Generally we only use erythromycin in pregnant women, because we don&#8217;t know if the other two have side effects during pregnancy.Obviously, these antibiotics would not be effective in the case of a patient with a viral pneumonia, but it&#8217;d be difficult to differentiate this from an infection with legionella for instance, which is difficult to culture.Case 865 year old man with nicotine dependenceA 65 year old man presents for a routine visit to the clinic. He has longstanding diabetes that is controlled with insulin injections. He has had bouts of acute bronchitis and pneumonia in the past and recently had a small heart attack. He has smoked one pack per day for 40 years. He has his first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking. He has tried several times to quit and has used Nicorette gum before with limited success.He has managed to cut down to a half-pack per day, but has found it difficult. He smokes first thing in the morning upon awakening and has a cigarette just before he goes to bed.He has been thinking about his smoking since his heart attack and his family has been encouraging him to quit. He isn&#8217;t sure that he can because he has been smoking for so long. He has heard that the &#8220;patch&#8221; and the &#8220;gum&#8221; aren&#8217;t safe in people with heart problems and he doesn&#8217;t think he can go &#8220;cold turkey&#8221;.1. Describe the short-term and long-term benefits that the patient would receive from smoking cessation.Short Term Improvements &#8594; generally, cardiovascular function improves faster than pulmonary function.Reduction in Blood Pressure.Consequently, a reduction in heart rate due to reduced preload.Reduced CAD risk.Long Term ImprovementsImprovement in lung function.Reduced risk of lung cancer, although the risk is always there.2. How would you apply the 5 A&#8217;s to smoking cessation counseling in this patient?AskAssess ReadinessAdvise &#8594; one of the only non-pharmacological interventions that have been shown to be effective.AssistArrange &#8594; if the patient isn&#8217;t ready, arrange for a follow up, for any reason!3. How would you address his concerns that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is not safe in patients who have heart disease?It&#8217;s more safe than smoking!Here we can control the dose to minimize risk as well.4. What non-pharmaceutical strategies might be helpful to him in quitting smoking?Spousal support.Removing triggers such as ashtrays.5. What pharmaceutical agents, other than nicotine replacement, might be useful in helping him quit?2 classes of drugs:Buproprion (Zyban)Varenicline &#8594; extremely effective, but poor tolerability.Case 9Hemoptysis and possible pulmonary cavity in an immigrant.A 30 year old woman, who had immigrated to Canada from China 12 months ago, had noted a decrease of energy and a 10 lb. weight loss over the past 4 months. She now has a cough, occasionally productive of bloody sputum. She is a nonsmoker.Physical examinationShe is ill and cachectic. Temperature is 37.5oC. Respiratory rate is 22/minute. Pulse rate is 85/minute. There are a few questionable inspiratory crackles on auscultation of the left upper lobe.CXRAn ill-defined infiltrate is present in the left upper lobe. There is apears to be a lucency within the infiltrate and the radiologist speculates that a cavity may be present.Diffuse infiltrate versus a localized one makes it less likely to be pneumonia.Follow up film shows an improvement.1. Give a brief differential diagnosis for hemoptysis and the upper lobe infiltrate in this woman?Lung cancer &#8594; malignancy. Unlikely, 25 y/o non-smoker.Pulmonary EmbolismTuberculosis &#8594; most common cause of hemoptysis in the world!Trick question &#8594; whenever a respirologist asks anything that ends with &#8216;in the world&#8217;, it&#8217;s TB!What if the patient was from Ontario, TB would still be on the top of the list, because although it&#8217;s not as definite, it&#8217;s highly contagious!2. What investigations would you initially perform to aid you in a diagnosis?Ziehl-Neelsen stain (Acid Fast) of the sputum.Chest X-Ray, as was already done.If the cough was not productive, you could induce sputum in a negative-pressure room.The next step would be bronchoscopy, if the patient was in a hospital.Wouldn&#8217;t want the patient to be free in a hospital &#8594; don&#8217;t want to infect everyone else!You should keep them isolated at home.In less highly-suspicious cases, could also send it for gram stain and cytology. But here, the AFB (Acid Fast Bacilli) is critical!3. Clumps of acid fast bacilli are seen on a sputum smear. What is your diagnosis?Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis4. What is your recommended therapy?As we saw in Infection &#38; Immunity:IsoniazidEthambutolRifampinPyrazinamideDoxycycline could be added.Public Health also has to be notified in the case of an active case of tuberculosis.5. What are the possible adverse effects of this therapy?Hepatotoxicity with Isoniazid and Rifampin.Rifampin turns urine orange!Rifampin can also inactivate the birth control pill.Ethambutol can cause colour blindness sometimes.Doxycycline stains adult teeth (don&#8217;t use in children), and can also cause photosensitivity.6. The patient&#8217;s 30 year old husband is concerned that he has the same disease. He is asymptomatic. The physical examination is normal. What tests can you recommend &#8212; if any, and why?He&#8217;s asymptomatic.TB-skin test probably positive because he&#8217;s from China, and there&#8217;s also a widespread use of the BCG vaccine.So a positive TB-skin test isn&#8217;t particularly informative in the case of active disease.Hence we&#8217;d need to do a chest x-ray.Follow up with the patient.Wouldn&#8217;t treat the patient if they&#8217;re healthy, but you would follow them up.Would only treat if it&#8217;s a high risk group.Would also have 6 months of Isoniazid prophylaxis in the case where the positive TB-test isn&#8217;t from a past infection and the current infection is gestational.Case 10An alcoholic and pulmonary cavity.A 53 year old alcoholic man was admitted to the hospital with malaise, dehydration, and 48 hours of, fever, with the production of excessively purulent and foul sputum. Past medical history revealed recurrent admissions to the emergency room for confusion secondary to intoxication and/or alcohol withdrawal seizures.Physical examinationRespiratory distress is noted with a respiratory rate of 35/minute. RR is 26/min and BP is 110/75. Temperature is 40.0&#176;C. Dullness to percussion, and inspiratory crackles are present over the left upper lobe posteriorly. Dental and oral hygiene is poor with carious teeth and foul breath.CXRA 3.5 cm cavity with a fluid level is present in the left upper lobe.CBCWhite blood cell count is elevated at 20,000/mL.If you ever see a straight line in a chest X-ray, it&#8217;s an air-fluid level, due to fluid accumulation settling due to gravity.A posterior lung abcess is a likely location because a patient like this will likely pass out and aspirate, so more likely locations would be the dependent ones (eg. the posterior one where gravity does its job).1. What is your differential diagnosis?Tuberculosis &#8594; always on the top of your list because it&#8217;s contagious!Lung abcess &#8594; makes sense give the time-course. Malaise, progressively more purulent sputum.Cavitating NeoplasmNecrotizing Pneumonia2. What risk factors predispose for the development of this disease?Poor oral hygiene &#8594; periodontal disease and carious teeth.What if the patient didn&#8217;t have teeth?Wouldn&#8217;t be a lung abcess because you need a substrate for the bacteria to be cultured and aspirated. Would be more likely to be a cavitating neoplasm.Poor airway protection due to altered level of consciousness.3. Outline your initial treatment and follow-up.The most common causes of lung abcesses are anaerobes &#8594; causes the gradual evolution and foul smelling sputum.The archetypical anaerobic drug we saw in Infection &#38; Immunity was Metronidazole, but it can&#8217;t be used here because it poorly penetrates the lungs.The first choice drug here is Penicillin G (Benzylpenicillin), and as a second choice sometimes, Clindamycin.Without treatment, pus could enter the pleural space, causing empyema.Would require follow up CXR in 6-8 weeks to make sure the patient is adherent and recovering.Counselling on alcohol abuse would also be important.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/06/respiratory-medicine-small-group.html"},
	{"title": "Clinical Aspects &amp; Pathology of Diffuse Interstitial Lung Diseases", "text": "Lecture OutlineDILD = Diffuse Interstitial Lung DiseaseWill see diffuse infiltrates on CXR.Aim to classify DILD based on etiologyUnderstand a respirologists&#8217; general approach to DILDLearn and integrate the clinical, radiologic &amp; pathologic features of two common types of DILD:Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)Pulmonary sarcoidosisRestrictive Lung DiseaseDiffuse Interstitial Lung Diseases are a type of Restrictive Lung Disease (versus Obstructive Lung Diseases like COPD and Asthma).Restrictive lung diseaes are split into two categories:Parenchymal &#8594; anything in the lungs.Acute: infection, inflammation, edema, etc.Subacute/chronic: DILD.Extraparenchymal &#8594; anything outside of the lungs that&#8217;s restrictive.Kyphoscoliosis (significant), significant bilateral pleural disease, massive obesity, diaphragmatic paralysis, etc.Restrictive vs Obstructive Lung DiseasesFindings with Pulmonary Function TestsWill see a symmetric reduction in lung volumes on the PFT.Decrease in diffusion capacity (DLCO).With parenchymal disease, there will be a disproportionate decrease.With extraparenchymal disease, there will be a proportionate decrease.This makes sense &#8594; if it&#8217;s something in the lungs, you&#8217;ll see greater effects on diffusion than you would expect given the lung volume reduction.Unlike obstructive diseases, you&#8217;ll see a normal FEV1/FVC.Diagnosing Restrictive Lung DiseasesReduction in Lung Volumes with a normal FEV1/FVC.There will be a decrease in the DLCOIn parenchymal disease, you have a disproportionate decrease in the DLCO.In extraparenchymal disease, you will have a proportionate decrease in the DLCO.Clinical Findings with DILDSymptomsGradually progressive dyspnea with exercise limitation, and possible dry cough.A dry, hacking, non-productive cough is a common finding.The gradually progressive dyspnea is the most penetrant sign however! Patients will usually have several years of worsening SOB, especially with exercise.SignsTachypnea with dry inspiratory cracklesAt the beginning, you have to put the stethoscope at very bottom of lung and make the patient take a deep breath to hear the crackles.This will slowly progress up the chest as the disease progresses.digital clubbing may also be seen.Chest X-RayReduction in lung volumes with diffuse infiltrates.These diffuse infiltrates will lead to end-stage fibrosis that will look like honeycombs &#8594; &#8220;honeycombing&#8221;.HRCTHRCT = High Resolution CT &#8594; you can often see abnormalities on CT earlier than with a chest X-ray.However, these are often non-specific, so even though the sensitivity may be better, the specificity is worse.Clinical Findings with DILDGradually progressive dyspnea with possible dry, non productive cough.Dry inspiratory crackles, and tachypnea.Lung volume reduction with diffuse infiltrates on CXR &#8594; honeycombing.Etiologic Classification of DILDRestrictive Lung Diseases:ParenchymalAcute: infection, inflammation, edema, etc.Subacute/chronic: DILD.Known EtiologyUnknown EtiologyExtraparenchymalKyphoscoliosis (significant), significant bilateral pleural disease, massive obesity, diaphragmatic paralysis, etc.There are many different classification schemes, but one convenient one is to separate DILDs based on known/unknown etiology.1. Diseases of Known EtiologyDiseases of known etiology are much less common than diseases of unknown etiology.However, these can be diagnosed! For unknown etiology, you must make a diagnosis by exclusion!Inorganic &#8594; pneumoconioses, asbestosisDust, metals, fibres.Pneumoconiosis is caused by dust exposure, especially in mines.Asbestosis is caused by asbestos exposure.Organic &#8594; hypersensitivity pneumonitisAny living/recently-living material, that you may have become sensitive to.Appropriately, this is called hypersensitivity pneumonitis.Drugs &#8594; dose-related vs. idiosyncraticSometimes, these are completely dependent on dose.For instance, high-dosage bleomycin (we saw this in Blood).Most of the time, it&#8217;s an idiosyncratic reaction &#8594; eg. a small subset of people taking amiodarone may develop lung scarring.Other &#8594; radiation, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, etc.Radiation to the lungs.Cancer spreading to the lungs.The big three we try to ask about for Hypersensitivity pneumonitis are:Bird Fanciers &#8594; eg. people who keep pigeons.Farmer&#8217;s Lung &#8594; typically a reaction to improperly stored grain.Humifier Lung &#8594; mold growing on a humidifier that hasn&#8217;t been cleaned.The drugs we ask about for Drug-Induced DILD.Nitrofurantoin &#8594; very old urinary antiseptic that old women take for recurrent bladder infections. Huge source of interstitial lung disease.Chemotherapy &#8594; eg.

Diseases of Unknown EtiologyTo diagnose a patient with one of these, you must first rule out the ones of known etiology.Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia (IIP) &#8594; the most common type of DILD.The most common form of IIP is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).IIP with Collagen Vascular Disorders &#8594; IIP with a collagen vascular disorder as well.Dermatomyositis, MCTD, scleroderma, SLE, etc.Sarcoidosis &#8594; will have many other manifestations because granulomas go everywhere.MiscellaneousEosinophilic granuloma, alveolar proteinosis, etc.RememberThe most common type of DILD of unknown etiology is Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia (IIP). The most common form of IIP is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)Clinical Aspects of IPFPresentationUsually middle-aged or elderly patients &#8594; it&#8217;s unusual to see a patient under the age of 50 with this condition.Insidiously progressive dyspnea +/- dry cough.Bibasilar inspiratory crackles +/- clubbing.IPF is one of the most common causes of clubbing in an adult.Will see progressive drops in lung volumes, and diffusion defects, as well as a disproportionate drop in the DLCO, as discussed previously.Basal (bases) and cortical (outside) regions of the lungs are affected first.By definition, as we have said before, other etiologies must be ruled out.RadiologyHere, you can see a CXR showing diffuse infiltrates with that archetypical honeycombed pattern.Note that this is more prevalent at the basal and cortical regions of the lungs, as was described before.Recall that the costo-phrenic angles are the 'corners' of the lungs, where they meet the diaphragm.This patient also has blunting of the left costo-phrenic angle, but this is probably due to something else.Also, note that the lung volumes have decreased.Here is advanced IPF on CT.You can see cystic changes (honeycombing) throughout the entire bottom of the lung.This CT would be conclusively IPF.PrognosisThe prognosis for IPF is bad &#8594; as bad as some cancers.Average survival is 4-5 years, but this is quite variable.Better outcomes are associated with younger age, acute insult causing the onset, or rapid progression.It&#8217;s somewhat counterintuitive that the ones that rapidly progress have better outcomes &#8594; it&#8217;s actually the insidiously progressive ones that generally fare more poorly.TreatmentResponse to high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone) is one of the best prognostic indicators for DILD in general.For instance, hypersenstivity pneumonitis will respond very well to prednisone.However, the most common condition, which is IPF, doesn&#8217;t respond well to steroids.So IPF is typically treated with supportive care &#8594; supplemental oxygen, etc.RememberPrednisone sensitivity is a strong prognostic indicator for DILD, but prednisone is not very effective with IPF.Pathology of IPFIPF is an interstitial inflammatory fibrosing lung disease of unknown etiology.The use of pathology in diagnosing IPF and other diseases has decreased significantly due to the increasing use of imaging for diagnosis.Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is the histological pattern of fibrosis.With IPF, you will have a honeycomb lung.The lung will be firm to the touch, and there will be holes in the lung, that will be preferentially located on the basal and cortical regions. (bottom and sides).Pathogenesis of IPFThere are two theories as to the pathogenesis of IPF:Inflammatory Fibrosis Theory &#8594; the prevailing hypothesis.Inflammation leads to fibrosis.Abnormal Wound Healing Model &#8594; this is the modern theory, and is still evolving.Epithelial injury leads to fibrosis.1. The Inflammatory Fibrosis TheoryAlveolitisNormally, we have Type I cells (flat) that line the alveolar walls, and Type II cells that produce surfactant.Within the airspace, there are usually only a few macrophages.When there is alveolitis, there is an accumulation of inflammatory cells within the airspace &#8594; macrophages and neutrophils.In IPF, this accumulation is due to unknown reasons.These lead to the release of cytokines.Parenchymal &#38; Connective Tissue AlterationMediators released by the inflammatory cells cause alterations in the parenchyma and connective tissue.FibrosisHoneycombingBecause the prevailing theory is that IPF is mediated by inflammation, the prevailing treatment has been steroids (eg. prednisone).Recently, because of the increasing popularity of the abnormal wound-healing model, there have been changes to this thought.2. The Abnormal Wound Healing TheoryThis is the more modern theory as to the etiology of IPF.Multiple micro-injuries (unknown cause)Alveolar epithelial cell damage and activationThis is the primary event.Fibroblast migration and proliferation occurs, causing a phenotypic change to the myofibroblasts.Basement membrane disruption and angiogenesisAbsent of delayed apoptosis and re-epithelializationFibrosis &#38; HoneycombingNote that here, we have no inflammatory cells.In the context of the abnormal wound-healing model, the treatment would be focused on adressing alveolar epithelial cell damageWhen to Biopsy?IPF can be clinically diagnosed with a high degree of certainty &#8594; 80-90% of the time.In patients with atypical symptoms or radiological features, definitive diagnosis is by surgical lung biopsy (Gold Standard).Pathology of IPFUsual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) describes the spectrum of features we would see in IPF, and other fibrotic lung diseases.Location: bilateral, lower lobes, sub-pleural/peripheral.Patchy, heterogeneous inflammatory/fibrosing interstitial process.This patchwork means that some parts of the lung will be normal, and some will be abnormal.Honeycombing will be presentHere we see histological images of the heterogeneous pattern of normal and fibrotic alveoli with UIP.Late stage IPF on autopsy. The patient died of complications following cor pulmonale secondary to their IPF.SarcoidosisClinical Aspects of SarcoidosisPresentationConstitutional complaints very commonAnorexia, malaise, low grade fever, etc.Often very similar to a flu-like illness.We suspect that many people get this disease acutely, and then get better. The cases of sarcoidosis we see are the small subset of people that do not get better.The thorax is involved in &#62;90% of cases but chest exam may be normal!Associated splenomegaly &#38; peripheral lymphadenopathy is common.Can present to any sub-specialist!Presents in much younger populations compared to other fibrotic lung disorders.Pulmonary Features of SarcoidosisLofgren&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; most common, but the least worrisome.Erythema nodosum &#8594; raised red rash, typically on the shins.Classic presentation &#8594; if you see a young patient who presents with a rash like this that has been tender for the past few weeks, the next order is typically a CXR.If you see bilateral hilar lympadenopathy (BHL), as well, then it&#8217;s sarcoidosis.Most patients like this will get better with no treatment over time. Sometimes, we give them NSAIDs to reduce pain.We tend to get involved in patients that progress more, and have DILD, with the classic progressive dyspneaThey will have characteristic radiographic findings that will separate them from IPF.For instance, if fibrosis occurs with Sarcoidosis, it&#8217;ll generally be in the upper lung zones.There will also be multiple extrapulmonary manifestations.RememberLofgren&#8217;s Syndrome = Erythema nodosum + Bilateral Hilar Lympadenopathy.RememberFibrosis due to sarcoidosis &#8594; upper lung zones.Fibrosis due to IPF &#8594; basal and cortical regions.Extrapulmonary Features of SarcoidosisSkinErythema nodosum &#8594; just a nuisance.Lupus pernio &#8594; invasive and disfiguring.Eye &#8594; uveitis, which can make you blindUveitis is where you have inflammation the uvea.It must be treated promptly with steroids.HypercalcemiaLiver &#8594; Granulomatous hepatitis.Almost always involved, but usually not damaged.This makes it a very useful place to take a biopsy to look for non-caseating granulomas &#8594; pathognomonic for sarcoidosis!Joints &#8594; Peripheral pauci-articular arthritisThis means that you&#8217;ll have arthritis a few joints at a time.Cardiac &#8594; esp. arrhythmias, heart blockThese are very serious, and are rarely seen.This seems to be more common in black patients.CNS &#8594; cranial neuropathies, brainstem infiltratesThese are also very serious.RememberNon-caseating granulomas = SarcoidosisErythema nodosum involves the subcutaneous tissue, so panniculitus (inflammation of the subcutaneous fat) occurs. These are actually not due to the formation of granulomas &rarr; erythema nodosum can appear in many other diseases. On the other hand, lupus pernio is due to sarcoidal granulas in the dermis.Radiographic Stages in SarcoidosisThis is a bit of a misnomer &#8594; stages suggest progression from one stage to the next, but this isn&#8217;t true in this case.This refers to a radiographic classification, not a physiological progression.Stage 1 &#8594; Bilateral hilar &#38; mediastinal lympadenopathy with no infiltrates.Stage 2 &#8594; BHL + lung infiltrates.Stage 3 &#8594; lung infiltrates only.(Stage 4) &#8594; end-stage upper lobe fibrosis. Only sometimes mentioned.Radiographic Stages in SarcoidosisStage I &#8594; lympadenopathy only.Stage II &#8594; lympadenopathy + pulmonary infiltratesStage III &#8594; pulmonary infiltrates only.Stage IV &#8594; upper-lobe fibrosis.This is a CXR of a Stage I Sarcoidosis.We shouldn&#8217;t have the curved opacity above the left-heart border.This is suggestive of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.We also see hilar lympadenopathy because the region where the pulmonary artery should be is too big.This takes some experience to see!Lab AbnormalitiesCommon &#8594; mild elevation of liver enzymes (since the liver is often involved).Hypergammaglobinemia because the immune system is turned one.Sarcoid granulomas actually produce angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)!Uncommon &#8594; hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia.Activated 1a-hydroxylase &#8594; converts inactive to active vitamin D.If you have hypercalcemia with no obvious cause, you would have sarcoidosis in your DDx, especially since it&#8217;s iminently treatable.PrognosisMajory of patients are asymptomatic or have self-limited disease that requires no treatment.Less than 10% actually require Rx. for severe symptoms and/or life threatening disease.TreatmentTreatment must be individualized to the patient, presentation, and disease severity.Typically we use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy.Prednisone is used for severe symptoms or major organ involvementmust treat uveitis, hypercalcemia &amp; CNS or cardiac involvement.The role of steroids in various types/stages of lung involvement is less clear. It may delay it, but doesn&#8217;t prevent it.Treatment of SarcoidosisTypically, NSAIDS are used.For patients with severe symptoms/end organ involvement, Prednisone is used.You must use prednisone with:UveitisHypercalcemiaCNS or Cardiac involvementPathology of SarcoidosisSarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in many organs.It&#8217;s more common than IPF, presents in younger populations, and is more treatable. (IPF has a much poorer prognosis)Unlike IPF, pathology plays a big role in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.The mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are most commonly affected.These nodes, along with the lungs, are the major regions where sarcoidosis is involved.Lymphadenopathy will often be seen before diffuse infiltrates, as we saw previously with our radiographic staging of Sarcoidosis.The uveal tract is affected sometimes as well (uveitis)Pathogenesis of SarcoidosisSarcoidosis is a disease of disordered immune regulationThe current thinking is that three events are needed:Exposure to some kind of antigen (antigen still not yet known).Acquired cell-mediated T-cell response.CD4+ T-helper cells drive a chronic immunologic response &#8594; granulomasWe suspect there is some degree of genetic susceptibility, due to familial and racial differences in incidence.Pathological Features of SarcoidosisT-helper cells increased at tissue levelCD4+/CD8+ ratio = 10:1T-helper cells decreased in peripheral bloodCD4+/CD8+ ratio = 0.8:1 (normal 2:1)T-helper cells in tissue assist in formation of granulomas (through cytokines and macrophage activation).Granulomas produce angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Lab test).There is Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia due to T-helper cell dysregulation.The role of BiopsySarcoidosis is a clinicopathologic diagnosis.So a biopsy is essential for diagnosis.The most common type of biopsy is a transbronchial lung biopsy.Sometimes we do a mediastinoscopy, with a mini-thoracotomy, and a mediastinal scope. This is done less often because it&#8217;s more invasive.Lymph node biopsies, liver core biopsies, salivary gland biopsies, etc, can also be done, depending on which tissues are involved.Non-Caseating GranulomasGranuloma = collection of inflammatory cellsMacrophages become Epitheloid Cells (1).These can join together to become Multinucleated Giant Cells (2).CD4+ T-helper cells will be present in the centre (3), and help in forming the granuloma.Some CD8+ cells and B cells will be seen on the periphery (4)non-caseating = no necrosis in the centre of the granuloma.Distribution of Granulomas in SarcoidosisGranulomas will be located near the bronchovascular bundles, in the interlobular septa, and in the subpleural region.This pattern of distribution is known as a lymphatic pattern, with respect to the lung interstitium.This is why transbronchial biopsies are so effective in diagnosing sarcoidosis &#8594; there will generally be non-caseating granulomas near the bronchovascular bundles.Granulomas will resolve via fibrosis.Depending on the density of the granulomas, interstitial fibrosis and honeycombing may occur (in 5-15% of cases).Differential for SarcoidosisInfectionMycobacterial &#8594; TuberculosisFungalBerylliosis &#8594; beryllium exposure can also produce a granulomatous reaction.We usually do an acid fast and fungal stain on tissue, before we suggest the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in a biopsy (eliminate mycobacterial and funal etiologies).Hypersensitivity PneumonitisHypersensitivity pneumonitis is more accurately referred to as extrinsic allergic alveolitis.It&#8217;s a complex pulmonary immune response to an inhaled organic antigen.The onset may be insidious with delayed symptoms.Thousands of exposures have been incrimated.As we&#8217;ve said before, the big three are:Hypersensitivity PneumonitisBird-fanciersFarmer&#8217;s lungHumidifier LungAll kinds of things can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis!Diagnosing Hypersensitivity PneumonitisCareful exposure history (work, hobbies, travel)Can measure circulating antibodies to known antigens. However, this is non-specificIf you see antibodies expected in farmer&#8217;s lung, all that&#8217;ll tell you is that the patient is a farmer!But with CXR results, and symptoms, this is more helpful!We rarely do a controlled exposure, because the immune response can be pretty serious.TreatmentAvoidance!In cases where there is severe disease, steroids may be used.Drug Induced DILDReactions can be acute, but can also be delayed or even insidious (especially with chronic treatment).We can have dose-related toxicity (bleomycin) or an idiosyncratic reaction (amiodarone).Drug-induced DILDNitrofurantoinChemotherapy &#8594; eg. Bleomycin.DMARDS &#8594; eg. Gold, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.AmiodaronePneumoconiosisAsbestosis = interstitial lung disease due to asbestos.But asbestos can cause other things &#8594; pleural plaques (thickening and calcification of the pleural surface).With Asbestos exposure, we have different presentations depending on the dose-response and latency.Short latency: pleural effusion.High dose: asbestosis.Low dose &#38; long latency: mesothelioma.The problem with asbestos related diseases is that the exposure invariably happens a long time ago, which makes taking the history difficult.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/05/clinical-aspects-pathology-interstitial-lung-diseases.html"},

It&#8217;s the hollow muscular organ that holds the vocal cords.The left vocal cord and the right vocal cord are shown.There are also vocal cord nodules, which are circled in red.Vocal cord nodules are typically benign, and treated with voice therapy.You can see the tracheal rings past the vocal cords, which is part of the lower airway.Hence one of the functions of the larynx is to protect the lower airway.The image on the right shows a case of early laryngeal cancer.In this case, the patient needed a tracheostomy.CartilagesThe thyroid cartilage is what we know as the adam&#8217;s apple.Below that is the cricoid cartilage, which is a ring. - From the back of the cricoid cartilage, it looks like a signet ring.The arytenoids are flaps from the back where most of the muscles of the larynx and vocal cords attach.Hence, your arytenoids are very important for speech.The epiglottis closes automatically when you swallow to protect your airways. It looks like a floppy toilet seat.There are muscles that attach to the epiglottis that help it flap over the trachea.There&#8217;s a membrane gap between the thyroid and the crichoid &#8594; this is known as the crichothyroid membrane.This was seen in the movie The Heat where they perform a cricothyrotomy.A cricothyrotomy is used as a last resort method to establish a patent airway.When you move the arytenoids, you can move the vocal cords.Lengthen vocal cords &#8594; narrow cords &#8594; increase pitch.Shorten vocal cords &#8594; thick cords &#8594; decrease pitch.NervesRecurrent laryngeal nerve &#8594; branches off the vagus and reflects off the either the aortic arch and ligamentum arteriosum (left recurrent laryngeal), or the right subclavian artery (right recurrent laryngeal).The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the intrinsic muscles, except for the cricothyroid muscle.As a result, damage to the recurrent laryngeal can cause vocal cord paralysis on the side that is damaged.The thyroid gland is wrapped around the trachea like an H.The left recurrent laryngeal hides beneath the thyroid somewhere, so you have to be careful working with the thyroid to avoid damaging it.The FaceThe parotid gland lies above the masseter, beneath the ear.The branches of the facial nerve splay out underneath it.There are 3 major salivary glands, and a bunch of minor salivary glands:Parotid salivary glands.Sublingual salivary glands.Submandibular salivary glands.Generally, when we do a differential, we use a template:Is is congenital or acquired? Infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic? If it&#8217;s neoplastic, benign or malignant?When we&#8217;re dealing with parotid tumours, we have to be careful because you have to find and save the facial nerve, in order to avoid Bell&#8217;s palsy.The facial nerve is very small, and branches off in many directions, so this is often a very tricky operation.Sometimes, facial nerve paralysis can prevent eye closure at night. This is a medical emergency, and is an opthalmic problem, as it may lead to blindless.The facial nerve travels through a hole in the bottom of the skull called the stylomastoid foramen.This is right beside the temporomandibular joint, where the jaw attaches.The facial nerve lies under the parotid, and splits into 5 branches:TemporalZygomaticBuccalMandibularCervicalThese can be remembered by the To Zanzibar By Motor Car mnemonic.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/03/head-neck-anatomy-1.html"},
	{"title": "Physiology of Ventilation &amp; Perfusion", "text": "The overall matching of ventilation to perfusion is not perfect, even in the healthy person. For example, in the upright position, both blood flow and alveolar ventilation are less in the upper versus the lower lung zones. This is due to the effect of gravity.Lecture OutlineConcept of ventilation-perfusion matchingCauses of hypoxemia.Causes of hypercarbia.Ventilation-Perfusion MatchingReviewThe alveolar air equation determines our PO2.The alveolar ventilation equation determines our PCO2.The Alveolar Ventilation Equation$$ P_ACO_2 \propto \frac{\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{\dot{V}_A}$$The Alveolar Air Equation$$ P_AO_2 = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}$$When we hyperventilate or hypoventilate, the partial pressures of O2 and CO2 changes as shown in the chart. These differences can be determined from our two equations.The normal alveolar minute ventilation is 4.2 L/min, but the total minute ventilation is around 6 L/min!This is because of the presence of dead space.The normal arterial PaO2 is 95 mmHg.The normal arterial PaCO2 is 40 mmHg.Regional Changes in Ventilation &#38; PerfusionRegional VentilationThe lung is like a spring. If you hang a spring, it&#8217;ll be more stretched at the top than at the bottom. The same applies for the lungs!As a result, ventilation will favour the bottom of the lung.Regional PerfusionBecause of gravity, most of the perfusion is at the bases of the lung as well.This was seen previously, when West Zones were discussed.As a result, perfusion will favour the bottom of the lung.Ventilation and PerfusionFrom the above, we see that ventilation and perfusion will both increase as we move down the lung.However, the rate at which they change is not the same &#8594; gravity has different effects on blood flow and ventilation.This means that the ventilation-perfusion ratio actually falls as we move down the lung.Near the top of the lung, the ventilation is greater than the perfusion, so the V/Q ratio is greater than 1.Near the bottom of the lung, the ventilation is less than the perfusion, so the V/Q ratio is less than 1.This actually affects the alveolar gases in these areas.At the apex of the lung, since we have more ventilation to perfusion, there is less gas exchanged into the alveolar space.At the base of the lung, since we have perfusion to ventilation, there is more gas exchanged into the alveolar space.This means that:At the apex, PAO2&#8593; and PACO2&#8595; &#8594; less gas exchange, so it&#8217;ll look more like inspired air.At the base, PAO2&#8595; and PACO2&#8593; &#8594; more gas exchange.This can be visualized as an O2-CO2 line for the upright lung.This compares the partial pressures of CO2 and O2 at different heights of the lung.As expected:At the apex of the lung, we&#8217;ll have a high PO2, and a low PCO2.At the base of the lung, we&#8217;ll have a low PO2, and a high PCO2.Extreme Ventilation Perfusion RatiosIf a region is perfused but not ventilated, it&#8217;s called shunt.If a region is ventilated but not perfused, it&#8217;s called dead space.Recall that oxygen is much less diffusible than carbon dioxide, so it's more sensitive to changes in ventilation or diffusion.The A-a gradient is a good way to quantify the V/Q mismatch, because it should be smaller with a better ventilation-perfusion match.Shunt vs Dead SpaceShunt = perfusion but no ventilation.Dead Space = ventilation but no perfusion.Causes of HypoxemiaPotential Causes of Tissue HypoxiaHypoxemic hypoxia &#8594; what we&#8217;ll be talking about today.reduction of inspired PO2alveolar hypoventilationventilation-perfusion mismatchshuntAnemic hypoxia &#8594; if you have low Hb, you won&#8217;t be effectively able to transport oxygen to tissue.decreased actual hemoglobindecreased functional hemoglobinHypoperfusion hypoxia &#8594; if the tissues are poorly perfused, it doesn&#8217;t matter how well oxygenated your blood is.decreased systemic or local blood flowHistotoxic hypoxia &#8594; if our oxidative pathways are affected, then we can cause hypoxia downstream.cyanide poisoningCauses of Hypoxemic Hypoxia1.

Assume that you reduce your PaCO2 (hyperventilate) to 32 mm Hg and that your P(A-a)O2 = 5 mm Hg (that is, your lung’s are normal).$$\begin{align}	P_AO_2 &amp; = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}\\	&amp; = (0.21 \times (550 - 47)) - \frac{32}{0.8}\\	&amp; = 105.63 - 40 \\	&amp; = 66 \text { mmHg}\end{align}$$To get your PaO2, we just subtract the gradient, so it would be 61 mmHg.At 61 mmHg, this is around the steep part of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, so this is bad!2. Hypoxemia due to Alveolar HypoventilationQuestionYou may see hypoxemia associated with alveolar hypoventilationin the emergency department. For example, a drug overdose with a sedating drug may depress ventilation. The arterial blood gases, on room air, in this situation show a PaO2 of 45 mmHg and a PaCO2 of 80 mmHg. Calculate the P(A-a)O2?$$\begin{align}	P_AO_2 &amp; = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}\\	&amp; = (0.21 \times (760 - 47)) - \frac{80}{0.8}\\	&amp; = 149.73 - 100 \\	&amp; = 50 \text { mmHg}\end{align}$$The PaO2 is 45 mmHg, so there must be a gradient of 5 mmHg.Here, we see that the PAO2 decreased because of an increase in the PACO2, caused by hypoventilation.3. Hypoxemia due to V/Q mismatchHypoxemia can occur because of poor ventilation-perfusion matching, because in regions with a low V/Q ratio, the blood will be under-ventilated with respect to perfusion!Even though regions with a high V/Q ratio compensate for this with a high oxygen saturation, this will be a smaller contribution because these regions are relatively less perfused!For instance, in chronic bronchitis, regional airway obstruction causes distal bronchioles to have a low V/Q ratio.In emphysema, alveolar wall destruction reduces surface area, which also causes a low V/Q ratio.In a pulmonary embolism, flow is blocked in one area, creating alveolar dead space (V/Q = &#8734;), and increases in another area, since the flow has to go somewhere (V/Q &#8595;).QuestionWhy is the PaCO2 low in the patient with the pulmonary embolus? Doesn’t increased VA/Q &#8216;scatter&#8217; also reduce CO2 elimination?AnswerIncreased VA/Q &#8216;scatter&#8217; reduces both O2 uptake and CO2 elimination and the lung becomes less efficient as a gas exchanger. However, central chemoreceptors sense the rising P2CO2 and consequently increase overall minute ventilation to return the P2CO2 back to normal (or sometimes, even lower than normal)! This also helps your PO2 compensate, but not completely, since oxygen is less diffusible (recall the Gas Diffusion lecture).4. Hypoxemia due to ShuntShunt is an extreme case, where we have perfusion but no ventilation.One example is a mucus plug sitting in the right lung, completely occluding the right main-stem bronchi.The right lung then collapses, showing an opacified silhouette on CXR. There will be dullness upon percussion.Upon removal of the plug, the lung returns to normal.Since we have no ventilation, but perfusion, for the right lung, this is shunt!Causes of HypercarbiaAbnormalities in ventilatory control leading to alveolar hypoventilation.Severe VA/Q mismatch with mechanical insufficiency.1. Abnormalities in Ventilatory ControlThis makes sense, recalling the alveolar ventilation equation:$$ P_ACO_2 \propto \frac{\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{\dot{V}_A}$$If you reduce the alveolar minute ventilation, then the \(P_ACO_2\) will increase!The name of Ondine's Curse is inspired by the myth of Ondine, a water nymph who had an unfaithful mortal lover. The lover swore to her that 'every waking breath would be a testimony of my love'. He cheated on her, she found out, and cursed him to forget to breathe if he ever fell asleep!For instance, something that affects the pons or the medulla, can affect our central chemoreceptors, as discussed previously.This can cause an impaired hypercapnic ventilatory drive!One example is patient that had a neuroblastoma in the medulla, which had to be resected.After the surgery, he was left with Ondine&#8217;s Curse.Ondine&#8217;s Curse &#8594; you cannot breathe properly when you sleep, because you depend on your ventilatory control of breathing.So in this case, the patient had to go on a breathing machine when he was sleeping.2. Severe V/Q Mismatch and Mechanical InsufficiencyEven if you have normal ventilatory control, if you have a severe V/Q mismatch, then you cannot physically ventilate enough to compensate!This can be exacerbated if you have a neuromuscular problem that weakens your respiratory muscles!The Ultimate V/Q MismatchHere is a patient with a massive pulmonary embolus, occluding the right pulmonary artery.When you pushed a intubation tube too far, it'll generally go to the right main stem bronchus, because it's more direct because of the curvature of the bronchi.This patient had obstructive shock, so the emergency team had to rapidly intubate the patient.But when the patient was initially intubated, the tube was pushed too far, and it entered the right main stem bronchus.This caused them to only ventilate the right lung (see CXR).The right side of the lung was then ventilated but not perfused &#8594; dead space.The left side of the lung was then perfused but not ventilated &#8594; shunt.This is an extreme &#8594; complete uncoupling of ventilation and perfusion!This doesn&#8217;t have to occur at the lung level, it can occur at an alveolar level as well!For instance, pulmonary edema causing collapse of alveoli, leading to shunt areas.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/03/ventilation-perfusion-physiology.html"},
	{"title": "Mechanics of Respiration", "text": "Contraction of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles causes the thoracic cage to expand (above FRC) and lower the pressure within the pleural space surrounding the lungs. Consequently the distensible lungs expand and the pressure decreases within the alveolar ducts and alveoli, resulting in fresh gas to flow down the branching airways to the alveoli.Lecture OutlineRespiratory musclesElastic properties of the respiratory systemFlow resistance of the respiratory systemWork of breathingForced Expiratory ManeuverRespiratory MusclesFor inspiratory airflow to occur, the respiratory system, which consists of the lungs and chest wall, must expand above its resting volume, the functional residual capacity (FRC).To have this expansion, we must overcome two types of opposing forces intrinsic to the respiratory system:Elastic Recoil (Pel)Flow Resistance (Pfr)One analogy for the respiratory system is a balloon in a box.Here, we have a balloon in a box, and by having a vacuum connected to the box, we can reduce the external pressure around the balloon.This causes changes in the balloon&#8217;s volume.In the case of our actual lungs, this vacuum is replaced with a diaphragm which pulls down to create the negative pressure.The fibres of the diaphragm circumferentially insert into the bottom of the rib cage, so that when it contracts, it&#8217;ll push down on the belly.The belly then pushes back and acts like a fulcrum to lift the ribs upwards, just like the handles of a bucket.This is important when you breathe in, because it allows the rib cage to open outwards.Muscles of InspirationExternal intercostal muscles between the ribs lift them up.They sort of work like blinds, in that each muscle raises the rib below it.The external intercostals are innervated from T1-T12.The Diaphragm is innervated by C3-C5C3, 4, &#38; 5 keeps the diaphragm alive.When the diaphragm is impaired, or you&#8217;re breathing under strain, the scalenes and sternomastoids are involved.The scalenes and sternomastoids actually function to lift the entire rib cage up.Clinical Note 1The accessory muscles of inspiration are generally inactive during quiet breathing at rest, but become active in disease states where the work of breathing is great, e.g., acute asthma or where ventilatory demands are high, e.g., exertion.Clinical Note 2If the diaphragms are paralyzed, they are passive and move upward on inspiration in response to a decreased intrathoracic pressure caused by the action of the other respiratory muscles. In this situation the abdominal cavity moves inwards on inspiration, an abnormal condition known as &#8216;upper abdominal inspiratory paradox&#8217;.Muscles of ExpirationThere are also muscles of expiration.Generally, expiration occurs passively, but it can occur actively when under strain.The most important expiratory muscles are the abdominal musclesThe internal intercostals actually work to help collapse down the rib.Coughing and clearing secretions also requires the the expiratory. muscles (this is not passive)Summary of Respiratory MusclesInspiratory MusclesThe diaphragm, which is innervated by C3-C5, is the primary muscle of inspiration.External intercostals help pull the ribs up, and they&#8217;re innervated by T1-T12.Scalenes and Sternomastoids play a role when you&#8217;re breathing under strain or your diaphragm is impaired &#8594; accessory muscles of inspiration.Expiratory MusclesGenerally occurs passively.Active expiration relies mainly on the abdominal muscles, innervated by T7-T12.The internal intercostals help collapse the ribs.QuestionThe abdominal muscles are extremely important for an effective cough. What happens to the inspiratory muscles and to the ability to cough when a person completely severs the lower cervical spine (at C6)?Since the diaphragm is innervated by C3-C5, it&#8217;ll function normally, so inspiration will be okay.However, since coughing requires active expiration, which involves the abdominal muscles, it&#8217;ll be affected!Since the abdominal muscles are innervated by T7-T12, they&#8217;re below the lesion.This means that coughing wil be impaired.Elastic CharacteristicsElastanceThe lung is an elastic structure returns to its resting volume after distension.Because of this, any extension past the resting volume requires a force to distend the lung.This force can be quantified as the trans-lung pressure, the pressure difference between the alveolar pressure and the intrapleural pressure.This is \(P_{alv} - P_{pl}\).This is the pressure inside minus the pressure outside.Intuitively, this makes sense &#8594; if the pressure inside is greater than the pressure outside, than the lung will stretch.If not, then the lung will collapse.Trans-lung Pressure$$ P_{tl} = P_{alv} - P_{pl} $$ComplianceCompliance is the opposite of elastance. This refers to how stiff the lung is.More formally, it refers to how much the volume of the lung changes with respect to a change in pressure &#8594; The more the volume changes for a given change in pressure, the more compliant it is.This is calculated as:Compliance$$ C_L = \Delta V/\Delta P $$Pressure Volume Curves of the LungThe figure above shows an experiment where we put a lung in a bottle, and hook it up to a spirometer.We can vary the pressure within the bottle, to change the trans-lung pressure.This lets us assess the elastic properties of the lung, namely the compliance.NotesThis is a static maneuver &#8594; we make a change, wait for the system to stabilize, and then measure the results.In other words, the elastic properties of the lungs are measured when there is no airflow, so this is a static maneuver.We arbitrarily assign the atmospheric pressure = 0, as a reference point. So, since since the airways are open to the atmosphere, \( P_{alv} = 0 \).This means that when the lung is inflating, the trans-lung pressure = \(P_{alv} - P_{pl}\) must be positive.But since the alveolar pressure is zero, this means that the intrapleural presure is negative.Note that the inspiratory pressure-volume curve is different from the expiratory pressure-volume curve &#8594; this is called hysteresis.Generally, Hysteresis is the dependence of a system not only on its current environment, but also on its past environment.Here, this system demonstrates hysteresis, because for the same pressures, we have different volumes, depending on if the lung is inflating or deflating.The pressure-volume curve lets us determine the compliance of the lung.Since compliance is assessed as \( C_L = \Delta V/\Delta P \), we can obtain it from the slope of the curve!The work of breathing changes depending on the volume.Since compliance increases the closer we get to TLC, it gets harder to breathe near the top of the curve.Clinical Note 3In emphysema, there is destruction of the alveolar walls with a reduction and enlargement of the alveolar air spaces. This destruction results in loss of lung recoil. This makes the lung more compliant (&#8593;CL).In diffuse interstitial fibrosis excess connective tissue accumulates within the interstitium of the lung. Therefore, the lung is more difficult to distend, and is less compliant (&#8595;CL).Measurement of Lung ComplianceWe can also measure lung compliance in a living person, although this is somewhat involved.Since this is pretty invasive, it&#8217;s rarely done.We put a tube down the esophagus, and try to use the intrathoracic pressure to estimate the pleural pressure.What determines Elastic Recoil?The elastic recoil of the lung arises from two components:The tissue forces (elastic properties of the lung parenchyma).The surface forces (surface tension at the alveolar interface).These forces act to collapse the lungs back to their resting volume.1/3 of the total recoil is due to the tissue forces.This is from the inherent elasticity of the lung parenchyma due to networks of collagen and elastic fibres.2/3 of the total recoil is due to the surface tension.This is produced by a thin film of liquid covering the alveolar surface, promoting alveolar collapse.Why does Hysteresis Occur?To the right, we see pressure-volume curves for air versus saline.Note that for the pressure volume curve with saline, we do not see any hysteresis!The reason for this is because we don&#8217;t have the effect of fluid surface tension any more.Normally, during inspiration, you need to overcome the surface tension in the lungs.So, when you&#8217;re breathing in, you have an immediate increase in pressure, but the volume will not immediately increase because it must overcome the resisting force of the surface tension &#8594; this gives you the flat part.After this is overcome, the volume increases proportionally to pressure, until we get closer to the total lung capacity, and the elastic properties of the lung parenchyma start to kick in.When you are breathing out, the surface tension is working &#8216;with you&#8217;, so it makes the lung more compliant.In a saline environment, we don&#8217;t have this difference, so don&#8217;t have any hysteresis.Pulmonary SurfactantPulmonary surfactant, which is produced by type II cells within the alveolar space, is a phospholipid that modulates surface tension forces.This surfactant moderates the effects of surface tension by acting more when the surface area is smaller, and acting less the surface area is larger.When the volume is small, the lipid tails are close together, cauging them to aggregate. As a result, water cannot associate, and surface tension cannot develop.When the volume is large, the lipid tails are far apart, so water tension can develop, increasing recoil.Surfactant has the following physiological roles.Surfactant prevents smaller alveoli from collapsing by weakening the effects of water tension!Increases lung compliance by reducing the effects of water tension. This reduces negative pressure in the pleural space, dropping the hydrostatic gradient, and reducing flow from the vascular bed.Type I Cells vs Type II CellsType I Cells are epithelial cells &#8594; they line the alveolus.Type II Cells are scattered across the alveolar wall, and produce surfactant.Clinical Note 4At birth , when the fetus takes the first breath, the lungs go from water-filled to air-filled.When you&#8217;re born prematurely, oftentimes you haven&#8217;t developed enough surfactant.As a result, the water tension will be very high, and the lung may collapse.To treat this we either support the breathing or provide external surfactant.A combined pressure-volume curve integrating the chest wall and the lungs.The chest wall has elastic characteristics as well.So when we&#8217;re dealing with the entire respiratory system, we have a combined pressure volume curve where the lungs and chest wall are yoked together.This can be seen in the figure above, where the chest wall curve and the lung curve are the dotted lines, and the combined curve is solid.If the two are uncoupled, then the lung will collapse, and the chest wall will expand, as seen above (demarcated by the red circles).When they&#8217;re coupled, their compromise gives your the resting respiratory level, which is the FRC.Clinical Note 5A pneumothorax, which is often caused by a knife wound, uncouples the lung from the chest wall.As a result, the lung collapses, and the chest wall expands.A pneumothorax is air in the pleural space.This balance between the chest PVC and the lung PVC is shifted in some pathologies:With emphysema, because there&#8217;s alveolar wall damage, there is a reduction in elastic recoil, so the balance will tilt towards the chest wall PVC &#8594; the chest wall will expand.With pulmonary fibrosis, the lungs are less compliant, so the balance will tilt towards the lung PVC &#8594; the chest wall will be pulled back.Flow ResistanceIn static conditions, where there&#8217;s no flow, we only require pressure to oppose the elastic recoil and maintain lung volumes.However, when we&#8217;re breathing in and out, we also need additional pressure to overcome the resistance of the airways.Airway ResistanceAirway Resistance, \(R_{aw}\), is caused by friction between gas molecules and the airway walls.This means that it is affected by geometric properties of the airways:Diameter &#8594; resistance decreases with increased diameter.Length &#8594; resistance increases with increased length.Cross sectional area &#8594; resistance decreases with increased cross sectional area.This is conceptually similar to Poiseulle's Law, which we saw in Heart &#38; Circulation.This means that the resistance is not uniform throughout the airways.The trumpet model of the pulmonary airways is a good way to visualize this.The mouth of the trumpet represents the trachea, the neck the lobar bronchi, and the exit would be the peripheral bronchioles.Since the cross-sectional area increases further down, the total resistance falls.This means that the resistance is higher in the upper airways, and lower in the lower airways.RememberResistance is higher in the upper airways and lower in the lower airways.Measurement of Airway ResistanceWe can directly calculate \(R_{aw}\) using the following equation, arising from the fact that \( R = P/F \):Airway Resistance$$ R_{aw} = \frac{P_{alv} - P_{ao}}{\dot{V}} $$Corollaries of the Trumpet ModelIf we have a disease process that affects the upper airway, we don&#8217;t need as significant an effect to have an impediment to flow.An example of a disease that affects the upper airways is Wegner&#8217;s Granulomatosis, which scars the airways.If we have a disease process that affects the lower airway, we need a greater effect to affect flow.An example of a disease that affects the lower airways would be any of the obstructive lung diseases &#8594; chronic bronchitis, acute asthma, and emphysema.This is because the resistance is higher in the upper airways, making it more suspectible to an obstruction in flow (\( F = P/R \))Airway Resistance and Lung VolumeAirway resistance varies with lung volume:At the TLC, airways have been pushed open, we have less airway resistance.At the RV, since the non-cartiliginous airways are closed due to low intraluminal pressure, there is more airway resistance.Work of breathingWork is minimal at the FRC.This makes sense physiologically &#8594; you would want your resting volume to be the point where work is the lowest.The shape of the curve is due to a balance between frictional and elastic forces (friction = airway resistance).Near the TLC, there&#8217;s lots of elastic force, but not much frictional force.Near the RV, there&#8217;s lots of frictional force, but not much elastic force.The compromise between the two gives us our FRC.This also means that your FRC will change if we have shifts in the elastic force or the airway resistance.Forced Expiratory ManeuverThe Forced Expiratory Maneuver is where a subject inhales fully to their total lung capacity, and then exhales as hard as possible, for as long as possible. (reaching their RV).One of the most widely used and standardized tests of lung function.By recording the flow rates at different points in time, we can obtain a maximum expiratory flow-volume curve.FVC = Forced Vital Capacity.FEV1 = Forced Expiratory Volume after 1 secondNormal FEV1/FVC = 0.8Over the rising part of the flow-volume curve, the expiratory flow is effort dependent because you can increase the extrapleural pressure to increase the expiratory flow rate.Later on, the expiratory flow is effort independent, because the rate limiting factor is the actual airway diameter, and these airways can dynamically collapse with reduced intraluminal pressures.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/03/03/mechanics-respiration.html"},

He has smoked two packs a day for forty five years (90 pack years). As a consequence he has had moderately severe emphysema for several years. While breathing room air he is hypoxemic. On physical examination he has clinical signs consistent with pulmonary hypertension and this is confirmed with echocardiography.Pulmonary HypertensionPulmonary Hypertension &#8594; mean pulmonary artery pressure of &#62;20 mmHg, or &#62;25 mmHg. (depending on the source).Traditionally it was difficult to assess (involved catheterization), but is now easier to assess because we can do it with echocardiography.Strongest predictor of mortality in patients with COPD.In patients with COPD, secondary pulmonary hypertension develops gradually.Usually patients will only have a modest elevation, versus patients with primary pulmonary hypertension.What are the possible mechanisms of his pulmonary hypertension?    The Pulmonary Artery Pressure    $$P_{pa} = (CO \times PVR) + P_{pv}$$As we saw in class, an increase in pulmonary artery pressure can be caused by:Increased pulmonary blood flow.Increased pulmonary venous pressure.Increased pulmonary vascular resistance.It&#8217;s the third that causes the pulmonary hypertension here.Chronic hypoxia causes vasoconstriction that increases vascular resistance.In emphysema, we have a reduced surface area for gas exchange, which causes this hypoxia.Note that hypoxic vasoconstriction is the opposite of what happens in most tissues.Typically, we have hypoxic vasodilation, where hypoxia results in increased perfusion.This makes sense systemically, as you want to better perfuse areas that are potentially ischemic.Acutely, this is reversible, but chronic alveolar hypoxia seems to have permanent effects:Endothelial dysfunction &#8594; decrease in release of eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase), and as we saw in Heart &#38; Circulation, Nitric Oxide is a strong vasodilator.Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling &#8594; muscularization of pulmonary arterioles.What therapies would be possible to treat his pulmonary hypertension?Smoking Cessation &#8594; might be tough in someone who&#8217;s smoked 2 packs a day for 45 years.Long-term Oxygen Therapy &#8594; shown to increase survival in patients with pulmonary hypertension and COPD.Lung volume reduction &#8594; won&#8217;t help with the hypertension, but helps in patients with gas-trapping.Lung transplant &#8594; good option for younger patients (&#60; 65 y/o).Diuretics &#8594; sometimes used, although this isn&#8217;t really a volume overload problem.

Recall that they inhibits breakdown of cGMP, which is what mediates vasodilation via NO.Vasodilators (inhaled NO, CCBs)Although they do reduce pulmonary hypertension, by reducing the hypoxic vasoconstriction, they also affect the V/Q matching that this hypoxic vasoconstriction helps with!So these vasodilators impair gas exchange!They&#8217;re life-saving drugs in young patients with primary hypertension, but they&#8217;re absolutely contraindicated in patients with secondary hypertension.Case #2Case DescriptionMr. John GourleyMr. Gourley is a 70 year old man who has smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for 50 years and has moderately severe emphysema.

Pretty aggressive, so there&#8217;s a high mortality rate.Vaccination/Abx for prophylaxis.NotesThe \( P_ACO_2 \) only rises in extreme circumstances, because the hypoxic ventilatory drive causes hyperventilation, and CO2 is very diffusible!So although the following would make sense given the reduced surface area for gas exchange, they&#8217;re not observed due to diffusibility of carbon dioxide:&#8593; \( P_ACO_2 \) (hypoventilation),&#8593; \( P_aCO_2 \) &#8594; activation of central chemoreceptors.So the classic emphysematous patient will have by hypoxic but will have a normal \(P_ACO_2\).We only start to see carbon dioxide retained in pre-terminal cases.With chronic bronchitis, they will retain CO2 chronically.This makes sense &#8594; if the gas exchange area is damaged, it&#8217;ll affect the less diffusible gas more than the more diffusible gas.But if the airways are blocked because of inflammation, both will be affected!NoteWith emphysema, we typically don&#8217;t have an increase in PACO2.With chronic bronchitis, we do have an increase in PACO2.Case #3Case DescriptionMrs. Teresa FurtadoMrs. Furtado is 67 and has had severe chronic bronchitis for many years. She has developed worsening of her dyspnea and more purulent sputum production. Her husband called an ambulance to bring her to the hospital. In the ambulance she is given oxygen but by the time she arrives in the emergency room she is much less responsive. In emergency, the patient is lethargic but can be aroused. Blood pressure is 150/80 mmHg and pulse rate is 140/minute. Respiratory rate is 26/minute with a prolonged expiratory phase. On auscultation of the chest, mild diffuse expiratory wheezes are heard.The following are measurements of Mrs. Furtado's blood gases:			Test		In the ER		6 months ago when 'well'            	PaO2    	275 mmHg (Normal: 80-100)    	52 mmHg            	pH    	7.18 (Normal: 7.35-7.45)    	7.37            	PaCO2    	95 mmHg (Normal: 38-42)    	52 mmHg            	HCO3-    	32 mmol/L (Normal: 24-26)    	30 mmol/L    Vitals:150/80 &#8594; hypertension.Pulse rate at 140 &#8594; tachycardia.RR at 26 &#8594; tachypnea.A COPD flare is associated with a lot anxiety, which could partially explain the above symptoms.Chronic Bronchitis:Purulent sputum, prolonged expiratory phase, and expiratory wheezing are consistent with chronic bronchitis.Worsening of dyspnea indicates a flare.What is the most likely physiologic explanation for what has happened?Values from 6 months ago were abnormal, except for blood pH &#8594; now she has acidosis.In particular, she has respiratory acidosis &#8594; &#8595; pH + PaCO2 &#8593;.The acidosis could account for her lethargy and reduced responsiveness.Since she was placed on oxygen, her PaO2 was very high.The following are two ways in which excess oxygen could cause hypoventilation in this patient:1. Profound V/Q MismatchThe patient is tachypnic but hypoventilating.So if this is the case, then the amount of carbon dioxide ventilated per breath must be decreased.We have that:$$ P_ACO_2 \propto \frac{\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{\dot{V}_A}$$Since CO2 is never diffusion limited, we must have that her \(\dot{V}_A\) is low.As a result, her \( P_ACO_2 \) is high.But since we can&#8217;t measure the \(\dot{V}_A\), we compute it from the \(\dot{V}_E\), and the dead space, using:$$ \dot{V}_A = \dot{V}_E - \dot{V}_D $$So this means that her dead space has increased, since her \(\dot{V}_E = V_T \times f\) didn&#8217;t drop, as her breathing frequency went up.Now the reason her dead space has gone up was because of a profound V/Q mismatch because of the supplemental oxygen.Recall that we normally have hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which helps match perfusion to ventilation.However, if an alveoli is hyperoxic, perfusion will be maintained, even if gas exchange can&#8217;t properly be performed due to structural damage.As a result, these hyperoxic conditions can cause a V/Q mismatch!2. Attenuated Central Response due to Chronic HypercapniaAdditionally, she has probably grown to tolerate an elevated PACO2.This relieves her lungs from having to ventilate as much &#8594; for instance, if her PACO2 was doubled, then the alveolar ventilation could be halved, meaning that she&#8217;d only have to put half as much effort into breathing.Since the central chemoreceptors have grown to tolerate the elevated PACO2, she&#8217;s essentially relying on her hypoxic chemoreceptors to drive ventilation.Now, when she was given 100% oxygen, her peripheral chemoreceptor response is stopped, so her respiratory rate drops. This causes hypoventilation, causing acidosis.What should be done at this point?Get her off the oxygen.We need to resolve the acidosis before she dies of it!We should titrate the oxygen down to the point so she can ventilate again.Alternatively, we will mechanically ventilate her.So here we conceptually have two choices:Get her to breathe &#8594; lower the oxygen to stimulate her hypoxic ventilatory drive.Breathe for her. &#8594; mechanical breathing.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/28/respiratory-physiology-case-review.html"},
	{"title": "Pneumonia &amp; Tuberculosis", "text": "What is Pneumonia?Pneumonia is inflammation of the lung parenchyma associated with alveolar filling by exudate.You must have a radiographic evidence of an infiltrate to diagnose a patient with pneumonia.Even with the symptoms, you need a radiographic correlate.Clinical Approach to Suspected PneumoniaConsider the clinical presentation.Is this pneumonia?Could there be an alternative explanation? Obviously, not anyone with a cough has pneumonia, for instance.Consider the host (patient).Are there any host risk factors to consider? They could have risk factors that predispose them to infection, such as any form of immunodeficiency.We rarely know what organism is infecting the patient when we prescribe antibiotics, so we often have to make the best guess. This depends significantly on what type of patient we have!How severe is the illness for this patient?Do the necessary diagnostic tests.Classify the pneumonia.This will be a big emphasis of this lecture.Classification of the pneumonia drives our decision on which antbiotics to use clinically.Start empiric antibiotic and supportive therapy.Empiric = our best guess.Supportive therapy includes oxygen, hydration, etc.Re-evaluate.Since we&#8217;re making our best guess as to what the causative organisms are, we&#8217;re not always sure if our treatment will work.So we have to follow the patient to see if they improve or not, and to ensure that they don&#8217;t develop complications.What if the patient isn&#8217;t getting better?Wrong diagnosis? Is it really pneumonia?Wrong bug?Wrong drug?Complication of pneumonia.Bad protoplasm (host) &#8594; even with ideal treatment, not everyone will survive.Clinical WorkupHistorical Data (In all patients)Host risk factors &#8594; immunosuppression is the big one we&#8217;re worried about.Travel history.Any important animal/environmental exposures.Physical ExamVitals (Pulse, BP, RR, Temp) + SaturationChest examination.Chest X-RayTo confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. We need evidence of pulmonary infiltrates.May uncover other pulmonary disease.May document complications.Identification of the causative pathogenSputum gram stain and culture &#8594; this is usually not the case.We never know the pathogen before we start therapy!It takes a while before the tests come back, but we usually can&#8217;t wait that long before we start treating the patient!Blood culture (if hospitalized)These are generally reserved for patients sick enough to be admitted to the hospital.If they&#8217;re not that sick, the yield of blood cultures is low enough that it&#8217;s not worthwhile.Other specialized testing.Blood for serologyMeasure acute sera for antibody titre.Measure sera about 2-weeks later, when the patient is recovering (convalescent).We look for a 4-fold rise in antibody titre for a pathogen, to help diagnose which pathogen was infecting them.This is rarely done because the patient is going to be better by the time we determine the pathogen! Not useful clinically.It is useful when doing an epidemiological analysis of which bugs are in the community &#8594; this helps in guiding which antibiotics we use for empiric therapy.Other blood workUsually only done in ill patients.Blood gases.CBC &#8594; especially their white count.Electrolytes, BUN (Blood urea nitrogen), creatinine.Special InvestigationsCT thorax &#8594; only done in the extremely sick, and if we&#8217;re worried about empyema (pus in the pleural space).Sampling TechniquesExpectorated Sputum &#8594; get the patient to cough up sputum.Unfortunately, this can be contaminated by oropharyngeal flora.You also often get spit instead of sputum.Not a very accurate test in general &#8594; look at sputum results somewhat guardedly.Bronchoscopy (Invasive &#8593;)Put a scope down into a patient&#8217;s lower airways.Somewhat invasive, so this obviously isn&#8217;t done in every patient with pneumonia.Open Lung Biopsy (Invasive &#8593;&#8593;)Extremely rare.Only done in extremely complicated cases.Blood CulturesOnly done in patients sick enough to be hospitalized, as said before.If you&#8217;re growing the bacteria in your blood, it&#8217;s always a pathogen &#8594; always a true positive.So a blood culture, if viable, is more specific than a sputum culture, which may be contaminated with normal flora.Classifications of PneumoniaThere are 4 classifications of pneumonia that we&#8217;ll be talking about.These aren&#8217;t based on the bug, but based on the setting where we see them in.Classifications of PneumoniaCommunity Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) &#8594; caught outside the hospital.Bacterial etiology.&#8216;Atypical&#8217; pneumonia syndrome.Nosocomial Pneumonia (NP) &#8594; hospital acquired pneumonia.Anaerobic Pneumonia (AP) and Lung Abcess &#8594; if you have a lung abcess.Pneumonia in an Immunocompromised Host (PIH) &#8594; patient also has an immunodeficiency.Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is often talked about as either a bacterial pneumonia, or an atypical pneumonia.In all epidemiological studies, the number one pathogen causing bacterial pneumonia is always Strep. pneumoniae &#8594; causes pneumococcal pneumonia.As we saw in Infection &#38; Immunity, the big 3 pathogens causing typical community acquired pneumonia are:Streptococcus pneumoniaeHaemophilus influenzaeStaphylococcus aureusAtypical organisms, such as mycoplasma, chlamydia, etc, generally have a slightly different presentation.However, in practice, it&#8217;s very hard to differentiate between these.Since we&#8217;re so bad at differentiating between the two, our treatment for CAP covers both bacterial and atypical pneumonias!Bacterial vs Atypical Community Acquired Pneumonia        	Bacterial Pneumonia    	Atypical Pneumonia            	Pulmonary Sx predominate.    	Prominent extrapulmonary Sx.            	Abrupt onset.    	Insidious onset.            	Purulent sputum.    	Dry cough, mucoid sputum.            	Possible consolidation on CXR.    	Diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.            	Major PathogensS. pneumoniaeH. influenzaeS. aureus    	Major PathogensMycoplasma pneumoniaeChlamydiaViral infection    Lobar PneumoniaAn infiltrate that is localized to a specific lobe is classic for a bacterial organism.For instance, the X-ray below would be classic for a pneumococcal pneumonia.Diffuse (Non-lobar) PneumoniaAs we said before, this is classic for an atypical pneumonia such as a mycoplasma pneumonia.There are multifocal infiltrates, on both sides of the chest.However, although this sounds straightforward, in practice it&#8217;s not always accurate.Consider the bottom two chest x-rays.The bottom left one looks like a lobar bacterial pneumonia.The bottom right one looks like a diffuse atypical pneumonia.However, you can&#8217;t gram stain a chest x-ray!You can&#8217;t just look at a chest x-ray and predict the bug!It just doesn&#8217;t work that well in practice, without other evidence.Treatment of Community Acquired Pneumonia1. Outpatient Tx without co-morbidity and &#60;60 y.o.Possible Organisms &#8594; in order of likelihood.Strep. pneumoniaeMycoplasma pneumoniaeRespiratory virusesChlamydia pneumoniaHaemophilus influenzaeMiscellaneous (and less likely)Staph. aureusGram negative bacteria.Empiric Therapy &#8594; MacrolideErythromycinAzythromycinClarithromycinThe reason we use a macrolide is because they cover both Strep. pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and cover them well.RememberIn a young patient with CAP with no comorbidities, you would treat them with a macrolide.2. Outpatient Tx with co-morbidity and/or &#62;60 y.o.If they&#8217;re older and/or they have a co-morbidity, they&#8217;re more likely to have gram-negative organism or more unusual organisms.So you&#8217;d want to use a more broad spectrum antibiotic.Possible Organisms &#8594; in order of likelihood.Strep. pneumoniaeMycoplasma pneumoniaeRespiratory virusesAerobic gram negativesS. aureusMiscellaneous (and less likely)LegionellaTuberculosisEmpiric Therapy &#8594; FluoroquinoloneLevofloxacinMoxifloxacinCiprofloxacin would not be recommended as much, because it has weaker activity against S. pneumoniae compared to other fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin.RememberIn an older patient and/or a patient with co-morbidities, with CAP, you would treat them with a fluoroquinolone.Hospitalization with Community Acquired PneumoniaBelow is a reasonable guide to whether a patient should be managed as an inpatient or an outpatient.Known as the CURB-65 score:C = Confusion &#8594; very worrisome. Could be because of severe hypoxia or because the patient is beginning to become septic.U = Urea &#62; 7 mmol/LR = Respiratory Rate &geq;30/minB = Blood pressure (SBP &#60; 90 mmHg, or DBP &leq; 60 mmHg)65 = Age &geq; 65You get 1 point for satisfying each criteria.0-1 = home treatment.2 = consider hospital supervised treatment.&geq;3 = manage in hospital as severe pneumonia.This is basically a suggestion, and isn&#8217;t written in stone.In practice, the decision on whether to admit or not is more flexible.Nosocomial Pneumonia (NP)Also called Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP).Etiologically, NP is usually due to the aspiration of oropharyngeal contents (gram-negatives) into the lower respiratory tracts.For reasons that are somewhat unclear, when you are admitted into the hospital, over time, the bacteria in your mouth changes from predominantly gram-positive flora into gram-negative flora.This usually happens within 24-48 hours of admission.These gram-negative organisms are now in their mouth, where they&#8217;re highly susceptible to aspiration due to the procedures we do to patients in the hospital.However, diagnosis is difficult because patients will probably have many other problems that may cause an abnormal chest x-ray.Major pathogens:Aerobic gram negative rods &#8594; 60%Anerobic bacteria &#8594; 20%Staph. aureus &#8594; 11%Strep. pneumonia &#8594; 3%Note that aerobic gram negative rods predominate, while the most common cause of CAP, Strep. pneumoniae, is generally very rare.Hence, we need an antibiotic with gram negative coverage.eg. a 3rd generation cephalosporin, or a carbapenem.Pip/taz is another example (recall that it&#8217;s one of the antibiotics you would use to treat a Pseudomonas infection, which is the &#8216;most gram negative of the gram negatives&#8217;.)Remember:With a nosocomial pneumonia (NP), aka. a Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP), you would use an antibiotic with gram negative coverage due to the preponderance of gram negative rods.Anaerobic Pneumonia &#38; Lung Abcess (AP)Often caused because of poor dental hygiene and aspiration of bacteria.Differs symptomatically from the usual bacterial pneumonia:More indolent symptoms, with an absence of rigors.Hx with something that predisposes them towards aspiration.Alcoholism that causes them to drink to unconsciousness regularly.Poorly controlled seizures that cause them to lose consciousness.Anything that prevents them from properly protecting their airway.Often they&#8217;re not really sick, and don&#8217;t have the obvious presentation of most CAPs.Even though they often cough up very putrid, purulent sputum, we often don&#8217;t recover pathogens from cultures.The reason the cultures are negative is because they&#8217;re growing anaerobic organisms.Will often have a very foul sputum (room-clearing level of smelliness).Concurrent evidence of periodontal disease likely.Although poor dental hygiene isn&#8217;t necessary, having teeth is.If you have teeth, they&#8217;ll have anaerobic organisms in their mouth.If you don&#8217;t have teeth, you won&#8217;t get a lung abcess!X-ray or CT-scan showing evidence of pulmonary necrosis (lung abcess)Hence, history is key, and radiology is effectively diagnostic.Treatment is unique &#8594; Penicillin or Clindamycin.Normally, these aren&#8217;t used, but they&#8217;re great for lung abcesses.RememberIn a patient with anaerobic pneumonia (AP), you would treat them with Penicillin G or, as a second choice, Clindamycin.Radiology of a Lung AbcessThe air fluid level is circled above in red.When you have a lung abcess, you&#8217;ll have an air-fluid level in your lung.This is because the abcess is half full of pus, and half full of air.Pneumonia in the Immunocompromised HostBecause immunocompromised patients can get infected with anything, you&#8217;ll be dealing with many different organisms, including some weird ones.Often needs invasive diagnostic testing.Empiric therapy has to be very broad.These are the patients that we typically bronchoscope, so we can definitively determine the causative agent.We can&#8217;t give them treatment for everything (including antifungals, antiprotozoals, etc.), because that would be impractical!The archetypical example of an infection in an immunocompromised host would be one with Pneumocystis pneumonia, which, as we recall from Infection &#38; Immunity, was one of our AIDS defining criteria.RememberIn an immunocompromised patient with pneumonia, we would bronchoscope the patient, to determine the causative agent.This is because empiric therapy would be unfeasibly broad!Complications of PneumoniaParapneumonic effusion &#8594; pleural disease adjacent to where the pneumonia is.The pleura gets inflammed adjacent to where the pneumonia is.This causes fluid to accumulate.Empyema &#8594; if the fluid in the pleura becomes infected, we have an empyema!Respiratory failureSometimes the pneumonia can be so widespread that the patient can go into respiratory failure.This can progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is the main cause of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.Here we see a CXR showing possible pleural effusion in the right lower lung. In the CT scan, we see two pleural effusions. This is characteristic of a loculated collection of fluid, and is almost always secondary to pneumonia.TuberculosisIf you culture TB, it&#8217;s always a pathogen &#8594; culture = diagnosis.One third of the world is infected.Primary vs. reactivation disease &#8594; recall we can have latent TB, which can progress to active TB.Skin testing/chemoprophylaxisRecall that the skin test was a delayed Type IV hypersensitivity reaction that showed if there was a response to TB antigen &#8594; it doesn&#8217;t show if the patient has active TB or not.Chemoprophylaxis (6 months of Isoniazid) should be used if the patient has a positive TB-test and is in a high-risk group (HIV, high prevalence country, etc.)", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/28/pneumonia-tuberculosis.html"},
	{"title": "Pulmonary Function Testing", "text": "Week OverviewHere is an example of a pulmonary function report.Demographics will be shown at the top.Pulmonary function baseline values are normalized to age, sex, and height.Values are generally expressed as a percentage of the baseline.A PFT gives you everything shown below, but spirometry only gives you that relevant section. (Just like with a CBC vs. a CBCD)SpirometryMeasurement of ventilatory capacity.Forced Vital Capacity Maneuver.Volume exhaled-time or flow-volume curve.The best test of pulmonary function.It&#8217;s the most reproducible, and the most predictive value of lung health.The measurements it obtains are:FVC (L) &#8594; Forced vital capacity.FEV1 (L) &#8594; Forced expiratory volume at 1 second.PEFR (L/min) &#8594; Peak expiratory flow rate.By far the most commonly done pulmonary test.Can be visualized as a flow-volume curve, or a volume-time curve.Like most physiological variables, your FEV1 increases until around 20/21, and then it steadily declines.There&#8217;s generally a gradual decline of around 7 mL a year.Pathological Spirometry ResultsObstructive vs Restrictive DiseaseWith an obstructive lung disease, the ratio of FEV1/FVC &#8595;.With a restrictive lung disease, we may have that FVC &#8595;, and FEV1 &#8595;, but FEV1/FVC is normal.Increasingly, flow-volume curves are used instead.To the right is what the flow-volume curve would look like with an obstructive lung disease versus a restrictive one.The dotted lines are the predicted normal values.The solid lines are the actual measurements.We have loops because we measure the entire inspiratory-expiratory loop.As with before, we can determine the FEV1/FVC ratio to differentiate between an obstructive or restrictive disease.The Peak Flow MeterUsed when a spirometer isn&#8217;t available, or if you want something that the patient can bring home to self assess.The peak flow meter just allows you to measure the peak expiratory flow rate.Often used as a surrogate marker of their FEV1.Patients will often self-record a record of their peak flows to look at how different environments affect their lung function.Measures highest flow sustained for 10 msec, expressed in L/minuteCorrelates well with FEV1Used commonly with asthma &#8594; looking for variations in their peak flow in response to different environments/stimuli.Lung Volume AssessmentSome lung volumes cannot be measured withwith a spirometer.Recall that we can&#8217;t measure the residual volume with a spirometer, because a spirometer can only measure flows.This means that we can&#8217;t assess volumes like the total lung capacity or any other volume that involves the RV.Also, even for volumes you can assess, such as the VC, even if you knew that it was 4L for example, you wouldn&#8217;t know if it was from 6L &#8594; 2L, or from 7L &#8594; 3L, etc.Because of this, we need a way of measuring lung capacities.Lung volumes change significantly in many lung diseases.Typically, the RV is around 20% of the TLC.This ratio increases with obstructive diseases like emphysema because of gas-trapping causing hyperinflation &#8594; RV&#8593;.With restrictive diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, neuromuscular disease, or severe, there will be a fall in the TLCSo TLC and RV values help tremendously in making a diagnosis!The Helium Dilution TechniqueMeasuring volumes is done via gas dilution.We take a known volume and concentration of gas, eg. Helium, and get the patient to breathe in to the point where it equilibrates with the lungs.Then we measure the new concentration of helium.So since we knew the original volume of helium, and the original concentration, with the new concentration, we can obtain the new volume!This is because the ratio of concentrations should be the same as the ratio of volumes:$$\frac{C_1}{C_2} = \frac{V_1}{V_2}$$Another way that you can do this is with plethysmography, which is somewhat more complicated.The patient sits in a box, and you measure their intrathoracic gas volume.Diffusing CapacityWe give patients a small amount of carbon monoxide of a known concentration and volume.This volume isn&#8217;t substantial enough to affect their physiology.We get the patient to take a deep breath in, hold it for about 10 seconds, and then have them breath out.We then measure the amount of CO that was exhaled to know how much was taken up by their lungs.Carbon monoxide is readily diffusible, so it&#8217;s a good assessment of diffusion.Recorded as \(D_{L_{CO}}\) &#8594; diffusing capacity in the lung of carbon monoxide.It&#8217;s a conductance term &#8594; it reflects how gas is conducted across the alveolar wall.What causes a low Diffusing Capacity?Possible causes of a true low diffusing capacity include:Reduced or lost alveolar surface area &#8594; eg. Emphysema.Reduced or lost capillary surface area &#8594; eg. a pulmonary embolism.An isolated low diffusing capacity is suggestive of vascular disease &#8594; nothing wrong with volumes or flows, then it&#8217;s probably something wrong with perfusion!Increased diffusion distance &#8594; eg. anything that thickens the interstitium.In other words, impairment on either side of the diffusion membrane, or increased distance between the two.Obviously, if the patient is anemic, then less gas can be bound to less hemoglobin.So you need to adjust for the patient&#8217;s hemoglobin when you&#8217;re assessing a diffusing capacity.So a fictitious low diffusing capacity can be caused by:Anemia &#8594; less hemoglobin involved in gas exchange.Carboxyhemoglobin &#8594; Hemoglobin bound to Carbon Monoxide can&#8217;t be involved in gas exchange.Causes of a Low Diffusing CapacityTrueReduced alveolar surface areaReduced capillary surface areaIncreased Diffusion DistanceFictitiousAnemiaCarboxyhemoglobinMaximal Respiratory PressuresMeasures of the strength of inspiratory and expiratory muscles.Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)global inspiratory respiratory muscle strengthmainly diaphragmMaximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP)global expiratory respiratory muscle strengthmainly abdominal musclesDone in instances where you&#8217;re worried that muscle strength is affected.Arterial Blood GasesArterial Blood Gases (ABGs) are typically taken from the radial artery.As we said before, there&#8217;s an A &#8594; a gradient for oxygen, but there isn&#8217;t one for CO2.This gradient is pretty predictable &#8594; it&#8217;s smaller when you&#8217;re younger, but increases as you age.This is due to a decline in your arterial partial pressure of oxygen.Your PAO2 generally remains constant.This results in a gradual increase in the A-a gradient as you age, as seen on the right.The absolute A-a gradient is very useful, which can be determined by getting the arterial blood gas from this test, and calculating the alveolar blood gas using the alveolar gas equation we saw before:$$ P_AO_2 = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}$$Causes of HypoxemiaThere are effectively only 3 causes of hypoxemia.HypoventilationVentilation to perfusion mismatchIntracardiac or intrapulmonary shuntWe can easily differentiate between the 3 based on blood gases.This will be covered more thoroughly in the Blood Gases lecture.Oxygen saturation can be assessed with a pulse oximeter.Causes of HypercapniaBlunted Ventilatory DriveAbnormal Respiratory MechanicsSevere airway obstruction.Weak respiratory muscles.Severely deranged lung parenchyma causing a V/Q mismatchComponents of the ventilatory pump. Any of these can be abnormal, causing either a decreased ventilatory drive, or abnormal respiration.ExamplesPulmonary Function Test 160 y/o male, 75 kg.His FEV1 is 26% of normal!His FEV1/FVC is only 28% &#8594; severe obstructive lung disease.Looking at his lung volumes, his TLC is normal, but his RV is high, suggestive of gas-trapping.His diffusing capacity is 34% of normal.So this patient obviously has emphysema.Pulmonary Function Test 2Vital capacity and FEV1 are both around 2/3 of normal.His FEV1/FVC is 76%, which is just as predicted given his age, gender, and height.His lung volumes are globally decreased.This is suggestive of a restrictive lung disease.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/28/pulmonary-function-testing.html"},
	{"title": "Smoking Cessation Interventions", "text": "Lecture OutlineSmoking StatisticsHealth Effects of SmokingNicotine AdditionBenefits of Smoking CessationStrategies for Smoking CessationDrug therapy for Nicotine DependenceIntroductionIs as addictive, if not more addictive than heroin.These patients have zero control over their lives, they&#8217;ve just been given a death sentence.This makes it difficult for them to quit &#8594; they&#8217;re high stress, and serotonin is released when you smoke, which keeps people calm.Also, the recent growth of reserve cigarettes, which are made at first nations reserves, has changed things.Since First Nations groups are exempt from taxes when selling cigarettes on the reserve, they can be produced more cheaply. These are then snuck out of the reserve for a broader availability.They&#8217;re as full of chemicals as cigarettes from the major brands, and contain low grade tobacco.Since they&#8217;re cheaper than a premium brand, this has widened availability.Smoking Statistics17% of adults are current smokers (20% men, 14% women)13% of Canadians &geq; 15 reported smoking daily.In Ontario this is 15% (14% in BC, 21% in SK, MB &#38; NS)We generally see that smoking in men is more habitual, while in women it&#8217;s more related to stress.We have seen a decline in smoking rates, but this isn&#8217;t low enough.What other measures provincially have been tried to prevent smoking?Preventing smoking in restaurants in bar.Smoke Free Ontario &#8594; McGuinty government removed the PST from nicotine replacement patches.Health Effects of SmokingEyes: cataracts, macular degenerationSkin: skin cancer, wrinklesOral Cavity: periodontal disease, tooth loss, cancerBlood: polycythemia, leukemiaEndocrine: diabetesBones: osteoporosis, fracturesSleep: sleep disturbance, insomniaNeurology: cognitive decline, stroke, metastasesOB/GYN: infertility, miscarriage, prematurity, LBW, perinatal mortality, SIDSSquamous Cell Carcinoma is the archetypical skin cancer in a patient that presents with significant Hx of smoking and alcohol.Nicotine AddictionExtremely addictive.Rapidly absorbed into the blodd &#8594; the lung is a vascular bed and nicotine is delivered to the brain in 7 seconds via the arterial system.Nicotine stimulates CNS receptors and causes the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, vasopressin, and beta-endorphin.Their release causes euphoria, improves anxiety, improves depression, improves concentration, and makes people feel good.With these benefits, why wouldn&#8217;t patients under high stress want to smoke?This can also lead to nicotine dependence.Nicotine DependenceDopamine may be the &#8216;master&#8217; molecule of addiction (reward pathway)Smoking causes a decrease in MAO - an enzyme that breaks down dopamine.Smoker&#8217;s brain gets accustomed to a certain level of nicotine and tolerance develops.This means that the brain becomes dependent on nicotine to produce even normal levels of dopamine.Higher levels of nicotine become necessary to produce the same effects &#8594; smokers smoke more!Nicotine manufacturers are actually smart and take advantage of this by front-loading their cigarettes.This means that smokers get the biggest hit from the first drag of the cigarette.They then want to have another cigarette to get that front-loaded hit again!Nicotine DosingSmokers dose themselves with nicotine to maintain a &#8216;comfortable&#8217; level.Symptoms on withdrawal &#8594; the opposite effects from what was described previously &#8594; melancholy, anxiety, depression, stress, decreased concentration, etc.Increase in BP, tremors, possible insomnia, nausea.Increase in cough.Physical/psychological dependencePersistence even in the face of harmCould have the most determined patient, but without support, they&#8217;ll probably still fail!Smokers want to Quit64% of smokers had tried to quit in 2001 and 28% tried more than once.24% smokers intended to quit in the next 6 months3% of smokers will successfully quit without formal assistance70% of smokers visit a physician each yearSmokers cite a doctor&#8217;s advice to quit as an important motivator for attempting to quit.Benefits of SmokingFor some people smoking relieves stress, perks them up in the morning, acts as a friend when lonely, is a break from the world, instills confidence, and acts as an activity to relieve boredom.They&#8217;re also a form of coping.Cigarettes are an emotional crutchMost smokers have never had an adult moment without a cigaretteMany smokers are afraid of life without smoking.Benefits of Smoking CessationReduces the risk of new disease &#8594; both recurrence and new disease.A study from the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto showed a 50% reduction in the recurrence of ENT cancer in patients who quit smoking.Slows the progression of existing tobacco related disease.Lung cancer risk drops 40% by 2 to 5 years and approaches that of non-smokers by 10 - 15 yearsIncreases life expectancy even when quitting after the age of 65 or after the development of tobacco related diseaseIt&#8217;s never too late to quit!Health Changes post Cessation20 minutes &#8594;

AskImplement a system that ensures that tobacco use status is obtained and recorded for every patient at every visitTailor the intervention according to the level of readiness2. AssessDetermine the patient&#8217;s readiness to change - e.g., precontemplator vs. contemplatorDetermine the patient&#8217;s level of addiction to nicotine to help customize therapy (Fagerstr&#246;m index)The Fagerstr&#246;m Nicotine Dependency Scale is used to assess nicotine addition &#8594; 10 is the maximum, and 5 is someone who is moderately addicted.It&#8217;s a series of question looking at smoking patterns.We often assess a patient&#8217;s stages of change to determine what degree of intervention we should use.When a patient is at the preperation stage, then try to implement nicotine replacement therapy or behavioural therapy.The Fagerstr&#246;m Index:How soon after waking do you smoke first cigarette?Time less than 5 minutes: 3 pointsTime 5 to 30 minutes: 2 pointsTime 31 to 60 minutes: 1 pointHow many Cigarettes do you smoke per day?Cigarettes more than 30 per day: 3 pointsCigarettes 21 to 30 per day: 2 pointsCigarettes 11 to 20 per day: 1 pointWe also assess a patient&#8217;s EtOH use because it lowers their inhibitions towards smoking.3. AdviseDon&#8217;t lecture, don&#8217;t be condescending.You must develop a therapeutic relationship with them, and you can&#8217;t do that my patronizing them!In a clear, strong, and personalized manner, urge every smoker to quitMessage should be stage appropriate.Be clear. (I think it is important for you to quit smoking now and I will help you)People respond to real rather than theoretical problems.Avoid guilting the patient.4. AssistSet a quit date, ideally within 2 weeksInform friends, family and coworkers of plans to quit and ask for supportRemove cigarettes from home, car and workplace and avoid smoking there.Try to remove their triggers.For instance, a lot of men generally smoke once they enter their car as a trigger. In this case, you would suggest putting their nicoderm inhaler in their car ashtray.Anticipate challenges, particularly during the critical first weeks, including symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.Review previous quit attempts - what helped, what led to relapse.Encourage the harm reduction model &#8594; total abstinence may be difficult to attain right at the onset, so aim to encourage small steps!5. ArrangeSchedule follow-up either in person or by phone within 2 weeks of the quit date, preferably in the first weekCongratulate success &#8594; focus on the positive!With a lapse, encourage the patient to try again.Drug Therapy for Nicotine DependenceBoth the nicotine patch and gum are effective therapies for smoking cessation.Some examples include nicorette and nicroderm.Not covered by insurance, although as covered before, the PST has been taken off.The nicotine patch may be easier to use.The gum must be used properly in order to be effective.NRTs use a slower delivery system, taking longer to show an elevation in plasma nicotine levels.NRT reduces withdrawal - irritability, depression, cravingsProvides nicotine but not tar, CO or carcinogens &#8594; less health effects compared to smoking.Not recommended in patients with unstable angina or arrhythmias, recent MI. - Nicotine is a potent vasoconstrictor!NRT use in pregnancy is controversial.Useful if the woman can&#8217;t quit and smokes 10-15 cigarettes a day.Can also use buproprion or varenicline therapy.BuproprionBuproprion hydrochloride &#8594; non-nicotine aid to smoking cessation.Sold as Zyban for the purpose of smoking cessation.It&#8217;s also used as an antidepressant, where it is sold as Wellbutrin.It is chemically unrelated to other antidepressant agents, and acts as a weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and domapine.Unknown mechanism of action in smoking cessation!An RCT showed a statistically significant improvement in smoking cessation with the use of Buproprion (Zyban).TreatmentStart 1 week before quit date at 150 mg od.Increase to 150 mg po bid (as tolerated).Maximum dose 300 mg per dayDiscontinue drug if a rash, hives or swelling develops.7 to 12 weeks, up to 52 wks for relapse preventionUseful for patients with high levels of addiction or previous unsuccessful attemptsContraindicationsAbsolutely contraindicated in patients with seizures.Relatively contraindicated in patients taking other antidepressants or antipsychotics, or during pregnancy/breast feeding, or severe liver disease.VareniclineVarenicline is a partial agonist selective for a subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors &#8594; &#945;4&#946;2 receptor subtypes.Varenicline is also known as Champix in Canada, and Chantix in the US.These are the receptors that develop over time as patients continue to smoke.Varenicline activates the &#945;4&#946;2 receptors, but at a reduced level than with nicotine.By binding to the receptors however, it blocks the binding of nicotine, which blocks the reinforcement and reward pathway that nicotine itself activates.A Cochrane review found that Varenicline was the most effective treatment, followed by combined NRT treatment (eg. a patch coupled by gum), and then Buproprion (Zyban), and then a single modality NRT.So Varenicline is our most effective drug for smoking cessation, however it is more expensive, and has a higher risk of side effects.Effectiveness of Pharmacological Cessation InterventionsVareniclineCombined NRT &#8594; eg. a patch combined with gum.Buproprion (Zyban)Single Modality NRTSide EffectsVarenicline does have significant side effects, the most common of which is extreme nausea.Varenicline is not used in combination with NRT!There is also the possibility of behavioural changes &#8594; there&#8217;s a black box warning on the drug package itself warning of possible suicidal ideations and homocidal ideations.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/27/smoking-cessation-interventions.html"},
	{"title": "Obstructive Lung Diseases II", "text": "AsthmaAsthma, like COPD is also a chronic disease &#8594; it&#8217;s non-curable.But the difference between asthma and COPD is that asthma is completely controllable.So with asthma, we have different treatment goals than with COPD. - With asthma, we aim to have completely normal lung function with optimal therapy.DefinitionAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells play a role, including mast cells and eosinophils.In susceptible individuals, this inflammation may cause reversible airway obstruction.In this way, asthma is more similar to chronic bronchitis &#8594; inflammation rather than wall destruction.Asthma affects 3-20% of the population &#8594; extremely common.RememberBoth asthma and COPD are chronic obstructive lung diseases that are non-curable.With asthma, loss of lung function can be completely reversibleWith COPD, there is some permanent loss of functionSo to diagnose asthma, we must show obstruction and normalizability.Differentiating Asthma from Other DiagnosesAsthma can be differentiated from other diagnoses in that it causes an increase in airway responsiveness.Many diseases will present with cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness.But few patients will say yes to all of the following:Is it worse around cold air?Is it worse around dust?Is it worse around smoke?Is it worse around perfumes/strong odours?If they say yes to all of the above, they likely have a hyperreactive airway, which would suggest that it&#8217;s asthma!Pathogenesis of AsthmaThe etiology of asthma is unknown.There may be genetic factors that predispose a patient towards asthma.Recall the atopic triad &#8594; atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma.There are also many hypotheses that we&#8217;ve seen before, eg. the hygiene hypothesis, or increasing levels of environmental pollutants.Athletic Exposure to cold air may play a key role:Comparing individuals that participate in cold winter sports, and similar individuals the participate in indoor sports, there is a significant difference in asthma prevalence.50% of those who trained in cold air had asthma, versus 4-6% who trained indoors.The two groups were matched for baseline criteria, but even still, there was a substantial difference!Airway InflammationAs we saw in Infection &#38; Immunity, the inflammatory response is complex. Some of the agents involved were:Mast cells, eosinophils, lymphocytes and macrophages.Histamine, eosinophil peptides, lipid mediators (leukotrienes, prostaglandins, throboxanes), and cytokines (interleukins, TNF).Some therapies are now directed as specific mediators.Chronic smooth muscle inflammation can convert chronically poorly controlled asthma into COPD via remodeling.This is because this chronic inflammation can cause thickening of the smooth muscle, reducing its degree of response.Clinical Features &#38; Diagnosis of AsthmaAs mentioned before, these are very non-specific, and not completely penetrant.Dyspnea, dry cough or yellow sputum, and wheezing are the general symptoms.As mentioned before, the irritant/hyperresponsive airway response is usually the easiest way to diagnose asthma.RememberAsthma can be differentiated from other diagnoses in that it causes an increase in airway responsiveness.This can be checked by seeing if the patient says yes to the following:Is it worse around cold air?Is it worse around dust?Is it worse around smoke?Is it worse around perfumes/strong odours?If you suspect asthma, you can often use a diagnostic therapeutic intervention:That is, since the medication used to treat asthma (bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids), aren&#8217;t particularly dangerous, we can actually give the patient the medication and see if they improve.This lets us avoid having to do more tedious tests to confirm the diagnosis.If we have a more atypical patient, with other comorbities that could be causing the symptoms, we can use spirometry.Recall that the pathognomonic finding for airway obstruction is a decrease in FEV1/FVC.If we do see &#8595; FEV1/FVC, then we&#8217;ll give the patient appropriate therapy, and see if this ratio normalizes.If it does, then lung function is normalizable, so this is asthma!So obstruction and normalizability is diagnostic of asthma.Bronchoprovocation TestingWhat if you have a patient that is symptomatic, but has normal pulmonary function tests, and doesn&#8217;t improve with the puffers?Then what we would use is a bronchoprovocation test (with methacholine/histamine).This is used to try to provoke bronchospasm, and duplicate the pathophysiology of asthma.Then we can work in reverse &#8594; we show a decrease in lung function with the introduction of an irritant.This is done sometimes with athletes that are more difficult to diagnose, as they may only have symptoms after extremely intense physical activity.General ApproachIn general, we do spirometry to determine if there&#8217;s obstruction, and then give a therapeutic to see if it normalizes.GP&#8217;s generally use a diagnostic therapeutic approach (give the medication and see if it gets better).Respirologists generally prefer pulmonary function testing.Determining NormalizabilityTo determine if the airflow obstruction is reversible, we use the following criteria:Management of AsthmaWhen we&#8217;re managing asthma, we have the following goals:Educate patientsEnsure they keep taking the medications after symptoms subside, instead of stopping right when the symptoms disappear.When given multiple puffers, don&#8217;t just use the one that alleviates the symptoms (eg. the bronchodilators), but also use the anti-inflammatory, which will affect the cause of the asthma itself.Make sure they know what their medications do, and how to use them.Assess asthma severity and controlDetermine if they&#8217;re optimally controlled.Know what to do if they&#8217;re not controlled.Avoid or control asthma triggersMedication plan: chronic managementManagement plan: acute exacerbationsRegular follow-up careSeverity vs ControlSevere asthma can be well controlled.Mild asthma can be poorly controlled.Mild, moderate, and severe asthma can all have life threatening exacerbations.Asthma SeverityFactors that affect asthma severity include:Symptom frequency and duration.Airflow limitation (FEV1)Medication required to maintain controlPrior near-fatal episodeRecent ED visit or hospitalizationAsthma ControlA patient must satisfy all of the following to have controlled asthma: You also have to make sure they&#8217;re using their medication appropriately when you&#8217;re assessing this.Many patients use their prn Ventolin whenever they feel short of breath, but often this is because they&#8217;re out of shape.You&#8217;ll know if this is the case when they use their puffer but it doesn&#8217;t work.If they&#8217;re using the puffer 20 times a day, and they&#8217;re not in the emergency department, chances are that they&#8217;re not using it properly!Treatments for AsthmaSimilarly to COPD, this is a progression.With COPD, we saw that we used Spiriva (an anti-cholinergic bronchodilator), plus a combination product (long-acting bronchodilator and corticosteroid), and ventolin.With asthma, this is somewhat similar:1. Short Acting BronchodilatorsShort-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) include Salbutamol (Ventolin), or Albuterol (Bricanyl) &#8594; both are the same drug, just a different name.Salbutamol is a &#946;2-adrenergic agonist, causing bronchodilation.It provides fast relief within 10-15 minutes.These are not anti-inflammatory drugs &#8594; those would be the inhaled steroids!Should be used on a p.r.n. basis, even with COPD.The frequency of use reflects control.All asthmatics should have this puffer for immediate relief of symptoms.This would be considered a reliever.2. Inhaled CorticosteroidsThese are generally used after SABAs.Initial anti-inflammatory therapy.Dosage can be increased in patients with poor control.This would be considered a contoller.Some examples of inhaled corticosteroids (CS) include Flovent, and Pulmicort.RememberMedications such as Short-acting bronchodilators (ie. Ventolin) are relieversThey relieve symptoms but do not affect the disease state itself.Medications such as inhaled corticosteroids are controllersThey affect disease progression but may not immediately relieve symptoms.3. Long Acting BronchodilatorsThese are the long-acting beta-agonists (LABA).Examples include Salmeterol (Serevent) or Formoterol (Oxeze).These are controllers, but may also have an acute relieving effect.Never use without anti-inflammatories &#8594; Usually added on to inhaled steroids.Now, we have combination products which are a combined LABA + CS.4. LABA-CS Combination ProductsLABA-CS = Long acting Beta-Agonist + Inhaled Corticosteroid.More convenient, and gives better control of asthma.Less cost, possibly due to better control.&#8220;The new Gold Standard for Asthma Control&#8221;Now, instead of going from a SABA &#8594; LABA + CS, we go from a SABA &#8594; Combo-product.5. Leukotriene InhibitorsThese are also controllers.Leukotriene Inhibitors are used as an alternative to inhaled steroids.They&#8217;re anti-inflammatory, but they&#8217;re not steroids.Used when patients can&#8217;t use puffers properly or don&#8217;t like using puffers.Taken orally in a pill form.Examples include Monteleukast (Singulair), and Zafirlukast (Accolate).When leukotriene inhibitors came out, people thought they would be revoluationary. However, they&#8217;re less effective than corticosteroids.They only target the leukotriene pathway in inflammation, so they&#8217;re less useful.Only a subset of patients will respond to this treatment (15%), and you cannot predict the responders &#8594; it&#8217;ll work for some, but not for others.In patients where their response is driven by the leukotriene pathway however, this is a great medication.Summary of Asthma TreatmentStart with a Short acting beta-agonist (SABA).If they only this sparsely, they may not need an inhaled steroid.These are used as relievers.Add a LABA + CS or LABA-CS.Long acting beta-agonists should be taken with a corticosteroid, either separately, or as a combination product.Both are controllers.Leukotriene Inhibitors are an alternative to corticosteroids.Leukotriene inhibitors can be used if the patient can&#8217;t use puffers properly or don&#8217;t like using them.They&#8217;re less effective than corticosteroids, because they only target the leukotriene pathway.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/27/obstructive-diseases-2.html"},
	{"title": "Obstructive Lung Diseases I", "text": "A look at chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which refers to emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or both conditions. Chronic bronchitis is where inflammation of the lining of the airways causes constriction, while emphysema is due to destruction of the alveolar walls causing a reduction in surface area.IntroductionA lung disease can either affect the airways, or the parenchyma (alveoli + interstitium).Lung diseases that affect the airways are more obstructive lung diseases, and diseases that affect the parenchyma are more restrictive lung diseases.Obstructive Lung Disease &#8594; airway narrowing.Restrictive Lung Disease &#8594; restriction of lung expansion.Obstructive lung diseases include:Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)EmphysemaChronic BronchitisAsthmaMiscellaneousUpper airway obstruction.BronchioltisChronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseCOPD = Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.Can also be called Chronic Airflow Obstruction, Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COLD), etc.But really, COPD is usually refers to emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or both.These two diseases can both cause air trapping.Since you can&#8217;t get all the air out before your next breath, there is some trapped air. When you breathe in afterwards, there is then hyperinflation of the lungs.Chronic BronchitisFor the most part, this is a sputum-producing disorder.In bronchitis, there&#8217;s inflammation of the airways, and mucous production.Here, we have inflammation, but not infection.This causes narrowing of the airway tube, increasing resistance, and causing obstruction.In pure chronic bronchitis, the alveoli are not structurally impaired.So mechanistically, the airways are narrowed, but the alveoli themselves are fine.When you breathe in, there&#8217;s negative intrathoracic pressure, which helps open the airways. So it&#8217;s rare to have wheezing on inhalation with chronic bronchitis (until it&#8217;s very severe).However, on exhalation, forced expiration causes airway constriction, which further narrows the airway, and will cause wheezing.We also see a productive, yellowish sputum due to the inflammatory response, and this may not necessarily be due to infection!Almost always caused by smoking.EmphysemaIn Emphysema, the airways aren&#8217;t as narrowed, so patients with pure emphysema may not cough up a lot of phlegm.Here, they have shortness of breath due to a loss of lung architecture.For instance, there is permanent alveolar wall destruction due to an imbalance between trypsin and antitrypsin.This effectively reduces the surface area of the lung.Furthermore, the breakdown of elastin causes an increase in lung compliance, which affects normal expiration.Without normal elastic recoil, the alveoli are less effective at pushing out air, resulting in air trapping.This old air blocks the inflow of new air, causing obstruction.How does wall destruction reduce surface area?The idea is that in normal alveoli, we have lots of &#8216;small grapes&#8217;.When the alveolar walls are destroyed in emphysema, we end up converting this bunch of small grapes into one large &#8216;grapefruit&#8217;.This reduces the surface area to volume ratio.We assess a reduction in this surface area via something called the diffusing capacity.Hence, you would expect patients with emphysema to have a low diffusing capacity, but not those with chronic bronchitis or asthma!To the right we have a histological image of some alveoli that have been destroyed with Emphysema. Note the reduction of surface area due to wall destruction.RememberYou would expect a decrease in diffusing capacity in patients with emphysema, but not with chronic bronchitis or asthma.Who Gets COPD?Smoking is the most common and prevalent condition that leads to these diseases.So in general, when you see a patient with COPD, think smoking!You can have a patient with these conditions that doesn&#8217;t smoke, it makes it more likely that the etiology is more bizarre.For instance, there is a congenital abnormality called &#945;-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which results in an imbalance in trypsin and antitrypsin, causing alveolar wall destruction and emphysema, even at a younger age.In a patient that is younger (less than 50), or has never smoked, an &#945;-1 antitrypsin deficiency would be much higher on the differential!COPD is a condition that is &#8216;non-normalizable&#8217; &#8594; a patient can have an improvement in lung function (for instance if they quit smoking), but they will never return to normal!In other words, there&#8217;s some degree of irreversibility with COPD.On the other hand, with asthma, with optimal treatment, normal lung function can be restored!However, not that in some cases, where asthma is poorly treated, over time we can have non-normalizable lung function.This is because airway remodelling can occur, leading to chronic obstructive lung disease &#8594; COPD!In other words, persistent asthma can eventually lead to COPD, which suggests some degree of permanent damage.Chronic Bronchitis vs EmphysemaCOPD &#8594; chronic, irreversble airflow limitation. Usually progressive.Chronic Bronchitis &#8594; cough and sputum for &#62; 3 months/year for &#62; 2 years. (ie. this needs to be chronic, not acute).Emphysema &#8594; abnormal, permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, resulting in a reduction in surface area.Recall that we said that most patients with COPD have a combination of emphysema and chronic bronchitis.Chronic bronchitis is easier to diagnose &#8594; just ask the patient.Emphysema is more difficult to diagnose since it&#8217;s a pathological diagnosis.However, we can suspect emphysema if the patient has (1) a decreased diffusing capacity with pulmonary function tests, and/or (2), an abnormal CT scan.CT scans are ubiquitous now, so we can make a radiographic diagnosis even in the case of a normal pulmonary function test!Diagnosis of Chronic Bronchitis vs EmphysemaChronic Bronchitis = Cough &#38; sputum for &#62; 3 months/year for &#62; 2 years.Emphysema = decreased diffusing capacity with signs of alveolar damage on a CT scan.Epidemiology of COPDCOPD actually occurs at a younger age than you think! It&#8217;s just that most patients present at a fairly late stage.Since lungs have a great deal of reserve capacity, patients will only run into problems when they&#8217;ve already lost around half of their lung function.Generally middle-aged (40s) to the elderly.Males &gt; Females, but this gap is shrinking.Screening for COPDThere are significant improvements in morbidity and mortality when you can catch signs of COPD at a subclinical stage.As a result, the recommendation is to screen patients who smoke and are over 40 for COPD!This screening test involves spirometry to measure FEV1.If their FEV1 is less than 70% of normal, you would suggest smoking cessation, or pharmacological treatment.Physiological Consequences of COPDCOPD is characterized by airway obstruction, as given by the name.In addition, there is lung hyperinflation due to air trapping.This causes flattening of the diaphragm, and inefficient inspiration.It turns out that this hyperinflation is the biggest reason why patients are dyspneic, and not actually the airway obstruction.As this progresses, the patient&#8217;s \( P_aO_2 \) falls, and eventually, their \( P_aCO_2 \) rises &#8594; signs of respiratory failure.Physiological Features of COPDSpirometrySpirometry measures flows, not volumes.So assessments of volumes such as TLC, RV, etc, are things that would require a pulmonary function lab, where you could do helium dilution. This would be necessary when you want to determine if there is gas-trapping.However, when you&#8217;re diagnosing obstruction, you just need to perform spirometry.This is done by comparing the FEV1 to the FVCFEV1 = Forced Expiratory Volume at 1 second.FVC = Forced Vital Capacity.This is the total volume expelled after a forced expiratory maneuver.In other words, you take a deep breath, and blow out as hard as you can, for as long as you can. The volume you expel out is your forced vital capacity.Normally, you should be able to get 80% of your FVC out after 1 second.In other words, normally, FEV1/FVC = 0.8.If this ratio is lower than this (FEV1/FVC &#8595;), then by definition, we have airway obstruction.But what about with a restrictive lung disease?If a patient had restrictive lung disease (eg. because of interstitial fibrosis or obesity), both their FEV1 and their FVC would decrease.This is because the expansion of the lung itself is affected, rather than lung emptying.In other words, not only would the FEV1 fall, as with an obstructive lung disease, but the FVC would fall as well!This means that the ratio between the two will stay the same.Hence, we would see a drop in the FEV1 in both an obstructive lung disease and a restrictive lung disease, but you would only see the drop in the FEV1/FVC with an obstructive lung disease.RememberA decrease in the FEV1/FVC is pathognomonic for an obstructive lung disease.Lung VolumesHyperinflation would be seen with &#8593; TLC or &#8593; FRCRecall that FRC = functional residual capacity = ERV + RV.Gas Trapping is seen by an increase in the ratio of residual gas over the total lung volume, in other words, by &#8593; RV/TLC.To measure volumes, you need to do a helium dilution test, which usually requires a pulmonary function lab.Gas ExchangeIn mild to moderate COPD you have hypoxemia.In severe COPD this progresses to hypercapnia.As we said before, with emphysema, we have a reduction in the diffusing capacity (&#8595; \( D_{L_CO} \)).Physiological Features of COPDSpirometry&#8595;FEV1, &#8595;FEV1/FVC suggestive of obstructive lung disease.Lung Volumes&#8593;TLC, FRC suggestive of hyperinflation.&#8593;RV/TLC suggestive of gas trappingGas ExchangeHypoxemia in mild/moderate COPDHypercapnia in severe COPD&#8595;\( D_{L_CO} \) with empysema.Natural HistoryCOPD is characterized by an accelerated decline in FEV1.This decline is further accelerated in patients who smoke.There are also exacerbations (flare-ups), which will increase in frequency with worsening COPD.These flare-ups have a significant associated mortality, so if a patient is experiencing them, there will be more aggressive treatment.Features on Physical ExamThe classical patient with COPD presents with a rounded, bulging barrel chest due to hyperinflation of the lungs.They may also be cachetic.Cachexia is weight loss, muscle atrophy, and weakness, in a patient that is not actively trying to lose weight.This is because a patient has to forcibly expire with every breath when they have an obstructive lung disease, just to get the air out.Because this forced expiration also causes the airways to narrow, this can be a vicious cycle.If the patient is losing weight, it&#8217;s a bad prognostic sign.Dyspnea will only usually present with a minimum smoking exposure of 20 pack-years.So if a patient has dyspnea, but has smoked less than that, you should begin to suspect other etiologies for the shortness of breath.Early Signs &#8594; prolonged expirationModerate - Severe COPD:Cyanosis, cachexia, RR&#8593;.There will be increased expiratory effort, reflected in the use of abdominal muscles during expiration.Hyperinflation of the lungs will cause thoracic excursion, and the lung cavity will sound hyperresonant.There will be a decrease in breath sounds, and potential crackles and wheezing.Pursed Lip Breathing may also be seen, and should be suggested to a patient that is not already doing so.Pursed lip breathing optimizes alveolar emptying by creating some resistance to flow leaving the airways.This increases the intraluminal pressure to help offset the extraluminal pressure that is caused by forced expiration.This helps maintain the patency of the airways.Patients often figure this out themselves as a method of alleviating their shortness of breath.Features of Chronic BronchitisPatients with chronic bronchitis will often present with a smoker&#8217;s cough, and they may have phlegm which may not be secondary to an infection.The cough and mucoid sputum will initially be present in the morning only, but in more severe cases, can be continuous.As mentioned before, chronic bronchitis is diagnosed if there is &#62;3 months of cough/sputum per year, for over 2 years.Features of EmphysemaSince emphysema is a pathological diagnosis, we can&#8217;t see features that would definitively allow us to diagnose it.As we mentioned before, a decrease in the diffusing capacity, or signs of wall destruction in a CT, are usually required to determine if it&#8217;s emphysema.Nowadays, there are tests that patients can self-administer to determine if they should be checked for COPD.An example is below. If they answer more than 3 of these, then they should be checked for COPD.Radiological Findings with COPDIn moderate to severe COPD you will see signs of hyperinflation.Hyperinflation &#8594; an increase in the volume of the lung due to gas trapping.Radiologically, this can be seen with a flattened diaphragm, and a large intrathoracic space.You&#8217;ll be able to count more ribs anteriorly and posteriorly (this will be seen in the imaging lectures later).In addition, there will be a large retrosternal airspace, because of air that has collected in front of the heart.Normally, the heart should be right up against the sternum, but here there may be air in between.This can be seen more clearly in the lateral CXR seen below.A chest x-ray showing lung hyperinflation suggestive of an obstructive lung disease. Note that the number of ribs that can be seen has increased, and that the diagphragm has flattened.With Emphysema, you may see the formation of bulli.Here is a patient with Bullous Lung Disease secondary to emphysema.You can see white patches in the normally dark lungs!These bulli are cysts that start to take up room and don&#8217;t exchange gas. This increases the dead space in the lung.In addition, these bulli may actually press against normal lung tissue to prevent normal gas exchange in the viable tissue!As a result, there is actually surgery called lung volume reduction where we can remove these bullous regions, which are not participating in gas exchange.This aims to improve function of the rest of the symptoms, by reducing the intrathoracic volume, improving symptoms.Lung volume reduction was popular 5 years ago, but has now been shown to be similarly effective to good rehab, breating techniques, and optimal medication.As a consequence, it&#8217;s rarely done nowadays.Complications of COPDGas Exchange AbnormalitiesAs we&#8217;ve mentioned before, a patient with COPD will eventually have signs of respiratory failure &#8594; hypoxemia, followed by hypercapnia and chronic respiratory acidosis.Recurrent respiratory infectionsBarotraumaWith pressure changes in the lung, due to flying or exertion (eg. during constipation), a patient with COPD is at increased risk of suffering a pneumothoraxSleep-Disordered Breating &#8594; Cheyne-Stokes BreathingCachexia &#8594; due to increased metabolic breathing requirements.Cor pulmonale &#8594; pulmonary hypertension leading to right heart failure.Recall that chronic hypoxemia can lead to excessive hypoxic vasoconstriction, which can cause pulmonary hypertension.The increase in afterload to the right ventricle can cause right sided heart failure, since the RV is less capable to adapting to increases in pressure.This will present with classical signs of right sided heart failure &#8594; an elevated JVP, loud S2 due to a loud P2, an LV heave, and peripheral edema.So one of the major things that can change outcomes in COPD is oxygen therapy if a patient is hypoxemic.This can prevent pulmonary hypertension from occurring!Suspect low oxygen if there&#8217;s a low FEV1, and do a blood gas.Red Flag FactorsSome red flag factors that suggest severe COPD include:FEV1 &#60;50%Need for supplemental oxygen.HypercapniaRecent exacerbation/intubation.CachexiaAge, corbormidiesBasically, any signs of respiratory failure, markedly reduced FEV1, or instablity.Treating COPDTreatments aim to slow the decline in FEV1, reduce mortality, and improve the quality of life.Non-Pharmacologic TherapiesThe big one here is smoking cessation (see the lecture on Smoking Cessation).Smoking cessation markedly slows deterioration of the FEV1 in patients with COPD.Here, we see that cessation doesn&#8217;t return things to normal, but slows down the rate of progression.Hence, there&#8217;s always an advantage to quit smoking.Pharmacological TreatmentsBronchodilators.Inhaled corticosteroids.Theophylline (rarely).Long term oxygen therapy.Typical Treatment of COPDSpiriva (teotropium)Combination product (Advair/Symbicort)These are a combination of a long-acting bronchodilator and an inhaled steroid.VentolinPatients are typically on this triple therapyShould all be on Spiriva, and most will be on one of the two combo products (Advair, Symbicort) and Ventolin.These drugs differ in how they act, and how long they act:1. SpirivaSpiriva (teotropium) is an anti-cholinergic (anti-muscarinic) bronchodilator medication.It replaces Atrovent (iptratroprium bromide), which we saw in Heart &#38; Circulation, was a muscarinic receptor antagonist.Instead of having to take atrovent qid, you only need to take spiriva OD.Only need to take it OD.Recall that sympathetic innervation causes bronchodilation, so a beta-agonist or an anti-cholinergic would cause bronchodilation.2. Combination ProductThese are a combination of a long-acting bronchodilator and an inhaled steroid.The added steroid gives some anti-inflammatory function.Both Advair and Symbicort are BID3. VentolinShort-acting &#946;2-adrenergic receptor agonist.Acts as a muscle relaxant, and isn&#8217;t anti-inflammatory.Not a steroid.Used QID prn.Oxygen Therapy with COPDYou should prescribe external oxygen if the patient has a PaO2 &leq; 55 mmHg. (SaO2 &leq; 88%).If the patient has signs of right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension (cor pulmonale), then this threshold is &#60; 60 mmHg.Many patients say they don&#8217;t need oxygen, but you&#8217;ll only know this for sure if you do the blood gas.There&#8217;s a mortality benefit to this, so if the patient&#8217;s arterial oxygen saturation is less than 55 and you don&#8217;t prescribe the oxygen, you&#8217;ll shorten their life!RememberUse oxygen therapy if the PaO2 &leq;55mmHg (SaO2 &leq;88%)There&#8217;s a mortality benefit to doing so!When a patient raises their hands above their heart, their oxygen saturation can drop markedly &#8594; eg. when they&#8217;re washing their hair.So even when they&#8217;re wearing an oxygen mask, they have to be careful when taking it off.Often times, patients will take off the mask, take a shower, put stuff in their hair, and then suddenly faint.Summary of COPD TreatmentWe can view COPD treatment as a stepwise progression depending on its severity.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/27/obstructive-diseases-1.html"},
	{"title": "Respiratory Pathology &amp; Basic Histology", "text": "Case 1Case #1Mrs. A.L is a 65 year old housewife who seeks medical advice from her family physician for management of cough. She complains of persistent cough with small amounts of sputum for several months. In the past month the sputum has been blood-tinged. She feels otherwise well.What&#8217;s worrying is that it has persisted for several months, and there is hemoptysis.If this was elsewhere in the world, it would most likely be Tuberculosis.In Canada, this is more likely due to vessel rupture, either from a severe infection or a tumour.Since she otherwise feels well, you would want to ask other questions!What other questions would you ask?When is the onset of the cough? What makes it better/worse?Smoking and EtOH History!Appetite, weight, sleeping, possible presence of B-symptoms.We obtain the following information:Additional InformationShe has had some trouble sleeping because of the cough but her appetite, weight and other parameters are normal. She is a 60 pack/year smoker.Always ask if you&#8217;ve smoked/ever smoked if you have any patient with a respiratory condition!Since the patient is 65, and has a 60 pack year history of smoking, this means that she&#8217;s probably smoked a bit over a pack a year since she&#8217;s started smoking!What investigations would you like to do now?Assuming the physical exam is done, what diagnostic tests would be done?Always start with a Chest X-Ray (unless pregnant).The CXR shows a collapsed lung, where you don&#8217;t see the normal dark lung silhouette.The reason the lung has collapsed is because something has probably obstructed the left main bronchus.This gives us indirect evidence of a central mass (lesion).So we think we have a mass in the bronchus.What would your next step be?We could do a sputum sample since she obviously has a productive cough.The cells from the sputum sample could then be taken to cytology.This can often be sufficiently diagnostic!A wash/brush via bronchoscopy can also be done to ensure that the sample is from the lower airways.We could also do a bronchial biopsy, if you want a tissue sample.Since the mass is more likely to be central, rather than peripheral, it would be possible to take a biopsy via a bronchoscope, rather than having to do a mini-thoracotomy and an open lung biopsy.If you want tissue outside of the bronchi, we can do a transbronchial biopsy. This is useful if you want to go through the mass.ResultsIn this case, what we had was a squamous cell carcinoma.Normal squamous cells in the oral cavity should not have nuclei!Also, the respiratory epithelium has ciliated pseudostratified epithelium.These cells do not look like that because we have squamous metaplasia where the epithelia changes to become more resistant to damage from smoking (as seen in Introduction to Medicine).Case 2Case #2Mr S.A. is a 56 year old businessman with long standing history of heart problems due to coronary artery disease. His problems have included arrythmia for which he is on medication. In his most recent check-up, he complains of newly occurring shortness of breath with minimal exertion and at rest.Shortness of breath could be due to a cardiac problem or a pulmonary problem!As we&#8217;ve seen, cardiology and respirology are closely intertwined.Any additional questions?Smoking and EtOH use, as before &#8594; always ask about smoking!What medications he&#8217;s on.Upon questioning, we obtain the following:Additional InformationHe is not a smoker. He does not reveal additional information.Further Investigations?Chest X-Ray!CXR showed a diffuse infiltrate and a widened hilar region.There was a ground-glass appearance where it looks like someone put coarse glass over the lungs.This is because there&#8217;s something in the interstitium that affects the normally black appearance of the lung in the CXR.We also see a widened mediastinum, adjacent to the trachea.This is a sign of enlarged lymph nodes in the area &#8594; there is rich lymphoid tissue there!In his context, with an Hx of CAD, and arrhythmia, what possible conditions would he have?Right sided heart failure causing pulmonary edema would have a more striking presentation, and wouldn&#8217;t explain the lymph nodes.Could be due to his occupational history.Infectious processesInflammation due to other causes (drug side effects due to possible pulmonary toxicity)Tumour spreading via lymphatics.Vascular disease such as vasculitis.What diagnostic tests can be done?A sputum sample could never hurt.But here, we really need a piece of tissue, because we have a diverse differential!Since the CXR showed a ground glass appearance in the interstitium, we wouldn&#8217;t want to do a bronchial biopsy or a bronchoscopy.A transbronchial biopsy may work to get tissue in the lung parenchyma.A transthoracic lung biopsy can also be done. Just never show the patient the needle, because it&#8217;s really damn long!In some cases, we may require an surgical open lung biopsy, with a mini-thoracotomy (less invasive than a full thoracotomy).Here is an image of a lung at autopsy, for another patient who died of  the same condition.Note that we can see very large paratracheal lymph nodes.The large hilum is due to enlarged lymph nodes on the hilum as well.In our patient, a lung biopsy revealed the following:This was what we saw in Infection &#38; Immunity!We see large multinucleated macrophages &#8594; granulomas!This is suggestive of granulomatous inflammation.This patient had granulomas in the lungs, and granulomas in the lymph nodes.Elsewhere in the world, this would likely be due to Tuberculosis.Here in Canada, it&#8217;s more likely to be Sarcoidosis.Sarcoidosis has an unknown etiology, and is associated with granuloma formation in multiple organs (most typically the lungs).A lymph node biopsy is shown, where we see lots of small balls.Each one of these balls is actually a granuloma!Case 3Case #3Mrs M.M. is a 46 yr old secretary. She is well. She had a chest X-ray as part of her yearly physical and was told that a &#8220;shadow&#8221; had been found in her left lung that needed checking. She has no significant past clinical history and is a lifelong non-smoker.The chest x-ray, showing the peripheral nodule, is shown above.This came as a surprise, considering that she was a non-smoker, and had no significant past clinical history.Lung cancer in patients that do not smoke do exist, but they&#8217;re very rare!Here, we have a 3 cm peripheral nodule that must be examined.Diagnostic Strategies?We&#8217;ve already obtained a CXR, so ideally we&#8217;d like to obtain some tissue now.Since the nodule is peripheral, a bronchoscopy would not be useful.Here we&#8217;d probably have to go through the chest wall (don&#8217;t show that needle!).So in this case, a transthoracic core lung biopsy or an open lung biopsy would be used.The transthoracic core lung biopsy (with the long needle) would be preferred in this case because it&#8217;s less invasive, as described before.We could also do a FNAB if we don&#8217;t need tissue, and only want to do cytology to determine if it&#8217;s cancer or not.A FNAB is less invasive because the needle is a lot thinner.ResultsIn this case, the peripheral mass was a tumour right underneath the pleura.It turned out to be a malignant tumour of the peripheral lung.There is a type of peripheral lung tumours that arise in non-smokers &#8594; adenocarcinomas. (top right box below)These are more common in women than men.The etiology is unknown, but there is likely a genetic basis behind it.Case 4Case #4Mr RS is a 68 yr old retired auto mechanic presenting to ER with an 8 month history of increasing right chest pain (sharp) most recently associated with shortness of breath. He has no significant past medical or social history. He has never smoked.All his blood tests were normal.His Chest X-ray showed a large right pleural effusionAfter draining the effusion (of hemorrhagic turbid fluid), a repeat X-ray showed marked thickening of the pleura and multiple pleural nodulesAgain, this is atypical, because there&#8217;s no medical or social history that would be suggestive of a respiratory disease.Note that we do a repeat CXR after draining of the pleural effusion, because you can&#8217;t see any morphological features with fluid in the way!Once the fluid was removed, the patient&#8217;s SOB disappeared, but his sharp right chest pain remained.Further Diagnostic Tests?Since we see bumpy, abnormal pleura, we want to sample it!We could analyze the pleural fluid removed when we drained the effusion.Cells will shed into the fluid, and this allows us to diagnose what happened!The worst case scenario would be a mesothelioma &#8594; primary tumour of the mesothelium, eg. the pleura. This has an extremely poor prognosis.It could also potentially be a metastatic carcinoma that metastasized from another tissue.Diagnostic Approach?Sampling of the Pleura &#8594; pleural fluid to cytology.In this case, a tissue biopsy wasn&#8217;t needed to make a diagnosis, because we could see evidence of mesothelioma in the pleural fluid.Cytological features of epithelioid Mesothelioma. We see lots of large cells, which are on the surface of the pleura.We can also stain cells with markers such as calretinin which are specific to mesothelial cells.Stains of the pleural fluid with markers specific for mesothelial cells.Since mesotheliomas are often caused by prolonged asbestos exposure, patients can often get financial compensation.However, to be entitled to this compensation, a definitive tissue biopsy diagnosis needs to be done.Below is an image of a tissue biopsy taken from this patient.Any Additional Questions?Mesotheliomas are classically caused by asbestos exposure.As a result, you would ask about the patient&#8217;s history of asbestos exposure!You would ask more questions about his occupational history:Asbestos was used in the past in pottery, fire resistant clothes, oil lamp wicks.It&#8217;s also used for brake lining, insulation, construction, tiles, cement, etc.The disease may also occur in the families of those who handle asbestos.Asbestos can cause all sorts of malignancies, not just mesotheliomas!Of course, mesotheliomas are the most infamous, because it&#8217;s rare, and almost always pathognomonic of asbestos exposure!Take Home PointsAlways ask about smoking history in a patient with a respiratory condition.Always order a Chest X-Ray first!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/26/respiratory-pathology-histology.html"},
	{"title": "Gas Diffusion &amp; Transport", "text": "Gas diffusion across a membrane depends on a number of factors, including surface area, membrane thickness, diffusibility of the gas, and the pressure gradient across the membrane. This is encapsulated in Fick's Law.Gas DiffusionGas Diffusion OutlineFick&#8217;s LawOxygen Time Course (normal and abnormal)Carbon Dioxide Time Course (normal and abnormal)Fick&#8217;s LawDiffusion is the process by which gas goes from the alveolar space into the capillaries, and vice versa.Diffusion through a membrane is determined by:Surface Area &#8594; diffusion is proportional to membrane surface area.Thickness &#8594; diffusion is proportional to 1/thickness.Diffusibility of the Gas &#8594; diffusion is proportional to diffusibility.Pressure Gradient &#8594; diffusion is proportional to pressure gradient.In other words, we have the following proportionality:	Fick's Law	$$V_{gas} \propto \frac{AD \big( P_1 - P_2 \big)}{T}$$Where we have that:A = surface area.T = thickness.D = gas diffusibility.P1 - P2 = pressure gradient.In the case of the lung, the membrane is the alveolar wall, which is composed of:Alveolar cellsThe interstitium between the alveolar cells and the endothelium.Endothelial cells &#8594; the wall of the capillary.Gas exchange must pass through these three layers of the alveolar wall.Oxygen Diffusion in the LungIt takes around 3/4 of a second for an erythrocyte to traverse through an alveolus.Pulmonary arterial PO2 (also known as mixed venous PO2) is usually around 40 mmHg &#8594; blood enters the alveolus with a PO2 of around 40.Inside the alveolus, the PO2 is about 100 mmHg.The red cell quickly equilibrates with the alveolus, and it does this in about 1/4 of a second &#8594; about a third of the time it takes passing through the alveolus.This is good, the RBC fills up with oxygen with plenty of time before it has to leave the alveolus!However, there are factors that can affect the uptake of O2 by the RBCs:A diseased (thickened) membrane slows diffusion across the alveolar wall, reducing oxygen uptake. In extreme cases, the RBC may not even be able to fully equilibrate by the time it passes through the alveolus!Exercise decreases the transit time by increasing flow (CO). This means that the RBC has less time through the alveolus.A lower \( P_AO_2 \) also slows diffusion by reducing the gradient, as well as by causing hypoxic vasoconstriction, reducing the surface area, slowing diffusion (Recall Fick&#8217;s Law).So if you have a patient with a thickened membrane undergoing strenous exercise, you can have a synergistic effect that markedly reduces equilibration &#8594; arterial hypoxemia.This can cause a larger alveolar-arterial gradient.Because this is quite common, we can never assume that \( P_AO_2 = P_aO_2 \)!Summary of Oxygen DiffusionThickened Membrane slows diffusion.Exercise decreases transit time.Lower PAO2 slows diffusion.Carbon Dioxide Diffusion in the LungCO2 diffusion is simpler than with O2, because it&#8217;s a much more diffusible gas.Because of this, although the gradient may be low (only 5 mmHg), it&#8217;s so diffusible that we rarely run into situations where diffusion is impaired enough to cause problems.We only see an AA CO2 gradient (aleveolar-arterial gradient) in extremely rare cases, so we basically always assume that the alveolar and arterial partial pressures of carbon dioxide are identical.This is why we said earlier that we could always assume that \(P_ACO_2 = P_aCO_2\)!Gas TransportGas Transport OutlineTransport of OxygenO2 carriageO2 dissociation curveTotal O2 transport to the tissuesSignificance of O2 dissociation curveFactors affecting O2 dissociation curveTransport of Carbon DioxideCO2 carriageCO2 dissociation curveGas transport is the process by which gases are transferred to and from the lungs and the systemic circulation.Transport of OxygenThe Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation CurveAs we saw before, the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is a cooperative process, resulting in a sigmoid binding curve.We ideally want patients on the &#8216;flat&#8217; part of the curve, because they will have a steady oxygen saturation across a wide range of arterial oxygen partial pressures.That&#8217;s why we want their \( P_aO_2 > 60 \) mmHg!However, we generally more directly assess oxygen saturation by measuring it itself (via. a sat monitor) &#8594; it&#8217;s easier to measure saturations than it is to measure arterial gases!A \( P_aO_2 > 60 \) corresponds to an \( S_aO_2 > 90%\), approximately.This is what we write in orders &#8594; titrate the FIO2 to keep the SaO2 greater than 90%.The curve can be shifted &#8594; increasing/decreasing avidity.The advantage of shifting the curve to the right is that oxygen is more easily unloaded.The advantage of shifting the curve to the left is that oxygen is more easily loaded.Clinically, we generally aim to shift the curve to the right to increase unloading of oxygen.Factors that Shift the Curve Right&#8593; H+ (called the Bohr Effect)&#8593; PaCO2 (fall in pH)&#8593; Temperature&#8593; 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) in the RBC (increases in chronic hypoxemia)Factors that Shift the Curve Left&#8595; H+&#8595; PaCO2 (rise in pH)&#8595; Temperature&#8595; 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) in the RBCIn a systemic acidotic environment, the RBC will rapidly unload its oxygen, and return to an alkalotic environment like the lungs, where it will more rapidly load oxygen &#8594; this is the Bohr Effect.In other words, we use this shift of the curve to abet the loading and loading of oxygen onto RBCs!The Bohr EffectIn acidotic environments, hemoglobin binds O2 poorly &#8594; O2 unloading.In alkalotic environments, hemoglobin binds O2 strongly &#8594; CO2 loading.Faster loading isn't as important because RBC equilibration normally only takes 1/4 of a second, while an RBC takes 3/4 seconds to pass through an alveoli &rarr; there's lots of time for oxygen to load!2-3 DPG is produced in response to chronic hypoxemia, and triggers faster unloading of oxygen off your hemoglobin.This is somewhat counterintuitive &#8594; you&#8217;d expect 2-3 DPG to trigger improved oxygen binding in response to chronic hypoxemia.However, faster unloading is a more significant effect that faster binding!Oxygen Transport to the TissuesSince the amount of dissolved oxygen is almost negligible (see right), compared to the bound oxygen, we generally ignore it.In other words, the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is significantly higher than the amount dissolved in the blood itself.We saw this before, when we developed the following equation for oxygen delivery.Oxygen Delivery = (Flow)L/min &#215; ((Hbg/L &#215; SaO2 &#215; 1.34) + 0.03 &#215; paO2)Back then we generally ignored the second term because it was a minor contributor to oxygen content.Oxygen Saturation only assesses what percentage of hemoglobin oxygen binding sites are bound.We measure oxygen saturation with an oximeter, but when you do a blood gas, you measure the partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in the blood.But as we said before, this dissolved oxygen is only a tiny component of the total oxygen content!So how is this useful?The dissolved oxygen only accounts for an infintesimally small proportion of the total oxygen content!However, we infer the total oxygen content because we know the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve &#8594; we know binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is affected by \( P_aO_2 \)!Hence, when we measure a \( P_aO_2 = 60\), we don&#8217;t care about what this means about the dissolved oxygen content, but we do care about what this means with respect to the Hb-dissociation curve.Note that this means that when we measure arterial gases, we are indirectly measuring hemoglobin saturation!This also does not tell us what the oxygen content is:We know how saturated each hemoglobin molecule is from the Hb-dissociation curve. (and even this may not be the case if we don't have a normal Hb-dissociation curve, eg. with a hemoglobinopathy).We don&#8217;t know how many hemoglobin molecules there are! For that we need to know the Hb (g/L).So in the case of a patient with anemia, they could have 100% saturation, but still be hypoxic (see figure below).Consider the following (hypothetical) case where we have a patient with a single red blood cell:The partial pressure of the dissolved oxygen will be normal because we have normal plasma, and a normal fractional inspired oxygen.The oxygen saturation will also be normal for that one RBC.However, the oxygen content will be low because the Hb is low!So we can have a case where we have normal saturation and normal PaO2, but a low oxygen content!So even though we measure saturations extremely frequently (it&#8217;s basically the fifth vital nowadays), as well as partial pressures, they may not always tell us what the patient&#8217;s oxygen content is!Question 1Arterial blood gases reveal the following information: PaO2 = 60 mmHg, pH = 7.40, PaCO2 = 40 mmHg, and SaO2 =0.90 (90%). The Hb is 150 g/L. Calculate the CaO2. Remember with the reduced PaO2 the Hb is only 90% saturated.Using our equation:Question 2A victim of CO poisoning presents to the emergency department with headaches and confusion. The COHb level in his blood is 50%. Arterial blood gases on room air reveal a PaO2 of of 95 mmHg, a PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and a pH of 7.20. The hemoglobin level is 150 grams/L. Calculate his CaO2. Why is the pH low?Carbon Monoxide Poisoning &#8594; carbon monoxide binds hemoglobin with high avidity and essentially renders that binding site inaccessible.You can actually measure the amount of carboxyhemoglobin with a blood test.Using the same equation and process as before:Compare this value of 104, versus the 183 we saw previously with an even lower PaO2 of 60 mmHg!The key here is that the saturation is 0.5 &#8594; half of the binding sites have been occupied by CO (COHb = 50%)!Why is the patient acidotic?Without oxygen, the patient can&#8217;t perform oxidative respiration, so we go through anaerobic respiration instead.Since this causes pyruvate to be converted to lactic acid during fermentation, we end up with a buildup of lactic acid causing lactic acidosis.When we measure the serum lactate, we would expect it to be elevated.Note that the patient should be hyperventilating in this case because of the peripheral chemoreceptor response to hypoxia.However, this is not reflected in the question itself, because the PaCO2 is not decreased as you would expect.Transport of Carbon DioxideJust like with oxygen, only a small portion (5%) is dissolved in the blood.5-10% is associated with carbamino compounds &#8594; bound to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin.Most of the carbon dioxide is tranported in the blood as bicarbonate.This is useful clinically because an increase in blood bicarbonate is an early indicator of hypercarbia.CO2 and O2 in the presence of carbonic anhydrase, forms carbonic acid, which dissociates into bicarbonate anion and protons in solution:$$H_2O + CO_2 \rightarrow H_2CO_3 \rightarrow HCO_3^- + H^+$$Carbonic anhydrase is only present in red cells.Just like there&#8217;s an oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, there&#8217;s a carboxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.Just like the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, this curve can shift as well.We use this physiologically to our advantage so that in an oxygen rich environment, hemoglobin binds CO2 more poorly, than in an oxygen poor environment &#8594; this is known as the Haldane Effect.This is very similar to the Bohr Effect we saw earlier.We use this to our advantage to facilitate the transfer of CO2 from oxygen poor locations in the systemic circulation to the oxygen rich lungs.The Haldane EffectIn oxygen rich environments, hemoglobin binds CO2 poorly &#8594; CO2 unloading.In oxygen poor environments, hemoglobin binds CO2 strongly &#8594; CO2 loading.In fact, we use shifting of both the oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin dissociation curves to facilitate gas transport in the body:Gas Transport in the BodyIn the BodyMetabolically active tissues are producing CO2, and want oxygen.Since CO2 is freely diffusible, it diffuses into the plasma, and easily diffuses into the red cell.Once it enters the red cell, in the presence of carbonic anhydrase (which is only present in the RBC), this CO2 is converted to H2CO3, which dissociates into H+ and HCO3-.The H+ ions are bound to the hemoglobin so they aren&#8217;t free in solution.The bicarbonate anions enter the plasma via an ion exchange protein, which lets chloride into the RBC.In other words:Bicarbonate (HCO3-) enters the plasma.Chloride (Cl-) enters the RBC.The hemoglobin senses that it&#8217;s in an oxygen poor environment, and as a result, unloads its oxygen more readily.This then means that we have free hemoglobin, which can bind the H+ ions and the CO2 molecules.The hemoglobin then returns to the lungs as either:Reduced Hemoglobin (bound to H+ ions)Carboxyhemoglobin (bound to CO2)The CO2 is carried in the plasma as bicarbonate anion.In the LungOnce we return to the lungs, we&#8217;re in an oxygen rich environment, with a low partial pressure of CO2.This causes another shift of the oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, causing the hemoglobin to bind O2, and release of the CO2 and H+.The hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions, in the presence of the carbonic anhydrase present in the RBCs, is converted back to CO2 and H2O, which leaves through the alveolus.So this interplay between the dissociation curves facilitates transfer of gases from the systemic circulation to the lungs!Note that the uptake of bicarbonate back into the erythrocyte requires the exchange of chloride back out into the plasma. This causes a chloride shift.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/26/gas-diffusion-transport.html"},
	{"title": "Pulmonary Circulation", "text": "An outline of the factors regulating perfusion of the lung. These include gravity, west zones, and hypoxic vasoconstriction. For instance, blood flow generally shows an apex-to-base gradient due to the impact of gravity.Lecture OutlineThe previous lectures focused on ventilation, and the control of ventilation.Today&#8217;s lecture will focus on what happens on the other end &#8594; perfusion.PressureNormal valuesCauses of increased pressureResistanceCalculationRecruitmentDistensionFlowMeasurement - Fick&#8217;s principleDistribution - Apex to base gradientWest Zones - Important to understand!Hypoxic VasoconstrictionPulmonary EdemaPressureThe pulmonary circulation is in series with the systemic circulation, but it is a low pressure circuit.The pressures in the pulmonary circulation is about a sixth of the pressure of the systemic circulation. (15 mmHg vs. 100 mmHg)The reason for this is pretty obvious &#8594; the systemic circulation must perfuse the entire body, so there&#8217;s more resistance.Mathematically, since the two systems are in series, the cardiac output (flow) is the same. But since \( F = P/R \) this reduced pressure must mean that the resistance must also be lower as well.As a consequence of this, the blood vessels of the pulmonary circulation are much thinner-walled.Also, this means that the right side of the heart is a lower pressure system, resulting in a less hypertrophied RV.This means that the RV is less capable of responding to sudden increases in pressure compared to the LV.This will lead to acute right heart failure and death!Two important effects of an increased PAP (Pulmonary Arterial Pressure) are:Pulmonary Edema &#8594; increased hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid out of the pulmonary circulation.Right Ventricular Strain &#8594; due to increased afterload.ResistanceAs we saw in Heart &#38; Circulation, we can calculate vascular resistance as follows:	The Pulmonary Vascular Resistance	$$PVR = \frac{\overline{P_{pa}} - \overline{P_{pv}}}{CO}$$	The Systemic Vascular Resistance	$$SVR = \frac{\overline{SAP} - \overline{CVP}}{CO}$$PVR = Pulmonary Vascular Resistance.Ppa = Pulmonary Arterial Pressure.Ppv = Pulmonary Venous Pressure.SVR = Systemic Vascular Resistance.SAP = Systemic Arterial Pressure.CVP = Central Venous Pressure (can be non-invasively approximated with the JVP)You take the upstream pressure, minus the downstream pressure, and divide it by the flow.This makes sense, since \( R = P/F \).Generally, we&#8217;re not actually interested in the vascular resistance, but more so the pulmonary pressure &#8594; we want to know if their pulmonary pressure has increased.We can obtain this by rearranging the equation for the PVR:	The Pulmonary Artery Pressure	$$P_{pa} = (CO \times PVR) + P_{pv}$$We mentioned that the RV is poorly equipped to deal with sudden increases in pulmonary pressure.But how does this work during exercise, when the cardiac output is easily doubled or tripled? (\( CO = P/R \)).If we doubled or tripled the pulmonary pressure, we would die!Hence we need coping mechanisms to avoid this acute right heart failure.The mechanisms to maintain pulmonary pressures with increased cardiac output are:Recruitment &#8594; Perfusion of previously unperfused capillary vessels.Distension &#8594; Stretching of previously perfused vessels.The goal of both of these is to increase the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed, to decrease the pulmonary vascular resistance.In other words, when we have increased flow, we use recruitment and distension to lower the PVR, rather than increasing the pulmonary pressure.ExampleA patient presents with an elevated pulmonary aterial pressure. What are the possible causes?Since we had that \(P_{pa} = (CO \times PVR) + P_{pv}\), this could be due to:CO &#8593; &#8594; an increase in flow (CO).PVR &#8593; &#8594; an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.PVP &#8593; &#8594; an increase in pulmonary venous pressure.An Increase in FlowThe most common cause is congenital heart disease, namely the left to right shuntsVentricular Septal Defects (VSDs)Atrial Septal Defects (ASDs)Hence, when we see a patient with pulmonary hypertension, we always look for signs of ASDs and VSDs, (Systolic murmur at the base with a wide fixed S2, or a systolic murmur at the border with an parasternal thrill).An Increase in Pulmonary Vascular ResistanceMany things can increase pulmonary vascular resistance, but the archetypical one is a pulmonary embolism.A pulmonary embolism decreases the cross sectional area by blocking off perfusion to an area, which increases resistance!If this persists for long enough, the sustained Ppa can cause right sided heart failure.An Increase in Pulmonary Venous PressureThings that increase downstream pressure &#8594; ie. &#8216;afterload&#8217; to the pulmonary circulation.The causes of these make sense &#8594; anything that impedes flow out of the pulmonary veins and LA.Left Heart Failure &#8594; the most common cause in the world!Mitral StenosisPulmonary Venous HypertensionHence, when a patient presents with pulmonary hypertension, we also assess the patency of the aortic and mitral valves to ensure that they&#8217;re not stenotic or regurgitant.FlowHow do you measure the pulmonary blood flow?We use something known as the Fick Principle:	Fick's Principle	$$ \dot{V}_{O_2} = \dot{Q} \times (CaO_2 - CvO_2) $$Where we have that:The \( \dot{V}_{O_2} \) is the O2 consumption per mintue.The \( \dot{Q} \) is the blood flow through the lungs per minute.The \( CaO_2 \) is the O2 content of the systemic arterial blood.The \( CvO_2 \) is the O2 content of the blood entering the lungs.This equation takes advantage of values that are easily measured clinically, so it&#8217;s used commonly.This makes intuitive sense:To assess how much oxygen we&#8217;re consuming per minute, we want to look at how much oxygen is lost between when the blood enters the systemic circulations, and when it returns to the lungs.We multiply this difference by the flow rate, to determine the oxygen consumption per minute.Rearranging, to solve for the flow:	Flow Equation	$$ \dot{Q} = \dot{V}_{O_2}/ \big( CaO_2 - CvO_2 \big)$$What affects flow distribution?Broadly speaking, there are 3 things that affect the distribution of blood flow within the lungs:1. GravityIf you plot blood flow versus lung distance below rib 2, we see an increase in blood flow the lower we go, because of the effect of gravity.Hence, as expected, the greatest blood flow is at the base, and the lowest blood flow is at the apex.This gives us an apex to base gradient.Note: The axis is going in the opposite direction from what you'd normally expect in the figure on the right.We also have some logical corollaries to this:If you&#8217;re lying on your left side, you&#8217;ll have more blood flow to your left lung than your right lung.If you do a handstand, the apex-to-base gradient is inverted.If you&#8217;re in space, you&#8217;ll have a uniform distribution of blood flow in your lung!We use this clinically, where we want to augment or diminish blood flow to a lung.For instance, as we saw in PCCM, when we want to determine whether dullness to percussion is due to pulmonary edema or something like pulmonary fibrosis.2. West Lung ZonesThis has to do with the interplay between pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary venous pressure, and alveolar pressure.The lung is divided into what&#8217;s known as West Lung Zones, after Dr. John West (the author of Essentials of Respiratory Physiology).This refers to three zones in the lungs, which are not anatomically defined. Although Zone 1 will be higher than Zone 2, which will be higher than Zone 3, they cannot be landmarked.Rather, these are physiologic zones:Zone 1Where alveolar pressure is greater than arterial pressure, which is in turn greater than venous pressure.Since the alveolar pressure is greater than both the intervascular pressures, there will not be any blood flow to those areas of the lung.We have ventilation but no perfusion here &#8594; this is alveolar dead space!$$ P_A > P_a > P_v $$In most normal lungs, we don&#8217;t have any Zone 1.There are pathological states where we do have Zone 1s present, for instance an increase in alveolar pressure with mechanical ventilation.Another example would be a patient who is hypovolemic, and has reduced pulmonary arterial and venous pressures.Zone 2Where arterial pressure is greater than the alveolar pressure, which is in turn greater than the venous pressure.This is a much more common condition.Here, the difference between Pa and PA is what determines blood flow.Hence, as we go down the lung from apex to base, the flow will increase in Zone 2, because the arterial pressure will increase but the alveolar pressure will remain the same.$$ P_a > P_A > P_v $$Zone 3This is analogous to the systemic circulation, where it&#8217;s the difference between the arterial and venous pressures that determines blood flow, namely Pa and Pv.This is because both are greater than the alveolar pressure.West Lung Zones are somewhat analogous to how the systemic circulation works, except that there&#8217;s a third pressure we have to consider.$$ P_a > P_v > P_A $$3. Hypoxic VasoconstrictionThis is probably the most physiologically important determinant of pulmonary flow.Suppose there&#8217;s an incomplete blockage to one of the lung bodies, diminishing ventilation distal to it.As a consequence, because ventilation has decreased, the PCO2 will rise, and the PO2 will fall regionally.What happens as a result is hypoxic vasoconstriction &#8594; the vessels perfusing the area sense the fall in PO2, and results in vessel constriction.This is a critical mechanism we have of matching perfusion with ventilation!Say a patient has a foreign body in their right main stem bronchus completely occluding ventilation to the right lung.As a consequence of hypoxic vasoconstriction, gas exchange functions is still somewhat effective, because the areas that are poorly ventilated are vasoconstricted in favour of regions that still have gas exchange.This works extremely well in normal physiology, to maintain PO2 levels.However, in pathologies where we have global alveolar hypoxia, such as in a diffuse lung disease such as emphysema, we end up with global vasoconstriction.This increases pulmonary resistance &#8594; pulmonary arterial pressure &#8593;.In other words, systemic hypoxia can lead to right sided heart failure due to global hypoxic vasoconstriction!Hence, pulmonary hypertension is a bad sign!The figure on the right shows that survival is worse when a patient has elevated pulmonary blood pressures.Pulmonary EdemaAs we saw in Heart &#38; Circulation, fluid filtration in the lung depends on a balance between hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure:$$Q_f = K_f \big[(P_{mv} - P_i) - \sigma_f(\pi_{mv} - \pi_{i}) \big]$$Where we have that:Pmv is the microvascular hydrostatic pressurePi is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure&#960;mv is the microvascular oncotic pressure&#960;i is the interstitial oncotic pressureKf is the filtration coefficient &#8212; a proportionality constant&#963;f is the reflection coefficientCardiogenic Pulmonary EdemaIn cardiogenic pulmonary edema, there&#8217;s an increase in hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vasculature due to left sided heart failure, which forces fluid from the intravascular spaces into the airways.This is by far the most common form of pulmonary edema.Non-Cardiogenic Pulmonary EdemaIn non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, we have fluid exudation from the pulmonary vasculature into the air spaces due to leakiness of the vasculature in some way.In this case, there&#8217;s no increase in pressure, there&#8217;s just junctional leakage.This can be seen in patients with sepsis, with histamine-mediated junctional retraction, for instance.This is generally more lethal, and more difficult to treat than cardiogenic pulmonary edema.Above is a CXR of a patient with pulmonary edema secondary to CHF.Note that cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema look the same!The only differentiating factor would be that the intravascular pulmonary pressure would be normal with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.This would be reflected in a normal LVESV, or a normal Ppa.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/26/pulmonary-circulation.html"},
	{"title": "Respiratory Pathology Independent Learning", "text": "A general review of how tissues are sampled in the respiratory tract, and the structural features of the lung. We will cover different sources of samples, types of samples for diagnosis, and types of pleural fluid accumulations.Basic Respiratory HistologySources of SpecimensThere are 4 different anatomical sources for specimens:AirwaysRespiratory infections/inflammation are the most common.It is also possible to have tumours here.Lung parenchymaCan also have inflammatory/infectious conditions (pneumonia).Could also have tumours or diseases of the interstitium.You can also see vascular diseases from the lung parenchyma.PleuraMostly looking for tumours here.Could be primary (malignant mesothelioma), or malignant.Could also have atypical presentations, eg. inflammatory pleuritis.LymphaticsMost typically inflammatory/infectious.Could also be a tumour.The AirwaysThe upper airways include the Nose &#8594; Nasopharynx &#8594; Larynx &#8594; tracheaThe lower airways include the bronchi down to the terminal bronchioles.Airway HistologyHistology of the airways is generally simple.There&#8217;s a mucosal covering made of pseudostratified ciliated epithelium.Underneath this, there&#8217;s usually a muscular coatUnderneath this, there are mucosal glandsAfter this there is cartilage.When we get to smaller airways such as the bronchioles, you will still see the mucosa, muscles, and glands, but the cartilage will mostly disappear.Some bronchioles may still have cartilage, but by the time we reach the terminal bronchiole, there will be no cartilage!As the airways get smaller, they begin to develop protrusions, which eventually become alveoli.Beyond the terminal bronchioles, we now have the lung parenchyma.At the lung parenchyma we have:Respiratory bronchiolesAlveolar ductsAlveoli &#8594; seen right.You can see capillaries in the alveolar wall, where RBCs flow through and participate in gas exchange.Lung Circulation HistologyThe lung is fed by dual circulation from both the pulmonary system and the bronchial circulationWe can tell the difference between the two because the pulmonary arteries is a branch of the great vessels, and will contain many layers of elastic fibres, which can be stained (with a silver stain, they will look silver).This looks like a meshwork of dark fibres.Comparatively, the bronchial arteries, which are muscular arteries coming out of the aorta, only have two layers of elastic fibres &#8594; the internal elastic lamina and the external elastic lamina.The rest of the bronchial artery will be muscle.Different stages of a Pulmonary Embolism can be seen histologically.In a fresh embolism, you will still see RBCs, and it still won&#8217;t be completely attached to the wall.In a more mature embolism, you&#8217;ll see fewer RBCs, and it&#8217;ll be attached to the walls of the vessel.In a very mature embolism, there will be fibrosis due to &#8216;organization&#8217; of the embolism.Sometimes, an embolus can be recanalized to restore blood flow across an embolus!The PleuraThere are two layers of pleura:Visceral Pleura which is attached to the lungs, and isn&#8217;t sensitive to pain or sensation.Parietal Pleura which is attached to the underside of the ribs.The space between the two is the pleural space, and usually only has a minimal amount of fluid.This forms a double layer of membrane around the lungs.Whenever you see dark blue fibres in a histological image, this reflects elastic tissue.We used this previously to distinguish the pulmonary circulation (where vessels have several layers of elastic fibres), and the bronchial circulation (where vessels only have two elastic layers, and lots of muscle)Pleural FluidsNormally, there is little fluid in the pleural space.When there is excess fluid, this is pleural effusion.Different types of pleural effusions have different names:Hydrothorax: Edema fluid. This could be due to increased hydrostatic pressure (eg. in pulmonary hypertension), or reduced oncotic pressure (eg. in protein malnutrition).Pyothorax: Pus. This is usually suggestive of an abcess somewhere. Often the result of pneumonia or possibly a penetrating wound infection. When the pus thickens and scars, it is called emphysemaHemothorax: Blood. Typically due to trauma or vessel rupture.Chylothorax: Milky lymph accumulation due to lymphatic obstruction. It is potentially ominous since lymphatic obstruction is usually the result of diseases of the lymph nodes in the region (lymphoma or carcinoma).Inflammation of the pleura is known as pleuritis.The LymphaticsLymphatic vessels look like capillaries except instead of containing blood, they contain lymph, which is proteinaceous fluid that is acellular (except with the occasional lymphocyte).The image on the right shows what lymph looks like histologically.Diagnostic SamplingHow do you sample all these structures, and send them to a pathology lab for diagnosis?1. The Sputum SampleDeep cough, and spit into a container.We desire a sample from the bronchi, and not the oral cavity.The pathology lab has to find cells from the lungs and not from the mouth &#8594; look for alveolar macrophages! (pictured)If you don&#8217;t see any alveolar macrophages, it may be possible that the patient did not cough deeply enough, and all we got was a saliva sample.What can we see in sputum?Fungi &#8594; in the image to the right, we see an example of a blastomycosis fungi. This is pretty rare, but we can also see more common fungi such as Candida and Aspergillus.Malignant Cells2. Washes, Brushes, LavagesThese are somewhat more invasive.Involve inserting a bronchoscope down from the upper airways into the lower airways.This allows for forcible flushing of the cells.The bronchoscope introduces saline very low in the lower airways, which flushes cells forcibly.It&#8217;s a common procedure in patients with infections or tumours.This fluid is sucked out and can be sent to cytology.A bronchoscope is useful in detecting central tumours, but it&#8217;s not effective when the tumour is more distal, at a point where the bronchoscope can&#8217;t reach.3. Lung BiopsyIf we have a more peripheral lesion, or we need a tissue sample, we perform a lung biopsy.This involves inserting a biopsy needle through the ribs.I. Fine Needle Aspiration BiopsyThe Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) gives you a cell aspirate.Typically involves the aid of radiology, and is X-ray guided.A needle is inserted trans-thoracically.Useful for peripheral lesions far from the main bronchi.It&#8217;s more objective, and has a low associated morbidity/mortality.Fluid from the pleural space can also be analyzed to Dx inflammation, infections, and tumours.II. Bronchial BiopsiesAs said before, if you need to assess structural features, you shouldn&#8217;t do a FNAB since that will only give you an aspirate.One type of tissue sample is a bronchial biopsy, where we sample the bronchial wall.This is usually used to look for malignant cells, when assessing tumours.III. Transbronchial BiopsiesIn some cases, instead of requiring tissue in the bronchus, we need tissue around the bronchus.In other words, we want to sample the lung parenchyma.Rather than obtaining this tissue surgically, which is more invasive, we use a bronchoscope to penetrate a bronchus and go into the lung parenchyma.This is mainly used to study interstitial lung diseases.This is rarely used for tumours.Tissue samples are typically small, only a few millimetres across, but are often sufficient to diagnose interstitial lung disease.IV. Open Lung BiopsiesHere, we actually do have surgical sampling of the lung.A mini-thoracotomy is done, where two ribs are separated, and a sample is taken between them.However, because this is more invasive, there is a higher morbidity.Used when transbronchial biopsies are not successful or not possible.For diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases, some infections, or occasionally for tumours.This gives you a much larger tissue sample than a transbronchial biopsy.V. Core BiopsiesCore biopsies are where you insert a wide needle that bores through the tissue to get a tissue sample.This gives you a tissue sample non-invasively.We saw this in the diagnosis of lymphomas in Blood.VI. Pleural BiopsiesPleural biopsies are usually done for the diagnosis of tumours.Only occasionally done for dust diseases, infections, inflammation, etc.VII. Lymph Node BiopsiesMediastinal, paratracheal, or even supraclavicular lymph nodes can be sampled for diagnosis and/or staging.An LN biopsy is critical in determining the progression of a neoplasm!Usually involves surgery guided by a mediastinoscopy (scoping of the mediastinum).Ancillary Histological Findings1. Asbestos BodyAsbestos Bodies are characteristically brown, and look like &#8216;dumbbells&#8217;.They&#8217;re brown because they&#8217;re covered with iron from bleeding.Inside these structures are asbestos fibres.These are a sign of asbestos exposure.2. Foreign BodyThe image on the right shows vegetable cells, in this case from carrots.These can often be tricky histologically, because they can easily be confused with lesions/tumours.3. TalcSometimes, we can see deposits of talc.This is often seen in drug users who are grinding tablets, which often contain talc, and are then injecting them into their veins.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/25/respiratory-pathology-il.html"},
	{"title": "Pleura &amp; Lungs Anatomy Lab", "text": "The respiratory system consists of a series of air conducting passages, namely the nasal cavities, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles. The trachea originates below the cricoid cartilage of the larynx.The respiratory system consists of a series of air conducting passages, namely the nasal cavities, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles.The trachea originates below the cricoid cartilage of the larynx.It descends from the neck, through the thoracic inlet to enter the mediastinum, where it lies in the midline, anterior to the oesophagus.At about the T4 vertebral level the trachea divides into the right and left primary bronchi which leave the mediastinum to enter the lungs at the hilum, together with the nerves and blood vessels.The lungs, which contain the respiratory alveoli, extend into the right and left pleural cavities.Each lung is covered by a serous membrane &#8594; visceral pleura, which extends as a sac to line the thoracic wall and other thoracic structures as parietal pleura.The LungsGeneral FeaturesThe right lung is usually larger, but shorter, than the left.Each lung has three surfaces:A costal surface, directed toward the rib cage. Costal = ribs.A diaphragmatic surface, facing the diaphragmA mediastinal surface, facing the mediastinum (facing medially).The apex of the lung is the upper part which protrudes into the root of the neck.The root of the lung is located on the mediastinal surface, ie. the part facing the centre.Right LungA horizontal and an oblique fissure divide it into upper, middle and lower lobes.Left LungAn oblique fissure divides it into just upper and lower lobes.There is an anterior deficiency in the left lung, over the heart, known as the cardiac notch.Just below the cardiac notch is a tongue-like projection of the upper lobe, the lingula. This can be seen in the above figure, where the lung folds back out right past where the heart ends.The visceral pleura covering the lung follows its contours and hence extends into the fissures.Features of the LungsThe left lung has an oblique fissure separating it into an upper lobe and a lower lobe.The right lung has an oblique fissure and a horizontal fissure separating it into an upper lobe, middle lobe, and a lower lobe.The space where the heart occupies leaves a space in the left lung called the cardiac notch.At the bottom of the left lung, where the cardiac notch ends, is a tongue-like protrusion called the lingula.The Root (Hilum) of the LungThe structures of the lung hilum. Surrounding the lung hilum is the transition between the parietal and visceral pleura.The root of each lung contains the structures passing between the lung and mediastinum. They are:The pulmonary artery, carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart.The pulmonary veins, carrying oxygenated blood from the lung.The primary (left) or secondary (right) bronchus, transporting air.The left lung has one bronchial impression while the right lung has two bronchial impressions because the right bronchus branches earlier with respect to the lung.The bronchial arteries, which supply the bronchi and bronchioles. These branch mostly from the thoracic aorta, and provide dual circulation for the lungs.The bronchial veins, draining the lung tissue. They drain into the azygos/hemiazygos veins.autonomic nerve fibres from the pulmonary plexus: sympathetic innervation comes from the sympathetic ganglion/trunk; parasympathetic innervation comes from the vagus &#8594; these are pretty obvious sources of sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation (the sympathetic chain and the vagus nerve).lymphatics, draining the lung directly or via pulmonary lymph nodes which lie in the substance of the lung.All the above structures are enclosed within a sleeve of pleura which hangs inferiorly in a fold known as the pulmonary ligament.Lymphatic Drainage of the LungsPulmonary nodes drain into lymph nodes at the following locations:Bronchopulmonary nodes &#8594; at the hilum, where the bronchi meet the lungs.Superior and inferior tracheobronchial nodes &#8594; at the junctions where the trachea branches into the bronchi.Paratracheal nodes &#8594; lateral to the tracheaBronchomediastinal lymph trunk (not shown)Thoracic duct (left) or Right Lymphatic duct (not shown)Brachiocephalic veins (not shown)Tracheal BranchingThe right primary bronchus is more vertical than the left.Each primary bronchus divides into secondary bronchi.On the right side there are normally three secondary bronchi, each of which enters a different lobe of the lung, and on the left, there are two - one for each lobe.In other words, the number of secondary bronchi equal the number of lobes for each lung.Within each lobe the secondary bronchi divide into a number of tertiary or segmental bronchi. Each segmental bronchus subdivides into bronchioles and alveoli which form a specific, named segment of the lung, known as a bronchopulmonary segment (10 in the right lung; 8-9 in the left). Each segment has its own branch of a pulmonary artery and vein. This is of clinical significance because individual segments can be removed surgically, without causing irreparable damage to the remainder of the lung.The PleuraThe pleural cavities are lined by a thin, delicate serous membrane called parietal pleura.The parietal pleura is named according to the surface it lines, similarly to the lung surfaces:A costal surface, directed toward the rib cage. Costal = ribs.A diaphragmatic surface, facing the diaphragmA mediastinal surface, facing the mediastinum(facing medially).Superiorly, the parietal pleura rests on a layer of fascia extending medially from the inner margin of the first rib and is known as the cervical pleura or cupola.The lungs do not actually lie in the pleural cavities &#8594; the mediastinal pleura actually wraps around the lungs as the serous visceral pleura.In other words, the lungs are wrapped by the same pleura that wraps around the mediastinum.The pleural cavities are the potential spaces between the parietal and visceral pleurae and normally the two layers are separated only by a thin film of fluid.Pleural recesses occur where the lungs do not completely fill the pleural cavities so the two layers of parietal pleura come into contact, e.g. the costodiaphragmatic recess is present on each side where the diaphragm attaches to the costal margin.For the most part, the right and left layers of mediastinal pleura are separated by the mediastinal contents, but posteriorly the two layers temporarily come together behind the oesophagus as the mesoesophagus.The parietal pleura is sensitive to pain and touch.The visceral pleura has autonomic innervation (mainly vasomotor), but is insensitive to pain or touch.Pleura SummaryThere are two layers of pleura &#8594; parietal pleura and visceral pleuraThe visceral pleura is the inside membrane, and it&#8217;s insensitive to pain. It originates from the mediastinal pleura.The parietal pleura is the outside membrane, and it&#8217;s sensitive to pain.It is described similarly to the surface of the lungs &#8594; there&#8217;s a diaphragmatic, mediastinal, and costal parietal pleura.There&#8217;s also a cervical pleura, also known as a cupolaThe pleural cavity is the space between the inner visceral pleura and the outer parietal pleura.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/25/pleura-lungs-anatomy-lab.html"},
	{"title": "Control of Breathing", "text": "A summary of how breathing is regulated chemically and neurologically. These regulatory systems aim to keep the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide close to around 40 mmHg.Basics of Respiratory ControlWhen you hold your breath for as long as possible, eventually you can&#8217;t &#8216;hold it&#8217; anymore, and you have to breathe.What drives this response?Both the rate and depth of breathing are regulated so that \( P_ACO_2 \) (which is equal to the \( P_aCO_2 \)) is maintained close to 40 mmHg.So it&#8217;s the \( P_ACO_2 \) which largely determines regulation, not the oxygen! (which is somewhat counterintuitive)Why is this the case? Because it&#8217;s the \( P_ACO_2 \) that largely determines the pH of our blood!Most of the enzymes and proteins in our body perform optimally at a normal pH of around 7.4, so any change in pH is detrimental to their function.When \( P_ACO_2 \) is regulated, the \( P_AO_2 \) is automatically set to an appropriate value (via alveolar gas equation), depending of course on the ambient partial pressure of oxygen.A continuous, spontaneous cycle of inspiration and expiration is automatically generated by groups of neurons located within the brainstem.A \( P_aCO_2 \) sensitive mechanism is the main controller and is responsible for the breath-by-breath regulation of \( P_ACO_2 \) and hence \( P_AO_2 \).However, the \( P_aCO_2 \) controller can be overridden by a \( P_aO_2 \) sensitive mechanism when arterial hypoxemia occurs.	Take Home Point	\( P_ACO_2 \) is what is heavily regulated, and is maintained around 40 mmHg.Components of the Respiratory Control SystemThe system is fairly straightfoward, in that we have a canonical feedback loop driven by a central controller.We&#8217;ll be looking at each component of this, namely the:Central Controller &#8594; Pons, medulla, other parts of the brain.Effectors &#8594; Respiratory muscles.Sensors &#8594; Chemoreceptors, lung receptors, etc.The Central Controller1. The BrainstemThe brainstem has neural circuits that mediate the autonomic process of breathing.These result in our endogenous breathing rate, without cortical regulation.This includes neurons in the Pons and the Medulla.In the Medulla, we have a dorsal respiratory group (DRG), and a ventral respiratory group (VRG). (not too important)2. The Cerebral CortexWe also need a cortical override to this autonomous regulation &#8594; a way to voluntarily regulate the respiratory rate is necessary given differing environmental conditions.For example, during speech, or when you&#8217;re holding your breath because of a bad smell.However, as we all know, this is time limited &#8594; eventually, your body&#8217;s needs will take over, and the involuntary system will win.Summary of Central ControllersAutonomic RegulationBreathing is autonomically regulated in the brainstem, at the pons and the medulla.Somatic RegulationBreathing can be voluntarily controlled to a certain extent in the cerebral cortex.This is time-limited &#8594; eventually the involuntary system will win.EffectorsThe effectors are the muscles of inspiration and the muscles of expiration.As we saw previously:The diaphragm is mostly responsible for the process of inspiration, but no effect on expiration.Expiration is generally a passive process.When you actively expire, then the key muscles involved are your abdominal muscles, and to a lesser extent, your intercostals.Impaired InspirationIf you have a paralyzed hemidiaphragm for instance, you have impaired inspiration, but normal expiration.So they can still cough, and can still clear airways, but can&#8217;t inspire normally.Impaired ExpirationIn patients that are quadraplegic, with a C5 cord injury, they have an intact phrenic (C3, C4, C5), so their diaphragm is fine.However, they can&#8217;t cough, because they lose innervation to their abdominal muscles, so they can&#8217;t actively exhale.Hence, their inspiration is okay, but they can&#8217;t actively expire.SensorsChemical Control of Breathing1. Central ChemoreceptorsIn the medulla (ventrolateral surface of the medulla).The stimulus, as we described before, is a rise in \( P_ACO_2 \).But what the central chemoreceptor detects is a fall in pH, via a rise in [H+].If CO2 starts to rise, it can easily diffuse across the blood brain barrier into the CSF, increasing the CSF PCO2.Since there are few protein buffers in the CSF, a small change in the CO2 can cause a large change in the pH.In other words, the CSF is more sensitive than the arterial blood with respect to changes in pH. More formally:$$\frac{\Delta \text{CSF pH}}{\Delta P_aCO_2} >> \frac{\Delta \text{arterial pH}}{\Delta P_ACO_2}$$This change in pH is what the central chemoreceptor senses, triggering a compensatory increase in ventilation.This regulation occurs on a minute-to-minute basis, and is the major factor that regulates ventilation.2. Peripheral ChemoreceptorsCentral chemoreceptors are the key determinant in regulating ventilation, and they only involve CO2.However, as your PO2 starts to fall, it has an inhibitory effect on ventilation because of a sedative effect, which actually reduces the respiratory rate.This means that we need a way to protect PO2 delivery to the brain &#8594; hypoxia to the brain is more critical than for other organs.This protection is mediated by our peripheral chemoreceptors.The major peripheral chemoreceptors are in the carotid body, right at the &#8216;crotch&#8217; where the common carotid bifurcates into the external carotid and the internal carotid.There are also peripheral chemoreceptors in the aortic body, along the aortic arch.The carotid body is an organ which is a small collection of cells that is very sensitive to changes in PO2.Hence, it&#8217;s location makes sense! It&#8217;s located in the main artery that perfuses the brain, and senses any small fall in the PO2 feeding the brain.This sends a signal to the central controller telling it to increase ventilationThis is a minor regulator of ventilation, with a few exceptions:HypercarbiaAcidosisSummary of ChemoreceptorsCentral chemoreceptors are located in the medulla, and they detect changes in pH. They regulate respiration on a minute-to-minute basis.Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the carotid body, and they detect changes in PO2. They are a minor factor in ventilatory control.Mechanical Control of BreathingThese consist of &#8216;other receptors&#8217; that are typically not important in general health, but play a role in different pathologies.1. Irritant ReceptorsLocated in the airways, between epithelial cells.Stimulated by a variety of things, such as cold air, or mucous secretion.They affect cough, and trigger bronchoconstriction, but also drive ventilationIn patients with triggered irritant receptors, they&#8217;ll feel an urge to cough, and an elevated ventilation.2. Pulmonary Stretch ReceptorsNot at all important in normal ventilation.But in patients working with very large lung volumes, these stretch receptors are activated and actually inhibit the drive to ventilation.This is known as the Hering-Breuer Reflex.This makes sense &#8594; too much volume in the lungs means you would physiologically want to reduce the amount of air going in.3. Juxta-capillary (&#8217;J&#8217;) ReceptorsLocated in the Walls of the alveoli.In say left heart failure, with pulmonary hypertension, we have engorgement of the vessels, stimulating J-receptor activation, causing rapid shallow breathing.This causes the sensation of dyspnea before the actual onset of pulmonary edema.4. Bronchial (&#8217;C&#8217;) ReceptorsReflex tachypneaTracheobronchial secretionsReflex bronchoconstrictionBronchomotor toneThe Integrated Response of the Respiratory Control SystemVentilatory Response to HypercapneaVentilation with respect to PACO2, and in response to differing pH.Hypercapnea = Hypercarbia = too much CO2.In the left-hand panel, we can fix the PO2, and alter the PCO2 by giving more CO2 to breathe.Note that we have a linear relationship between ventilation and PCO2 levels!The slope of this line is used to define the drive to ventilation &#8594; \( \Delta \dot{V}_E/{\Delta P_ACO_2}\).Note that as we change the PO2, (by changing the PIO2), we can actually change the slope of this line &#8594; we change this drive to ventilation.As you become more and more hypoxic, the drive to ventilation increases &#8594; this makes sense!In the right-hand panel, we see that alveolar ventilation increases with acidosis, and decreases with alkalosis.Again, this makes sense:If you&#8217;re acidotic, you want to get rid of CO2 to reduce the pH, so ventilation will increase.If you&#8217;re alkalotic, you want to reduce CO2 loss to increase the pH, so ventilation will decrease.The Ventilatory Response to HypercapneaThese all make sense:Ventilation increases with increased PCO2Ventilation increases with decreased PO2Ventilation increases with acidosis, and decreases with alkalosisVentilatory Response to HypoxemiaVentilation with respect to PAO2, and arterial oxygen. Recall that the arterial and alveolar partial pressures are not the same for oxygen!The left-hand panel shows ventilation with respect to alveolar PO2.Compared to with PCO2, we see that there isn&#8217;t a significant drive to ventilation until the PO2 falls below around 60 mmHg, when the peripheral chemoreceptors activate.Hence this a non-linear relationship.Why 60 mmHg?The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is steep around 60 mmHg.This means that small changes in PO2 will cause significant changes in oxygen binding, and consequently, oxygen saturation.Note that this hypoxic drive to ventilation is augmented with an increase in alveolar PCO2.Again, this makes sense &#8594; we&#8217;d want to increase ventilation for two reasons here!Note that when we look at the arterial oxygen saturation, we have a linear relationship between the arterial oxygen saturation and the ventilation.This is because of the sigmoidal shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, which is a function of oxygen saturation with respect to PO2.It just so happens that the non-linear relationship between PO2 and ventilation becomes a linear relationship between arterial oxygen saturation and ventilation!Physiologically, this makes a lot of sense, because oxygen saturation (the percent of total hemoglobin sites bound) is ultimately the key determinant of function!Arterial oxygen saturation = \( S_aO_2 \)Clinical CasesCase #1A man hyperventilates and reduces his PaCO2 to a very low level prior to a deep dive, in order to reduce his drive to breathe. What is the problem that can occur?The idea here is to &#8216;defer&#8217; the drive to ventilation by hyperventilating beforehand.This lowers the PaCO2, reducing the hypercapnic drive.When you dive, and you&#8217;re holding your breath, your PCO2 begins to rise, and your PO2 starts to fall, because we don&#8217;t have ventilation.This gradually increases the ventilatory drive, which competes with your voluntary control at the cerebral cortex.The system has actually been designed so your drive to ventilation overcomes your voluntary control before your PO2 falls to dangerous levels and you faint.This prevents you from fainting from holding your breath!This can be seen in the figure below:Without prior hyperventilation, the PCO2 level reaches a point where you have an urgent need to breathe, before the PO2 reaches a point where we blackout.The problem is that when you dive, for every ~33 feet that you dive, you increase the pressure by about 1 atm.Hence, at 33 feet in, the ambient pressure would be at about 2 atm, causing the lungs to be half their normal size. Thus, all the partial pressures have doubled. (Recall the combined gas law from high school)The consequences is that you don&#8217;t unload CO2 from the blood as well, because we have a reduced CO2 gradient between the blood and the alveolus (there&#8217;s increased partial pressures in the alveolus).As a consequence, the arterial CO2 levels rise (recall that \( P_ACO_2 = P_aCO_2 \))When you rise to the surface, your lungs, which were half their normal size, now return to their normal size.If your PO2 was say 60 mmHg at depth, it would drop to 30 mmHg at sea-level. This drop in PO2 could cause you to faint.This increased risk of becoming hypoxic when you rise, makes it riskier to lower the threshold for the drive to ventilation via the CO2 response.The consequences of this can be seen in the figure below:Case #2Would the hypoxic ventilatory response be important for a sea level dweller on a climb to altitude?This causes a change in the barometric pressure (but not the fractional composition of oxygen).This then reduces the \( P_AO_2 \), which was, as given by the alveolar gas equation:$$ P_AO_2 = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}$$Hence we have obvious hypoxia here, which would be sensed by peripheral chemoreceptors, increasing ventilation.But why don&#8217;t we just use our central chemoreceptors, that detect changes in pH due to increased PCO2?When you&#8217;re chronically hypoxemic, you&#8217;ll be chronically hyperventilating to increase PO2, but this simultaneously decreases PCO2.As a consequence, the PCO2 will be very low.But then if this was the case, the central chemoreceptors would basically be doing nothing, because they&#8217;re sensitive to PCO2 levels.Here the peripheral chemoreceptors must be the dominant factor, because it&#8217;s the backup system in cases where the PCO2 is low but there is critical hypoxemia.Hence, the hypoxic ventilatory response is critical in maintaining hyperventilation at altitute!In normal situations, the central chemoreceptors are the most important factor regulating ventilation, but in a situation like this where there&#8217;s hypoxemia but low PCO2 levels, the peripheral chemoreceptors take over.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/25/breathing-control.html"},
	{"title": "Lung Volumes &amp; Ventilation", "text": "A summary of the different volumes and capacities of the lung, as well as equations for the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide at the alveoli.Lecture OutlineLung Volumes and CapacitiesClinical Measurement of Lung VolumesAlveolar and Dead Space VentilationAlveolar Ventilation and CO2Alveolar Ventilation and O2Lung Volumes and CapacitiesThere are four subdivisions of lung volume:tidal volume (VT or VT)inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)expiratory reserve volume (ERV)residual volume (RV)These four volumes can be combined to form four capacities (two or more lung volumes):total lung capacity (TLC)vital capacity (VC)inspiratory capacity (IC)functional residual capacity (FRC)The above image summarizes this well.Normally, when we breathe in and out, we inspire and expire our tidal volume (~500 mL).Of course, this volume varies between people of different age, sex, and weight.When we breathe in maximally, we not only inhale our tidal volume, but also our inspiratory reserve volume.Something similar happens when maximally exhale &#8594; we not only exhale our tidal volume, but also our expiratory reserve volume.The residual volume is the volume that is left in the lungs that cannot be expired.The presence of this volume of gas minimizes the fluctuations in the arterial blood gases with each breath and prevents the lung from collapsing at low volumes.When we refer to ventilation, we refer to the rate at which we move air in and out of the lungs.Hence, hyperventilation is increased air flow in and out, not an elevated breathing rate &#8594; that&#8217;s tachypnea!Summary of Lung Volumes &#38; CapacitiesLung VolumesTV = Tidal Volume = the volume of a normal breath.IRV = Inspiratory Reserve Volume = reserve volume that can be inhaled with maximal inspiration.ERV = Expiratory Reserve Volume = reserve volume that can be exhaled with maximal expiration.RV = Residual Volume = volume of gas in the lungs that cannot be exhaled.Lung CapacitiesTLC = Total Lung CapacityTV + IRV + ERV + RVThis is the total lung volume.IC = Inspiratory CapcityIRV + TVThis is the xaximum amount of air that can be inspired.FRC = Functional Residual CapacityERV + RVThis is the residual volume you have with normal breathing.In other words, the volume at the end of a normal tidal breath, where you are completely relaxed and not strained.VC = Vital CapacityTV + IRV + ERV = TLC - RVThis is the difference between the maximum lung volume and the physiological mininum lung volume (basically the total lung volume minus the residual volume that can&#8217;t be taken out)By definition, the minute ventilation is how much air goes in and out of our mouth per minute. This is obviously equal to our tidal volume times our respiratory rate.Although this is commonly measured because it&#8217;s so easy to measure, what we&#8217;re really interested in is alveolar minute ventilation &#8594; how much air goes in and out of our alveoli per minute.This is a better assessment of how well air is getting into our circulation!Clinical Measurement of Lung VolumesLung volumes that can be exhaled can be easily measured with a spirometer, for example tidal volume and vital capacity.A spirometer can only measure volumes that the subject can exhale &#8594; the residual volume cannot be assessed!Measurement of the residual volume or any lung capacity consisting of the residual volume can be done with the helium dilution technique.In the olden days, spirometers were based on the mechanical rise and fall of a gas container in water. Now, they&#8217;re all electronic!Alveolar and Dead Space VentilationNote that the main purpose of ventilation is to maintain an optimal composition of alveolar gas.The alveolar gas acts as a buffer (stabilizing) compartment of gas lying between the environment (ambient air) and the pulmonary capillary blood.O2 is continuously removed from the alveolar gas, and CO2 is continuously added to it by blood flowing through the alveolar wall capillary network.O2 is supplied to the alveolar gas, and CO2 is removed from it by the cyclic process of ventilation &#8594; the inspiration of fresh air followed by the expiration of alveolar gas.The cyclic nature of ventilation suggests the importance of the buffering effect of a large alveolar gas volume.Definitions1. Tidal Volume (VT)The amount of gas inspired or expired per breath.2. Total Minute Ventilation (VE)The volume inspired or expired per minute. Usually the expired ventilation is measured.This measurement is done by a volume recorder, such as a spirometer. $$\dot{V}_E = V_T \times f$$Where \(f\) is the number of breaths per minute.Recall that respiration only occurs in the last few branches of the tracheobronchial tree, in the acinus, past the terminal bronchiole.3. Anatomical Dead SpaceAlso known as VDan.A dead space volume, created by the conducting airways, in which no gas exchange occurs &#8594; this is about 2 mL/kg of ideal body weight.This is a component of the wasted ventilation, along with the alveolar dead space.4. Alveolar Minute VentilationAlso known as \(\dot{V}_A\)The volume of fresh air that enters the alveoli in each minute, to participate in gas exchange.Alveolar ventilation is always less than total ventilation; how much less depends on the size of the anatomical dead space and the tidal volume.5. Wasted VentilationWasted ventilation is also known as dead space ventilation, and is written as \(\dot{V}_D\)As air moves into and out of the lung, it traverses volumes that do not participate in gas exchange &#8594; dead space.The alveolar minute ventilation (the air that gets to the alveoli, and is involved with gas exchange), is the total minute ventilation minus the wasted ventilation &#8594; makes sense!In other words: $$\dot{V}_A = \dot{V}_E - \dot{V}_D$$The total dead space is also known as the physiologic dead space.Wasted or dead space ventilation consists of two components:Anatomical Dead Space (VDan)Wasted ventilation in the conducting airways themselves.For instance the non-conductive regions of the respiratory tract.Alveolar Dead Space (VDalv)Wasted ventilation in alveoli overventilated with respect to blood flow.That is, the air is at the alveoli, but it&#8217;s not involved with respiration because the air to blood-flow ratio is too high.In normal lungs this is typically minimal.The lung has both ventilation and perfusion occurring at the same time.In a perfect world, perfusion and ventilation will be perfectly matched.When there is imperfect matching, we have excess perfusion in poorly ventilated areas, or poor perfusion in highly ventilated areas. The latter leads to alveolar dead space.Hence, the alveolar minute ventilation, \(\dot{V}_A\), is equal to the breathing rate times the non-dead volume. In other words: $$\dot{V}_A = f \times \big( V_T - V_{Dan} - V_{Dalv} \big)$$Which is equivalent to: $$\dot{V}_A = f \times \big( V_T - V_D \big)$$For example, say \( V_T = 500 \text{ mL}\), and the respiratory rate is 12/min.Then our minute ventilation is \( \dot{V}_{E} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \text{ mL/min} \).However, say we have 150 mL of dead space.Then our alveolar ventilation is only equal to \( \dot{V}_A = 12 \times (500 - 150) = 4200 \text{ mL/min}\), since the volume in the dead space doesn&#8217;t get to the alveoli.In patients with lung disease, the alveolar dead space increases, causing an increase in the physiological dead space. (\(V_D = V_{Dan} + V_{Dalv}\))When your dead space increases, but the tidal volume remains the same, we have to increase our respiratory rate to maintain our alveolar ventilation.Below, we have an alveolus with no perfusion, so there&#8217;s no CO2 entering the alveolus from the pulmonary blood. This is effectively dead space, as described before.Hence, compared to your anatomical dead space, which is a fixed quantity, alveolar dead space can vary due to pathology.This physiological dead space can be expressed as a fraction between the total dead space and the tidal volume. It can be calculated in the laboratory with the following equation: $$\frac{V_D}{V_T} = \frac{P_ACO_2 - P_ECO_2}{P_ACO_2}$$Where \(P_ACO_2\) is the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and \(P_ECO_2\) is the expired partial pressure of carbon dioxide.This makes sense intuitively &#8594; the lower the CO2 content in the expired air, the more dead space there was to dilute it.Hence, the equation above determines the amount of CO2 dilution.Since the body needs to eliminate a certain amount of carbon dioxide per minute, the effect of an increased VD/VT is to require more total ventilation to maintain a stable PACO2.This makes sense &#8594; if there&#8217;s more dead space with respect to the tidal volume, more air must be ventilated due to loss in that dead area. In a healthy person, VD/VT ~ 0.30, (150/500 mL).The &#39;perfect&#39; lung with the idea alveolar compartment for the diffusion of gases to occur. Here, there is no dead space!This is the three compartment model of lung gas exchange, where dead space ventilation and dead space perfusion is considered.Question 1A healthy person inhales from the atmosphere but exhales into a collection bag for 3 minutes. The \(P_ECO_2\) of 28 mmHg is measured from the gas within the bag. An arterial blood gas drawn at the same time reveals a \(P_aCO_2\) of 40 mmHg.Calculate the physiological dead space &#8594; assume that \(P_aCO_2 \approx P_ACO_2\).Is the \(V_D/V_T\) normal?We can always assume that \(P_aCO_2 \approx P_ACO_2\), because there&#8217;s no A&#8594;a gradient in the CO2.The partial pressure in the alveolus is virtually identical to that in the arterial blood!$$\begin{align}	\frac{V_D}{V_T} &amp; = \bigg( \frac{P_ACO_2 - P_ECO_2}{P_ACO_2} \bigg) \\	&amp; = \bigg( \frac{40 \text{ mmHg} - 28 \text{ mmHg}}{40 \text{ mmHg}} \bigg)\\	&amp; = 12/40\\	&amp; = 3/10 = 0.3\end{align}$$This means that 30% of the tidal volume is actually composed of dead space.We mentioned before that a normal value for VD/V is 0.3, so our obtained value of 0.3 is normal.Question 2A patient with a large blood clot to the right pulmonary artery (pulmonary embolus) performs the same test. The \(P_ECO_2\) = 16 mmHg while the \(P_ACO_2\) = 40 mmHg. Calculate the physiologic dead space. Is this normal?Here the physiologic dead space = VD/VT is equal to (40 - 16)/40.This is 0.6, which is much higher than the normal physiologic dead space.This is due to reduced perfusion because of the embolism, with normal ventilation &#8594; alveolar dead space.The total dead space increases because of an increase in alveolar dead space.Alveolar Ventilation and CO2The alveolar ventilation equationThe partial pressure of CO2 in alveolar gas (PACO2) is determined by:CO2 added by the pulmonary blood (\( \dot{V}_{CO_2} \))CO2 removed by alveolar ventilation (\( \dot{V}_{A} \))CO2 added from the atmosphere. This is negligible compared to the other two components.This makes intuitive sense. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli is determined by the rate in (from the pulmonary blood) minus the rate out (from the alveolar ventilation). From this it&#8217;s obvious that:The faster the carbon dioxide enters the alveoli from the pulmonary circulation, the higher the PACO2.The faster the carbon dioxide leaves the alveoli via alveolar ventilation, the lower the PACO2.This can be expressed as a proportionality:The Alveolar Ventilation Equation$$ P_ACO_2 \propto \frac{\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{\dot{V}_A}$$This is known as the alveolar ventilation equation. (It&#8217;s not an equation though&#8230;)Note that VE is not in this equation (VT &#215; RR), so this ignores dead space!In the diagram below, we can see that at a normal \( \dot{V}_{CO_2} = 200 \text{mL}^{STPD}\) per minute, a \( \dot{V}_A = 4.2 \text{ L}^{BTPS}\) per minute is required to produce a normal PACO2 of around 40 mmHg.Question 3If the alveolar ventilation is only half of what is normally required for the body&#8217;s CO2 output, what will the PACO2 be? Assume that \( \dot{V}_{CO_2} \) remains unchanged.Using the previous relation, we know that if the alveolar ventilation is halved, then the carbon dioxide leaving the alveoli would be halved.As a result, the PACO2 &#8594; the alveolar partial pressure of CO2, would be doubled, if all else remains equal.Using this equation is somewhat difficult in practice since determining \(\dot{V}_A\) is difficult clinically.We can however re-express the equation, noting that \( \dot{V}_A = RR \times (V_T - V_D)\):$$ P_ACO_2 \propto \frac{\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{RR \times (V_T - V_D)}$$Assuming that all other factors are constant, if we see a patient with hypoventilation &#8594; elevated \( P_ACO_2 \), it can only be one of three things:RR &#8595;VT &#8595;VD &#8593;These arise naturally from the fact that the denominator must get smaller for the value of the equation to increase, assuming that the numerator (\( \dot{V}_{CO_2} \)) stays constant.Hyperventilation &#38; HypoventilationHyperventilation and hypoventilation are defined by changes in their alveolar ventilationHyperventilation: &#8594; \( P_ACO_2 \) &#8595;. If you ventilate more, then the carbon dioxide leaves the alveolus faster, dropping the partial CO2 pressure there.Hypoventilation:&#8594; \( P_ACO_2 \) &#8593;. If you ventilate less, then the carbon dioxide leaves the alveolus slower, increasing the partial CO2 pressure there.Note that this does not always correspond to an increase or decrease in respiratory rate &#8594; a change in ventilation could also be due to a change in tidal volume or dead space.NoteHypoxemia = Low \(P_aO_2\).Hypercapnia/Hypercarbia = High \( P_aCO_2\).Hypoventilation = High \(P_ACO_2\).Hyperventilation = Low \(P_ACO_2\).Alveolar Ventilation and O2The alveolar gas equationThe O2 in the alveolar gas is determined by:O2 added by alveolar ventilation (\( P_IO_2 \text{ } \&amp; \text{ } \dot{V}_A\))O2 removed by alveolar ventilation (\( \dot{V}_A \))O2 removed by the pulmonary blood (\( \dot{V}_{O_2} \))In the alveolus, Dalton&#8217;s Law states that:$$ P_A = P_AN_2 + P_AH_2O + P_AO_2 + P_ACO_2 = P_{ATM}$$Since the nitrogen content is fixed, as it&#8217;s neither consumed or excreted by the body, we can ignore it as a fixed constant.Similarly, variations in water vapour are minimal &#8594; it changes only with respect to body temperature.As a result, variations in the partial pressure of oxygen are primarily affected by variations in the partial pressure of CO2.This makes sense &#8594; they&#8217;re the gases that fluctuate in volume most due to gas exchange.Since the sum of the alveolar partial pressures adds up to the total alveolar pressure, there&#8217;s an inverse relationship between PACO2 and PAO2 for the same alveolar pressure &#8594; if PACO2&#8595;, then PAO2&#8593;This gives us a simplification for the alveolar gas equation:The Alveolar Gas Equation$$ P_AO_2 = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}$$The 0.8 is the respiratory quotient, which is \(\dot{V}_{CO_2}/\dot{V}_{O_2}\) (200mL/250mL).This relates the alveolar oxygen partial pressure to the alveolar carbon dioxide partial pressure.NoteAs we mentioned before, the \(P_ACO_2 = P_aCO_2 \) alwaysHowever, this never applies for oxygen. That is, \( P_AO_2 \neq P_aO_2 \)This equation lets us estimate the PAO2 in specific circumstances, for example:Question 4At sea level, what is your mean PAO2, if your PaCO2 is 40 mmHg? Assume that PACO2 = PaCO2. Calculate PAO2 on top of Mt. Everest.Using the alveolar gas equation, we obtain that, from sea level:$$\begin{align}	P_AO_2 &amp; = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}\\	&amp; = (0.21 \times (760 - 47)) - \frac{40}{0.8}\\	&amp; = 150 - 50 \\	&amp; = 100 \text { mmHg}\end{align}$$Don&#8217;t forget to correct for air saturation by water by subtracting the 47 mmHg!From Mt. Everest, the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is:0.21 is from the 21% fractional component of the air that is oxygen. 253 mmHg is the barometric pressure at the top of Mt. Everest.$$\begin{align}	P_AO_2 &amp; = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}\\	&amp; = (0.21 \times (253 - 47)) - \frac{40}{0.8}\\	&amp; = 43 - 50 \\	&amp; = -7 \text { mmHg}\end{align}$$What? How can you have a negative partial pressure?What&#8217;s going on here?People can survive at those heights without supplemental oxygen, so this clearly doesn&#8217;t make sense.In this case, the respiratory rate increases to try to eliminate CO2, so this increases the partial pressure of oxygen!More formally, in response to the reduced inspired partial pressure of oxygen, we lower our \( P_ACO_2 \) to compensate, by ventilating faster.Hence our \( P_ACO_2 \) would not have remained the same, which is what we assumed.If we repeat the calculation, assuming a 5-fold increase in ventilation:$$\begin{align}	P_AO_2 &amp; = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}\\	&amp; = (0.21 \times (253 - 47)) - \frac{8}{0.8}\\	&amp; = 43 - 10 \\	&amp; = 33 \text { mmHg}\end{align}$$This is compatible with life.Obviously, you would need to be very fit to survive with such a low \( P_AO_2 \), and to ventilate that rapidly.Question 5At sea level, if the alveolar ventilation is only half of what is normally required for the body&#8217;s CO2 output, what will the \( P_AO_2 \) be?If the alveolar ventilation is halved, then the \( P_ACO_2 \) doubles, as we saw before.We don&#8217;t have the same linear relationship with \( P_AO_2 \).We would have to calculate it using the alveolar gas equation we had before, and it would depend on the PIO2.Ventilation Summary\( \dot{V}_{CO_2} \) is the rate of carbon dioxide loss from the body.\( \dot{V}_{O_2} \) is the rate of oxygen intake from the air.For the alveolar partial pressures of CO2 and O2: $$ P_ACO_2 \propto \frac{\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{\dot{V}_A}$$ $$ P_AO_2 = P_IO_2 - \frac{P_ACO_2}{0.8}$$Hyperventilation: &#8594; \( P_ACO_2 \) &#8595;Hypoventilation:&#8594; \( P_ACO_2 \) &#8593;Measuring PAO2 and PACO2At the end of expiration the exhaled gas will represent an alveolar sample, since the first gas that&#8217;s exhaled will be from the dead space.We can collect the gas from the end of expiration and sample it with a gas analyzer.BTPS = body temperature, ambient pressure, saturated with water vapour.Most gas analyzers give results in terms of &#8216;percent of dry gas&#8217;. So in order to calculate the partial pressure at BTPS, the fraction must first be multiplied by (PB - 47).This was because, as we said before, water vapor pressure must be taken into account, and at a temperature of 37 &#176;C, this pressure is 47 mmHg.For example, if a sample of alveolar gas contains:FCO2 = 0.056 &#8594; 5.6% CO2FO2 = 0.143 &#8594; 14.3% O2Then the partial pressures are:PACO2 = 0.056 &#215; (760 - 47) = 40 mmHg.PAO2 =.0.140 &#215; (760 - 47) = 100 mmHg.This calculation makes sense &#8594; to obtain the partial pressure, we multiply the fractional composition by the total pressure, corrected for saturation by H2O.These values, 40 mmHg, and 100 mmHg, are the expected alveolar gases at rest/sea-level, where PB = 760 mmHg.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/24/lung-volumes-ventilation.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Respiratory Physiology", "text": "An introduction to some basic concepts in respiratory physiology - functional anatomy, basic nomenclature, gas laws, definitions, and physiological variables at rest and under stress.Lecture OutlineBasic Structure &amp; FunctionOverview of the Respiratory System.Basic Functional Anatomy.Abbreviations and SymbolsBasic Gas LawsBasic Structure &amp; FunctionOverview of the Respiratory SystemRespiration = Gas exchange.Ventilation = The process of moving air in and out.Ventilation is very tightly regulated at the brain stem.The brain stem takes inputs from both chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors.Oxygen diffuses through capillary beds in the lungs, and is transported to the tissues.The below figure shows a broad overview of what will be covered this week with regards to respiratory physiology.Basic Functional AnatomyFor the lower airways, we are generally focused on the muscles involved in ventilation.The key muscle for inspiration is the diaphragm, but it has nothing to do with expiration.Expiration is usually a passive process.If you want to actively exhale, the key muscles involved are your abdominal muscles, and to a lesser extent, the intercostals.Muscles of the Lower AirwaysThe diaphragm is mostly responsible for the process of inspiration.Expiration is generally a passive process.When you actively expire, then the key muscles involved are your abdominal muscles, and to a lesser extent, your intercostals.The AirwaysThe largest airway is the trachea.This splits into the left and right main stem bronchi.These then branch into the upper and lower lobes on the left side, and the upper, middle and lower lobes on the right side.The functional goal of these is to gradually decrease the radius of the airways with successive branches, consequently increasing the surface area.Eventually we get down to the alveoli, where gas exchange happens.The branching of the bronchial tree always occurs similarly.Everyone has 23 generations of branch splitting.It&#8217;s only once you get to the last few generations where the bronchioles start to branch off into lobules with alveoli, where actual gas exchange occurs.Hence, all the effects on blood gases generally occur mainly at this terminal level where gas exchanges occurs.The definition of the gas exchange area is anything that is distal to the terminal bronchiole.The terminal bronchiole is thus the last conducting airway. Anything after that is called an acinus, and has some degree of gas exchange.For instance, immediately distal to the terminal bronchiole are respiratory bronchioles, which have some alveoli.By the time we get to the extreme periphery, it&#8217;s basically nothing but alveoli!Tracheobronchial tree branching. After the terminal bronchiole, there is some degree of respiration occuring, as shown by the presence of alveoli.Tracheobronchial Tree BranchingThere are 23 branch generations.Respiration occurs past the terminal bronchiole.Branching Generations        	Trachea    	Generation 0            	Main, lobar, and segmental bronchi    	Generations 1-4            	Small bronchi    	Generations 5-11            	Bronchioles    	Generations 12-16            	Respiratory Bronchioles    	Generations 17-19            	Alveolar Ducts    	Generations 20-22            	Alveolar Sacs    	Generation 23            	Alveoli    	~ 200-600 million in number, with a diameter of ~ 250 microns    As we said before, branching allows for the cross sectional area for gas-exchange to increase exponentially with each succesive branch.As can be seen on the right, the cross sectional area at the respiratory zone is really big!This improves the degree to which oxygen can be absorbed from the lungs (the more surface area, the larger the area for gas exchange).The CT Pulmonary Angiogram is one of the most common uses for a CT. It&#8217;s used to look at the pulmonary vasculature.Pulmonary Blood FlowThe lungs, like most other organs, have a dual circulation.The Pulmonary CirculationThis circulation is the one you immediately think of, with blood leaving from the RV, and arriving at the LA.This is responsible for gas exchange.The Bronchial CirculationThe bronchial circulation involves systemic vessels, so the arteries have oxygenated blood and the veins have deoxygenated blood.These bronchial arteries supply oxygen to the airways themselves, since they&#8217;re metabolically active tissues themselves!This is a very small volume circulation, and is relatively unimportant physiologically.Clinically however, it&#8217;s involved in a number of disease states.They can be removed without any real consequence &#8594; they play almost no physiologic role!In patients that cough up blood (hemoptysis), it&#8217;s almost always coming from the bronchial circulation.Pulmonary circulation bleeds are much rarer.Summary of Pulmonary Blood FlowThe Pulmonary Circulation is involved in gas exchange.The Bronchial Circulation is more minor, involves systemic vessels, and supply oxygen to the airways. Almost always the source of hemoptysis.Abbreviations &amp; SymbolsFirst SymbolsThe first symbol is usually a capital letter referring to the variable that&#8217;s being measured.P = PressureV = Volume (Gas)Q = Volume (Blood)C = ConcentrationF = Fractional ConcentrationS = SaturationSecond SymbolsThe second second symbol represents the site of measurement. Gas phase measurements are in capitals while blood phase measurements are lower caseA = Alveolar GasI = Inspired GasE = Expired GasT = Tidal GasD = Dead SpaceB = Barometrica = Aterial Bloodv = Mixed Venous Bloodc = Capillary Bloodc&#8217; = End-capillary BloodKey Acronyms for Gas VolumesBTPSGas volumes expressed at body temperature (37&#176;C), ambient pressure, and saturated with water vaporSTPDVolume of gas expressed at standard temperature (0&#176;C / 273&#176;K) and pressure (760 mmHg) and dry.If the variable is a timed measurement, for example expired ventilation in litres per minute, then a dot is placed over the symbol.For example, the corresponding abbreviation would be \(\dot{V}_E\)ExamplesTidal Volume = \( V_T \)Alveolar Ventilation in L/min = \( \dot{V}_A \)Barometric Pressure = \( P_B \)O2 Consumption in L/min = \( \dot{V}_{O_2} \)Basic Gas LawsThe partial pressure of a gas is where you take the fractional component of the gas, and multiply it by the barometric pressure:Pgas = Fgas &#215; PBConceptually, it&#8217;s the pressure that the gas would exert by itself in the same volume (when it is isolated from the mixture).For instance, if the inspired gas is 50% oxygen:$$\begin{align}	P_{gasB}&amp; = F_{gasB} \times P_B\\	&amp; = 0.5 \times 760 \text{ mmHg}\\	&amp; = 356.5 \text{ mmHg}\end{align}$$Recall from high school that the pressure exerted by each component in a gas mixture is independent of other gases in the mixture.Also, the total pressure of the mixture is equal to the sum of the separate pressures which each gas would exert if it occupied the whole volume alone.This was Dalton&#8217;s Law.Example Question 1Question 1On the top of Mount Everest, where the PB is 253 mmHg, what is the partial pressure of oxygen in the dry atmospheric air? Make the same caculation at sea level.At sea level, the \( F_{atm}O_2 \) is 21%.The barometric pressure at sea level is around 760 mmHg.Consequently, at sea level, the partial pressure of oxygen is:$$\begin{align}	P_{atm}O_2&amp; = F_{atm}O_2 \times P_B\\	&amp; = 0.21 \times 760 \text{ mmHg}\\	&amp; = 160 \text{ mmHg}\end{align}$$At the top of Mount Everest, fractional composition is still 21% for oxygen, but the barometric pressure drops! (we saw it was 253 mmHg)As a result, the partial pressure of oxygen is:$$\begin{align}	P_{atm}O_2&amp; = F_{atm}O_2 \times P_B\\	&amp; = 0.21 \times 253 \text{ mmHg}\\	&amp; = 53 \text{ mmHg}\end{align}$$This is a significant drop (53 mmHg vs 160 mmHg)This is a cause of hypoxemia at high altitudes.In real life, the upper respiratory tract humidifies the air before it enters the lungs.Previously, we were looking at the partial pressure of dry atmospheric air.However, when we warm and humidify the air in our upper respiratory tract, we add a partial pressure of water vapour.This means that we have to correct for this humidification when we perform our calculations.Example Question 2Question 2On the top of Mount Everest, where the PB is 253 mmHg, what is the partial pressure of oxygen in the inspired tracheal air (PIO2)? What is the PIO2 at sea level?$$\begin{align}	P_iO_2&amp; = F_{atm}O_2 \times \big( P_B - P_{H2O} \big) \\	&amp; = 0.21 \times \big( 760 - 47 \big) \\	&amp; = 150 \text{ mmHg}\end{align}$$Basically, we have to subtract the partial pressure of water when the air is saturated with water vapour (47 mmHg).This value of 150 mmHg will come up a lot later &#8594; this is where it arises from.150 mmHg only applies if you&#8217;re at sea level and you&#8217;re breathing room air.At the top of Mount Everest, the partial pressure of the inspired tracheal air is:$$\begin{align}	P_iO_2&amp; = F_{atm}O_2 \times \big( P_B - P_{H2O} \big) \\	&amp; = 0.21 \times \big( 253 - 47 \big) \\	&amp; = 43 \text{ mmHg}\end{align}$$Key ValuesThe fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 21% normally.760 mmHg is the barometric pressure at sea level.47 mmHg is the partial pressure of water vapour at body temperature at 1 atm.Henry&#8217;s LawWe use Henry&#8217;s Law when we&#8217;re dealing with gas in solution.Henry&#8217;s Law states that gases are carried in solution in the blood in proportion to the partial pressure.This basically means you can have a partial pressure of a gas inside a liquid, which is proportional to its atmospheric partial pressure.Formally, this can be intuitively expressed as:$$C_{gas} = K_{gas} \times P_{gas}$$C &#8594; gas content in the blood.K &#8594; solubility of the gas in the blood.P &#8594; partial pressure of the gas.Definitions and normal physiological values can be found from here.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/respirology/2014/02/24/intro-respiratory-physiology.html"},
