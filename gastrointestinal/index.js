	{"title": "Mock Clerkship", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary – Tracy      7 day Hx of bad nausea and vomiting.    4 month Hx of vomiting.    CT scan ordered.    Important ‘vomiting’ questions?          Blood (Hematemesis) in vomit?                   Yes, there was melena, looked like coffee grounds.                    Associated with any activities?                  Worse with eating, but nausea all the time.          4 month Hx of vomiting, so definitely not acute.                    Pregnancy test?                  Went to Emergency department many times before, took pregnancy tests at those times, all negative.                    What else gives morning vomiting aside from pregnancy?                  In teenagers, always think of increased intracranial pressure → look at the eyes for this!                      Additional Information      CT showed massive pancreatic growth.    A Whipple’s procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) was performed.    Biopsy showed a pancreatic tumour, namely a pancreatic pseudopapillary neoplasm.  Whipple’s Procedure  Removed distal stomach, gallbladder, distal pancreas, duodenum.  Side to side gastrojejunostomy.          The stomach gets attached to side of the jejunum.        End to side choledochojejunostomy.          The gallbladder gets attached to the side of the jejunum.        End to side pancreaticojejunosomy.          Pancreas remainder attached to the side of the jejunum.        Why do you have to take so much out?          Pancreas, duodenum, distal stomach, gallbladder.      The pancreas has no serosa → high risk of invasion.                  Generally, tumours in organs without serosa have a worse prognosis that those with serosa.                    Also, all these structures arise as buds from the foregut, so they’re all interconnected.                  The duodenum and pancreas are, in particular, closely interlinked.          Then you have to reattach what connects to the duodenum → the stomach, the bile ducts, the distal pancreas.                      Is there an issue with diabetes after losing part of the pancreas?          No, there’s a great deal of pancreatic reserve.        What about gastrin with a loss of the distal stomach?          Recall that gastrin is made in the distal stomach.      So we lose this!        What about cholecystokinin?          It’s released in the duodenum (along with secretin).      So there’s no trigger for the release of enzymes from acinar cells of the pancreas (trypsinogen, lipase, amylase).        Other absorption issues?          Iron and folate.      Remember that these were absorbed in the duodenum!        How were you immediately after surgery?          Sore, didn’t really get much better.      Still vomited, had diarrhea, didn’t know if it was due to radiation/chemotherapy, or if it was a consequence of the surgery.        Why would she have diarrhea?          Unabsorbed material because of reduced small bowel length.      This can result in an osmotic diarrhea.      Could also be because of the radiation/chemotherapy.      Could also be due to loss of vagal innervation along the GI tract.      Dumping → because of loss of the distal stomach.      Bacterial overgrowth.        If there’s diarrhea despite not eating, what does it mean?          This is a secretory diarrhea → she’s secreting more than she’s absorbing.      Somatostatin can be used to shut down secretions, and ameliorate the secretory diarrhea.        What was the blood coming from?          Probably from a Mallory-Weiss tear → a tear near the gastroesophageal junction due to chronic vomiting.        Additional Information      60 pound weight loss.    Poor appetite.    Diarrhea.    Vomiting all the time, affecting fluids and electrolytes.    Nutitionally awful → now always on TPN.    They suspected that all the bile and pancreatic juices were going up into the stomach and not down.          This was because she vomited a ton of bile and pancreatic juices out when she was scoped.        A long and somewhat futile series of surgeries was then attempted:          Tried an Ω-anastamosis → a rare surgery where you connect one loop of the jejunum to another loop (a jejunojejunostomy) to try and redirect juices downwards.                  Basically, we create another branch to a lower loop of the jejunum, to try and redirect juices down.                    This didn’t work well, so then they tried to dilate a region of the jejunum where the thought there was a constriction.                  They tried endoscopy and balloon dilation of the gastroenterostomy.          Again, this didn’t work too well.                    Then they tried taking out the Ω-anastamosis, and changed it to what’s called a Roux-en-Y anastamosis.                  The jejunum then ends up looking like a ‘y’.          You end up with:                          One branch from the stomach to a fork in the jejunum.              Another branch from the liver and gallbaldder to the fork.              This then continues to the rest of the bowel.                                That surgery actually helped a little bit → it reduced the vomiting and diarrhea somewhat!                    Case #2  Case Summary – Chase      Birth asphyxia, seizures at 12 hours old, in PCCU for two weeks.    Lived with birth mother until 3, and was then abandoned at the hospital.    Had cerebral palsy, seizure disorders, asthma, and gut issues (vomiting, very thin, poor weight gain).    Why is nutrition so important?          With poor nutrition, you’re unable to determine which problems are due to nutrition, and which problems are due to his other issues.        Why might be have such bad asthma?          Asthma is very common in patients with cerebral palsy.      Because he has a poor laryngeal toilet → swallowing involves 17 muscles coordinating with one another.      Problems with this can result in aspiration.      He also has reflux so when he lies down, he’s unable to clear it.        What 2 ways would his gut issues affect his seizures?          He’s throwing up → this affects drug delivery and metabolism.      Don’t know where medications will go.        What are the feeding options?          NG Tube → most miserable, but easy to set up.      G-tube → gastrostomy tube.      G-J tube → gastro-jejunostomy tube.      Nissen Fundoplication (to reduce reflux), G-tube.                  Because you effectively create a one-way valve at the gastroesophageal junction, you can’t vomit.          This can be bad sometimes → eg. when you drink too much and you puke to avoid alcohol intoxication.                    TPN → requires tremendous lifestyle changes.        Problems at 4 1/2      G-tube placed at 3 years, resulting in better growth.    Still vomiting all the time.    Still having asthma, aspiration pneumonia.    Adopted at 4 1/2.    Why do the developmentally challenged puke?          Your muscles are more spastic.      Your stomach has increased tone, more likely to vomit.      Normally, the brain (namely the cortex) inhibits the desire to vomit in normal humans.      In cerebral palsy, where there’s decreased cortical activity, there’s no inhibition, resulting in puking.      This is bad ebcause we’re always trying to fix the gut, but the actual issue is neural.      So all those enteric specific medications don’t work!        How did his mom feel about this explanation?          A little frustrating → when you consult neurologists, they blame the gut, and when you consult gastroenterologists, they blame the brain!        Additional Information      Still vomiting all the time.    Still having reucurrent aspiration pneumonia.    G-tube converted to G-J tube.              G-J used for feeding, G-tube used for venting.        Was well for a while, but continued to vomit.              However, he soon developed lots of abdominal pain.    An ultrasound, showed an intussusception.    Why didn’t chase get TPN at the time?          He received TPN in the hospital, and was quite happy on it.      However, it was perceived that it would be too big of a lifestyle change.      It was thought at the time that everyone needed to fully understand the ramifications of TPN.        Additional Information      They ended up removing the G-J tube because it was intussuscepting.    Instead, they performed a Nissen Fundoplication to protect the lungs and the G-tube feed.    They eventually decided to switch to TPN feeding from home.    What are problems with TPN?          Clots, infections, difficult scheduling.      Also, there’s a risk of the lines clotting off, forcing you to change access points.      In Chase’s case, the lines in his arms, neck, and upper body were all clotted off.      He ended up having to have a rather risky femoral line.                  This hasn’t clotted yet, but if it does, he has few options left.                      What’s the current philosophy of care?          Quality vs. quantity → try to maximize valuable experiences as opposed to his remaining time.      Chase is now almost 18, and is medically very complex. At this point, there’s less of an emphasis on interventions, and more of an emphasis on quality of life.      Case #3  Case Summary – Kenedi      7 years old, tested positive for an APC mutation (Adenomatous polyposis coli) → was referred for screening due a family history.    Father had Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Syndrome (FAP, ahaha).    Blood per rectum on occasion.    Had a strong family history on her Father’s side.          Almost everyone had FAP!      The mutation is clearly autosomal dominant.        What is Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Syndrome?          Rare, life-threatening disease.      Autosomal dominant inheritance.      Accounts for 1% of colorectal cancers.      Adenomas begin to develop in early adolecscence, and you can end up with up to 100-5000 colorectal adenomas.      These also involve the small bowel especially the ampulla.      Cancer risk increases with number of adneomas.      If untreated, there’s a 100% colorectal cancer risk!      Median life expectancy of 42 years.        Why is it autosomal dominant?          You have two alleles of the genes, which are tumour suprressors.      Recall the two-hit hypothesis → normally you need two mutations to cause a phenotypic change.      With the APC mutation, you already have one inactivated allele, so you only need one hit to have rampant adenoma growth.      The risk of one mutation is actually quite high, which is why FAP is so dangerous.        What treatment options are there?          NSAIDs can actually inhibit the growth of these adenomas.      In Kenedi’s case, Celebrex (celecoxib) was used to inhibit growth.      However, in her case, she already had polyps everywhere, so she had to have her colon resected.      She ended up having a colectomy ileoanal anastamosis.      She also ended up needing an ileostomy bag for 8 weeks until she fully recovered.        What’s it like not having a colon?          A lot more bowel movements per day.                  Even now, she goes to the bathroom 8-10 times a day!                    Another issue is that you have ‘fart nerves’ in your internal anal sphincter that sample whether the stuff in your colon is solid/air/liquid.                  Normally, this lets you know whether you can let it rip, or if you should hold it in.          If this region is resected, you can never know whether a fart is safe or not!          As a result, any operation requiring a complete colectomy leaves a small part of the sphincter un-resected.                      What detachments need to occur with a colectomy?          The ascending and descending colon have retroperitoneal attachments.      The transverse colon is attached to the greater omentum.      So you gotta clip these all off to perform a colectomy.        What’s the hardest part of the operation?          Taking out the colon is easy, but taking out the rectum is hard!      The rectum doesn’t have a serosa, which makes it difficult.        Why is it possible to stretch the terminal ileul to the anus for the anastamosis?          The small bowel is long and convoluted.      So there’s lot of redundancy in the small bowel mesentery.        What electrolyte issues occur after a colectomy?          The colon primarily functions to absorb water.      When we don’t have one, we end up with a lot more fluid in the bowel, which pulls out salt too!      The stuff that then comes out into the ileostomy bag basically has the osmolarity of normal saline.        What is the purpose of the ileocecal valve?          Prevents bacteria from moving back into the small intestine.      Now that her ileum is directly connected to the anus, there’s a higher risk of bacterial infection.      This is bad for things that are absorbed in the terminal ileum:                  (1) bile salts and (2) vitamin B12.                      Additional Information      Recovered well, on annual follow ups, there were a few benign polyps, but nothing significant.    At age 12, an endoscopy found a large ampulla of Vater showing signs of adenomatous growth.    What do you do now?          The Ampulla of Vater is in the duodenum, so a Whipple’s procedure, which resects the duodenum, would theoretically work.      But Kenedi already had her entire colon removed, so this is obviously a bad idea.      What was done instead was an endoscopic ampullectomy:                  An endoscope is stuck into the bile duct, and fulguration was performed.          Fulguration → basically frying the hell out of the tissue.          Once the duct was sufficiently fried, a stent was placed in the duct to prevent it from scarring down and closing.                      Additional Information      Since then, only a few minor benign polyps have been found.    September 2013 → Kenedi presented with no sensation in the right side of her body.    Her CBC showed an Hgb of 50, and an MCV of 55.    What does she have?          Low hemoglobin → anemia.      Low MCV → microcytic anemia.      Since she’s not from the Mediterranean (r/o Thalassemia), the most likely cause is Iron Deficiency Anemia.        Why was this worrisome?          Although it could have been due to heavy periods, they were worried that there may be GI bleeding leading to the anemia.                  For instance, they thought it could have been a cancer, or secondary GI bleeding due to the Celebrex (recall that NSAIDs carry a risk of ulcers and bleeding).                    But it actually turned out that her iron deficiency anemia was actually because she decided to become a vegetarian!                  That’s why it’s never a bad idea to take a good history :P!                    Case #4  Case Summary – Jeff      1985 → 19 years old, vomiting.    Vomiting → what are important questions to ask?          Same questions as before.      Since he’s 19, could be alcohol, drugs, etc.      His vomiting was after eating, and was followed with abdominal pain.                  This is the typical GI vomiting presentation.                    Other questions include:                  OPQRST for Pain.          Do you see old food in your vomit?                          Helps localize the obstruction.                                Time of the day when you vomit?                          We have a ‘nausea cycle’ → everyone feels a little nauseated in the morning, and then this sensation falls during the day.              That’s why anything that worsens your nausea will typically present as morning vomiting.                                Do you have a headache?                          Recall that if you have a headache and vomiting, you have to worry about increased intra-cranial pressure.                                Alcohol ingestion?                      Additional Information      Abdominal x-rays showed gastric retention.    Massive stomach, full of fluid.    Was placed on TPN to provide for his nutritional needs.    What does one do now?          This looks like an obstruction at the stomach.      Endoscopy was done to take a look at what was causing the obstruction.      Of course, you have to drain the stomach first → it’s actually dangerous to scope such a heavily distended stomach, because of the risk of rupture.        Endoscopy      Removed lots of fluid from the stomach.    Saw a completely obstructed duodenum just past the duodenal cap!    Diagnostic possibilities for an obstructed duodenum:          In general, there are 3 ways to obstruct a structure:                  Intra-Luminal → filling up the hole in the middle.                          Foreign body.              Worms.              Tumour → benign or malignant.                                Mural → compression from inside the wall, eg. scarring.                          Obstructing duodenal ulcer.              Crohn’s disease.                                Extra-mural → extrinsic compression outside the wall.                          Lymphoma.              Cancer of the pancreas.                                          Since we couldn’t get into the duodenum, it could have been any of these 3 causes.        So what’s our priority of diagnosis?          Obstructing Duodenal Ulcer.      Crohn’s Disease.        Tests for Diagnosis?          Empiric PPI Treatment for a DU                  Double dose IV Pantoprazole (PPI), while monitoring the pH.                    Biopsies                   Taken coincident with endoscopy, showed acute and chronic inflammation, but no cancer.                    Gastrin Levels                  Were normal, so likely no hyper-secretion of acids.                      Additional Information      There was no reponse to PPIs, so a duodenal ulcer was ruled out.    Since there was no foreign body or tumours, intra-luminal causes and extra-mural causes were ruled out.    Hence, the suspected diagnosis was Crohn’s Disease.    What to do now?          They were worried about giving Prednisone to treat the Crohn’s, because it can cause duodenal ulcers.      So they coupled the prednisone with a PPI to prevent acid buildup.                  Jeff was on IV Prednisone + IV Pantoprazole + PO Omeprazole + TPN.                      Additional Information      Jeff improved, but when the prednisone dosage was tapered, it didn’t work.    At this point, he opted for a gastrojejunostomy to bypass the obstructed duodenum.    What are complications of a Gastrojejunostomy?          Some complications include:                  No functional pylorus.          Duodenum is bypassed (although in this case, this is a good thing).          Pancreatic juices and bile don’t mix with food.          Pancreatic juices and bile can go into the stomach.                    In particular, if you eats anything rich in carbohydrates, you’ll end up with bloating, and a horrible dumping syndrome.                  The carb-rich food will get stuck in the small intestine, and all the enzymes will break it into a million pieces.          All these little pieces are osmotic, and this draws a ‘shit-load’ of water (pun intended) into the small-intestine.                      Additional Information      Had an obstructed pancreas and bile ducts from Crohn’s disease.    Ongoing pain, ongoing vomiting, needed TPN.    Attempted to improve symptoms with a Whipple’s procedure    Recall that this is a combination of:              Distal gastrectomy.        Hemi-pancreatectomy.        Duodenectomy.        Cholecystectomy.              Why a Whipple’s Procedure?          Jeff only had Crohn’s in his duodenum, everything else was okay.      So the idea is that, if the duodenum is completely resected, and the pancreas and bile ducts are reattached to the jejunum, then his symptoms would improve.        Additional Information      The attempt at a Whipple’s failed miserably.    His RUQ was as hard as concrete, and when he was opened up, there was a massive intra-operative bleed.              The surgeons actually had to pack his abdomen, wait 2 hours, and then peek inside to see if things were okay!              When they peeked inside, they saw that he had a bowel perforation.              Peritonitis.        Overwhelming sepsis.              As a result of the infection and all the complications, Jeff actually had to operated on 3 times a day for 21 days!!              They’d actually open him up, wash everything out, and close him back up – 3 times a day, every day.        Instead of opening and closing his abdominal cavity again and again, they actually put a zipper onto his abdomen.                      It was “like a pair of Levi’s©”.            At this point, he weighed 86 lbs (he’s 6 ft tall).                                What happened next?          Jeff recovered from the surgery, but no further attempts were made to improve his symptoms.      His Crohn’s disease is inactive, and isn’t spreading.      But because they failed to do the Whipple’s, he still has chronic pain, and chronic bile duct obstruction.                  The persistent obstruction is leading to an evolving cirrhosis.          Portal obstruction is also leading to varices at the anastamoses between the portal and sytemic drainages (eg. esophageal varices).                    At this point, the only treatment is palliative.                  An agreement was made between Jeff and Dr. Howard to prescribe 100 percocets a week → this has been steady for the past ~28 years.                      What can we do at this point?          When you can’t ‘medically’ help a patient anymore, you can still have a therapeutic doctor-patient relationship.      Although concepts like ‘belief, trust, patient advocacy, and support’ are always thrown out there like buzzwords, they really are incredibly important.      For Jeff, it’s important just to have someone who listens to him, trusts him, and supports him.      It particularly helps since Jeff has had issues with other medical services.                  For instance, he’s scared of going to the Emergency department, because he gets judged because of his attire, tattoos, motorcycle, and abrasive personality.          They all think that he’s ‘only there to get pain meds.’          There’s a constant sensation of being ‘put down’, or being misunderstood.

	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Pediatrics &ndash; Recurrent Abdominal Pain of Childhood", "text": "ObjectivesBy the end of the session students should be able to:  Describe the clinical features of chronic or recurrent abdominal pain that suggest a pathologic medical condition.  Describe the features and prognosis of Recurrent Abdominal Pain of Childhood.  List the major medical disorders that present with chronic or recurrent abdominal pain in childhood.  List the presenting gastrointestinal symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).  List the extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD.  State the prognosis for IBD diagnosed in childhood.  Describe the effect of IBD or other chronic disease on normal development in school age, adolescent and young adult patients.Case #1  Case Summary  10-year-old Kaitlyn comes to clinic with a 2 year history of abdominal pain that occurs intermittently. The pain is described as aching and when you ask her where it hurts, she places her entire hand over her umbilicus. It lasts approximately 1⁄2 an hour to one hour and then resolves. She says it “feels like someone is twisting me.” The episodes usually occur about three times a week but on occasion have been more frequent. The pain does not wake her at night, but she needs to sit down and stop what she is doing when the pain occurs. Nothing seems to make the pain any better or worse. The past medical history shows that she has a healthy diet and is otherwise well. Kaitlyn is growing well, has no behavioural concerns, and she is doing well in school.1. In broad terms what organs/systems must be considered in the assessment of recurrent abdominal pain such as this?  Umbilical/midline pain is more suggestive of a functional problem, so it’s more reassuring.  Consider the GI, GU, MSK, reproductive, respiratory, and neurological systems.2. Explain the difference between functional and organic abdominal pain.  Organic → there’s an underlying pathological cause.  Functional → there’s no underlying pathological cause.3. When gathering additional information in the history, what factors (“red flags”) would suggest a pathologic cause for the abdominal pain?  Location (midline, RUQ, etc).          Midline pain is more suggestive of a functional problem.        Failure to thrive.  Decreased appetite, weight loss.  Acute onset or other symptoms (such as a fever).  Pain so bad that it wakes them up at night.  Blood in the stool.  Timing → if associated with eating/defecation, it’s more likely to be organic.  If they had the problem since they were &lt;4 → children less than 4 are less likely to have functional problems.4. What features in this history suggest a non pathologic cause of the recurrent abdominal pain?  Midline pain.  The pain does not wake her up at night.  Her diet is healthy, and she’s growing well.  Pain occurs intermittently, and isn’t associated with eating/defecation.5. What diagnoses would you consider?  Functional Abdominal Pain → aka. Recurrent Abdominal Pain of Childhood.  Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  Constipation.  Abdominal Wall Pain.  Lactose Intolerance.  Inflammatory Bowel Disease.  Additional Information      HR = 70, RR = 20, BP = 105/70.    Temp: 37°C, Height: 137 cm, Weight: 32 kg.    Her abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds. There are no palpable masses. The rest of her genitourinary, neurological, and orthopaedic examinations are normal.6. What are the important features on physical examination?  Joint inflammation, rash, lymphadenopathy.  Any kind of organ enlargement.  Guarding.  Castell’s sign (for abdominal wall pain).7. What findings may suggest organic rather that functional disease?  See above.  Anything suggestive of an active process.8. Of children presenting with recurrent abdominal pain, how often is an underlying condition found?  Quite low → &lt;10%!9. Based on your findings on history and physical, what is your most likely diagnosis for Kaitlyn?  Functional Abdominal Pain → aka. Recurrent Abdominal Pain of Childhood.10. How is this disease defined? How common is it?  Functional Abdominal Pain → abdominal pain that cannot be explained by any visible or detectable abnormality, after a thorough physical examination and appropriate further testing if needed.  Almost 25% of pediatric patients complaining of GI pain have functional abdominal pain.11. What are the characteristic features of recurrent abdominal pain of childhood?  Well, growing child.  Midline, relapsing, non-radiating pain.  Minimal relation to visceral function (eating, passing gas, stooling, urinating).  Onset at 6-12 years.  Treatment: reassurance, coping strategies, active observation.12. Are any further investigations for Kaitlyn warranted?  No → don’t do any tests, and reassure parent that this is normal/healthy.  Should do test if there’s anything suspicious.          Eg. if she looks pale, CBC.      If she has an enlarged liver, liver enzymes.      13. Why do you think this is? How will you reassure her?  If you do tests, there’s an off chance you’ll have a false positive!  Reassure them that this isn’t a diagnosis where we “just don’t know what’s going on”.  Confirm that this is a common diagnosis, etc.14. What physician and patient factors might influence your ability to do this?  Parents may suspect that it may be a rare disease, and they will be especially worried if you don’t do any tests.  Their parents might worry about effects on their academic/social success.  Parents don’t like seeing their children in pain.  If the physician doesn’t know the patient as well, they may be less trusting of your judgements.  Anxiety in either the patient or the physician.15. What is your management strategy?  Reassure them that you know what you’re doing.  Present the diagnosis confidently, and explain to them your rationale for not pursuing additional tests.  Present a clear follow-up plan, and tell them to inform you if symptoms change.Case #2  Case Summary  Julia is a 10 year old girl who comes to your office with her father. She describes a three month history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss.1.. Based on this history, is Julia likely to have the same diagnosis as Kaitlyn? Why or why not?  No → this seems more acute, and she has weight loss and fatigue.  The latter two are particular worrisome because they suggest a failure to thrive.2.. What else do you want to know on history?  Is the stool bloody? Is there oil (steatorrhea).  When did this start?  What kind of pain do you feel? Does it radiate?  How often does this happen?  What’s the consistency of the stool?  Is it getting better or worse?  Previous travels.  Additional Information  The problem began gradually after Julia returned from summer camp. She first noticed a mid- abdominal pain that occurred about two hours after eating. This progressed from occasional pain after meals to avoiding eating because she knows she will have severe pain. The pain is described as a midline, cramping pain that starts in the middle and radiates to the right lower quadrant. She has four stools per day, and frequent night time stools. The stools are not particularly urgent and do not contain blood. She thinks she has lost 10 lbs.  Her only other problem has been ‘bad knees’ that swell up from time to time. She was an active soccer player but now doesn’t have the energy to play.3. What features suggest an underlying pathologic cause of Julia’s symptoms?  Abdominal pain, diarrhea.  Fatigue and weight loss.4. Describe an approach to the differential diagnosis?  Infection, inflammatorym, etc. VITAMIN C5. Would you consider other diagnoses if the symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain onset more acutely?  More suggestvie of an infectious cause.6. What is your most likely diagnosis? Why?  IBD –&gt; Crohn’s or UC.7. List the findings on physical exam that you might find that would be supportive of the most likely diagnosis.  Additional Information  Upon examination you find the following:      Temp: 37.0, Height: 136 cm, Weight: 23.5 kg.    HR: 80, RR: 18, BP: 120/75.    Julia appears to be a thin girl in no acute distress. Her heart has a regular rhythm with no murmurs. There are hyperactive bowel sounds and right lower quadrant tenderness and fullness. No masses or organomegaly are present. Perianal exam is normal. You observe warmth but no redness or swelling over her left knee. The rest of the exam is unremarkable.8. How do you know this is NOT recurrent abdominal pain of childhood?9. How would investigate Julia? What would you be looking for?  Lab Values  Lab work is as follows:                    Lab Test        Value        Normal Ranges                            LKC        8.9        4.0-10.0 × 109/L                    Hgb        112        120-150 g/L                    MCV        75        79.0-95.0 fL                    Plt        502        150-400 × 109/L                                                           ESR        22        0-10 mm/hr                    Total protein        58        64-81 g/L                    Albumin        31        40-53 g/L            10. How do you interpret this?11. Which tests assess Julia’s nutritional status?  Albumin, ferritin.  Folate, B12, zinc, etc.12. Patients with Crohn’s Disease are often anemic. How does this happen?13. What causes diarrhea in inflammatory bowel disease?14. How does growth failure occur in Crohn’s disease?15. Compare features of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease. Why is it important to differentiate between the two?  Involvement anywhere outside of the colon → Crohn’s.  Additional Information  Julia suddenly develops symptoms of increasing crampy abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting.16. What complication of Crohn’s are you now concerned about? What are some other enteric complications of Crohn’s?  Now she has vomiting/nausea.  So now you have to be worried about a bowel obstruction (perhaps due to the formation of strictures).17. What are other extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn’s Disease?  Abcesses, fistulas, ulcers.  Serious issues like bowel obstruction, toxic megacolon.18. Discuss the management strategy for Julia19. What is the prognosis?20. Describe the effect this disease is likely to have across Julia’s lifespan (i.e. school age, adolescence, early adulthood, long term relationships etc.). Give some suggestions as to what might be helpful at each stage. (pre-test question 4)Case #3  Case Summary  Sebastian is a 6 year old boy who presents to your family practice with his mother for an annual check up. Sebastian has had intermittent complaints of diarrhea for most of his life. The family laughs about the foul smell of his flatus. Sebastian has 3-4 bowel movements per day. Appetite is not as good as it was a year ago. His mother attributes this to attending school full-time as he does not always have time to eat lunch. On further questioning, she recalls Sebastian suffering from a “bad flu” one year ago, after which he’s fallen off his growth curve.  Sebastian has previously been well. He has had no hospitalizations or surgery. To date he has grown along the 25%ile for height and weight.  On examination you find the following:Height: 104 cm, Weight: 15.2 kg  The abdomen is slightly distended but not tender. There are no palpable masses. The rest of the general examination is normal.1. What do you conclude thus far?2. Does this affect your approach?3. Of the diagnostic possibilities outlined in Case 1, which would you consider in Sebastian’s case?  Celiac Disease.  IBD.  Lactose Intolerance → less likely, since this typically doesn’t cause weight loss.  CF.  Parasites (travel).4. How would you proceed?  TTG -&gt; tissue transglutaminase.  Can be falsely low in patients who are already on a gluten-free diet.  Can also be falsely low if they have IgA deficiency.  Amylase + lipase r/o pancreatitis.  Lab Values  You receive the following results:                    Lab Test        Value        Normal Ranges                            Hgb        105        115-155 g/L                    MCV        78        77.0-95.0 fL                    RDW        25%        11-15%                    WBC        6.0        5.5-15.5 × 109 cells/L                    Ferritin        5        7-140 µg/L            5. How do you interpret these findings?6. What might he also be deficient in and why?7. How is a definitive diagnosis made?8. How is this disorder treated?  Gluten-free diet.9. What is tissue transglutaminase?  IgA antibody, especially to tissues in GI… (see answers).10. What are some of the barriers to treatment?  People already on gluten free diet, will always have a negative result.  Is still important to do that biopsy, because a gluten-free diet is difficult to maintain.11. What benefits can be expected with treatment?12. Sebastian’s cousin has autism. Should he be on a gluten free diet as well?", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/25/small-group-pediatrics-recurrent-abdominal-pain-childhood.html"},

	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Liver Disease & Pancreas", "text": "Dr. Jamie Gregor.Notes  An approach to liver disease is something you’ll use for the rest of your life!  Whenever you’re given a liver patient, you’re usually going to be getting a set of liver enzymes, and liver function tests, which is the core of an evaluation.          Liver Enzymes                  AST → aspartate aminotransferase.          ALT → alanine transaminase.          ALP → alkaline phosphatase.          γGT → Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.                    Liver Function Tests                  INR → since most of the vitamin-K derived clotting factors origin.          Bilirubin →          Albumin →                       AST and ALT are hepatocellular liver enyzmes:          They look at the health of hepatocytes.        ALP and γGT are cholestatic liver enzymes:          These are signs of biliary stasis.        Portal Triad = bile duct + hepatic artery + portal vein.          These portal triads pass through sinusoids, and feeds to the hepatic vein.        Differential diagnoses can be systematically gone through using the VINDICATE acronym:          V → Vascular.      I → Infectious.      T → Traumatic/Physical.      A → Auto-immune.      M → Metabolic.      I → Iatrogenic (or drugs, toxins).      N → Neoplastic.      C → Congenital.        Case 1  An 18 year old male presents with a one week history of fatigue, RUQ abdominal discomfort and yellowing of his eyes. He denies pruritus, but has noticed darker urine colour. There is no history of previous blood transfusions, intravenous drug use or tattoos. He denies taking over the counter medication and is on no prescription medications. On examination he is visibly jaundiced. His vitals are normal. He has a tender liver edge but no signs of chronic liver disease.   The spleen was not palpable. Preliminary labwork reveals AST 1250 u/L, ALT 1400u/L, alkaline phosphatase 197 u/L, total bilirubin 90 umol/L, INR 1.0. Notes  If you have carotenosis, your skin will turn yellow, but your sclera will be normal.  If you have jaundice, your sclera will also be yellow!  Itching with cirrhosis is due to bile salts.  Darker urine because of conjugated bilirubin (what gets into kidneys).  No risk factors.  Cirrhosis = fibrosis of liver, lots of nodules of scar tissue.  This guy has liver function problems, but probably not long enough where there’s sign of damage.          No signs of chronic liver disease.      No palpable spleen, why is this important?                  Blood to splenic vein, joins to portal vein, to liver.          So if you have scar tissue on the liver, everything starts backflow, enlarged.                      Liver enzymes are huge, but liver function tests are pretty normal.          So this is hepatocellular.      And acute.      Chronic liver disease only has a number of DDx.      Acute liver disease is a big superset of Ddx. Only a subset will become chronic.      Hep A is the acute liver disease that doesn’t transition to chronic!        List possible diagnoses?          Vascular → Portal vein thrombosis, or maybe even hepatic artery thrombosis.                  Shock liver → ischemic liver? from motor vehicle accident, heart attack.                    Infection → Hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E).                  Hepatitis A → Fecal-oral.          Hepatitis B → blood borne, sexually transmitted.          Hepatitis C → same as Hepatitis B, just a bit more blood borne, less sexually transmitted.          Hepatitis D → has to occur with Hep B, parenteral.          Hepatitis E → same as Hep A.          So A &amp; E are the same, and BCD are sort of the same.          Also CMV, and EBV (mono).          These are the 7 we most commonly throw out there.                    Trauma/Physical → nothing suggestive in the Hx.      Autoimmune → Autoimmune hepatitis.                  Make sure you rule this out, because it’s treatable, and it can hurt your liver fast.                    Metabolic → 3 classic metabolic diseases:                  Wilson’s Disease (Copper).          Hemochromatosis (Iron).          α-1-antitrypsin deficiency.                    Iatrogenic → look at drugs and toxins.      Congenital → doesn’t match Hx.      Viral Hepatitis.Autoimmune HepatitisDrugs and toxinsShocked liverWilson’s DiseaseHemochromatosis (DOESN’T CAUSE ACUTE HEPATITIS)Alpha-1-antitrypsin ()Cholestasis	Liver enzymes jump before liver function tests jump, with 1st 24 hours of cholestasis, can look hepatocellular.

Hep B surface Ab = sign of immunity. Typically this if there’s a vaccine!	- HIV Ab = sign of infection.- Hep A → looking for the antibody, marker of immunity.	- Since there’s a vaccine (halfrix, twinrix)?	- If IgG, past infection.

Case 2  A 52 year old man comes to clinic with complaints of abdominal swelling which has been worsening for 3-4 months. His weight has also increased 10 kg. He has known hepatitis C cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy 2 years ago but really has not had any follow up. He had used IV drugs in his twenties. He works full time as a bank manager. His wife is present with him and comments on a noticeable “forgetfulness” over the past 4-6 months and he volunteers that this is affecting his ability to perform at his place of employment. He seems to be awake more at night.   On examination he looks thin and has scleral icterus. He is oriented to place and time. He has spider nevi on his chest. On abdominal examination he has a nodular liver edge with a span of 7 cm and moderate ascites. He has mild ankle edema with a normal JVP.   Scleral Icterus → jaundice, due to high bilirubin.  Small nodular liver.  Spider nevi due to portal vein backflow feeding into anastamoses with the systemic circulation.  Bleeding → due to low INR plus dilated veins.  Ascites → due to decreased oncotic pressure with low albumin, as well as increased interstitial pressure due to backflow.  Muscle wasting → catabolic state.  Forgetfullness? Encephalopathy.          Ammonia.      But not just that.      Liver not clearing things, leading to forgetfullness.      Probably affects GABA receptors.      What drug affects you by affecting GABA receptors                  Benzodiazepines!          NEVER GIVE BENZOS to patients with hepatic encephalopathy, you’ll have a double-whammy!                      Itching? Bile salts?      What are the clinical features that define “decompensated cirrhosis”        Outline a management strategy for hepatic encephalopathy:  1. NO SEDATIVES. Avoid sedatives (benzos).2. LESS AMMONIA. Avoid animal proteins. How does ammonia get made? Breakdown of amine groups in amino acids. Aromatic amino acids (like phenylalanine), especially made.3. CLEAR ALL THAT CRAP. Use laxatives.	- Lactulose is what's typically used.	- Sugar based laxative -&gt; tastes sweet, body can't break it down, don't have digestive enzyme.	- Bacteria splits it in half in colon, becomes osmotically active. ALSO MAKES IT ACIDIC!	- Produces an osmotic diarrhea, and is acidic, so it traps ammonia 4. NO INSULTS.	- No alcohol.	- Lower animal proteins (aromatic A.As).5. TREAT INFECTIONS.	- Worry about infection for patients with ascites.	- Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.		- In your belly, you got a huge pile of fluid, that's sitting right beside your gut.		- Little bacteria sneak through your gut lining and get to the fluid.		- Normally, there are white cells and stuff to fight it off.		- But ascitic fluid doesn't have much of this shit, great medium for infection.	- In patients with uncontrolled ascites or previous SBP, give them prophylactic Abx (1/week ciprofloxacin).  Outline a management strategy for ascites:          Lactulose.      Abx.      No alcohol, lower animal proteins.      Diuretics, abdominocentesis.      Some spironolactone, blocks aldosterone.      Also give you loop diurectic that’s potassium wasting, to counteract high potassium from spiron.      TIPS -&gt; redirect through liver because of fibrosis.                  Stenting.          Problem is that you might completely eliminate any filtration that happens, so you might end up with encephalopathy.                      What “routine” investigations are suggested in individuals with cirrhotic stage liver disease?          Think of the 4 main complications.                  Bleed.                          Make sure they’re not bleeding.                                Ascites.                          Make sure they don’t have ascites.                                Encephalopathy.                          Make sure they’re not confused.                                Hepatocellular Carcinoma.                          You have to have cirrhosis.              Ultrasound.              Scope less frequently.              Blood tests (alpha-fetal protein for tumour).                                            Case 3  A 35 year old female comes into emergency with a 6 hour history of severe epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back. She feels nauseated and vomited once. She has never had pain like this before. For several years, she has noticed some occasional RUQ abdominal pain when she eats fast food that lasts for 15-30 mins. She has not mentioned this to her family MD. She does not take any medications. She denies alcohol consumption recently. Abdominal X-rays are normal. Labwork reveals serum amylase is 1700 U/L (n&lt;125) and the lipase is 600 U/L (n&lt;35).   Why do you take the X-ray?          Dilated bowel of some kind.                  Due to ileus (paralyzed bowel) or obstruction.                    Perforation -&gt; FREE AIR. Air levels.      TYPICALLY LOOK FOR FREE AIR (PERFORATION) and DILATED BOWEL (OBSTRUCTION).      Not really useful for much else.        What is the likely diagnosis?          Acute pancreatitis → because of the elevated serum amylase and lipase.      NINETY PERCENT OF THESE ARE DUE TO:                  Gallstones, blocking at ampulla of Vader.          Alcohol.                    Kill acinar cells, trigger trypsinogen to trypsin CASCADE!                  Everything just goes crazy.                      What other tests would you do?          Done X-ray, lipase, amylase.      Since the 2 most common are stones and alcohol:      STONES                  Cholestatic -&gt; ALK, AGT.          Also AST and ALT (since they shoot up early, remember)          If any of these elevated, suspicious of gallstone.          Then, to Dx is U/S! Look for dilation of common bile duct, or other stones in gallbladder. Often it’s hard to see the stone itself with U/S because of air in the duodenum affecting image quality.                    ALCOHOL -&gt; she denies it, recall!      HYPERCALCEMIA and HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA (almost never positive) -&gt; can also cause acute pancreatitis.      CT also possible.Labs: CBC, electrolytes, urea, creatinine, glucose (pancreas produces insulin), INR, albumin, amylase, lipase• Serum triglycerides• Serum calcium• Liver enzymes and Abdominal ultrasound• Abdominal x-rays	– R/O ileus, perforation  Ultrasound shows gallstones in the gallbladder and they are suspected in bile duct and an edematous pancreas. Describe your initial approach to this patient.  No drug to get rid of acute pancreatitis.          Stop the cause + supportive Tx!      NPO, IV fluids, treat pain.        Two days later the patient is no better. The pain continues. The patient is febrile and the liver enzymes are climbing. The patient had no history of previous pancreatitis and there was no excess alcohol intake. What would be the next step?  Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography  Go up the common bile duct, and remove the stone.  We usually don’t jump in right away, because this is also a source of pancreatitis (5%)! ERCP!  So high risk, guaranteed that someone will die from your ERCP. So you better be sure they need it.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/23/small-group-liver-disease-pancreas.html"},

	{"title": "GI Bleeding", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesAt the completion of this lecture the student will be able to correctly:1. Define the meaning of the following terms: ‘hematemesis’, ‘melena’, ‘hematochezia’, ‘occult bleeding’, and ‘obscure bleeding’.2. Based on the location, describe 3 types of GI bleeding.3. List seven causes of upper GI bleeding and their relative likelihood in an undifferentiated case of upper GI bleeding.4. List nine causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.5. Of the nine causes of lower casReview of Terminology  Hematemesis          Vomiting of blood or cofee-ground like material.      Coffee-ground look is because it’s been digested by       Always an upper GI bleed → you can’t get blood coming up to the front from the distal small bowel or colon.        Melena          Black, tarry stools.      Caused by the degradation of blood by intestinal bacteria.      Usually upper GI bleeds, but some slow bleeds from the colon or small bowel can also cause this.        Hematochezia          Bright red, or marron-colored blood, or fresh clots per rectum.      Usually lower GI bleeds, or, if the bleed is fast enough, an upper GI bleed.        Occult bleeding          Bleeding that’s occurring but not seen.      Found via stool tests or blood tests (eg. if you’re anemic).        Obscure bleeding          Bleeding NYD even after normal upper endoscopy and colonoscopy.      May be overt or occult.      Classification of GI bleeding  By Location          Upper GI Bleeds → esophagus, stomach, duodenum.      Lower GI Bleeds → terminal ileum, colon.      Mid-small bowel → distal to the ligament of Treitz.        By Acuity          Acute      Chronic      Upper GI bleeding￼Case: A 65 year old man presents to the E.R. with a 24 hour history of coffee ground emesis, melena and lightheadedness. He was started on Ibuprofen 3 weeks ago for back pain. His HR is 110, BP 90 / 60 and looks pale. His hemoglobin is 80.Causes of UGI bleeding1. Peptic ulcer disease: Gasric ulcer, duodenal ulcer (55%) 2. Esophagitis	- Probably what this guy had.3. Portal hypertension: Esophageal / Gastric Varices4. Traumatic: Mallory-Weiss tear, Aorto-enteric fistula	- Aorto-enteric fistulas are often caused after AAA repair.The below are rare (LOOK THIS UP LATER)5.

Bleeding that starts in hospitalFindings on Endoscopy and Therapy:- Ulcers with active bleeding, visible vessel or clot are treated endoscopicallywith epinephrine injection, coagulation or hemoclips- Varices are treated with band ligation or sclerotherapy- Other vascular lesions are coagulatedRecurrent acute ulcer bleeding:- If the bleeding persists despite endoscopic treatment, surgery is usuallyneeded- If the bleeding stops and then restarts again, a second endoscopy can beattemptedBleeding ulcers￼￼Ulcer with visible vessel treated with hemoclips- RecurrentMore specific medical treatments:-  Ulcer bleed- Proton pump inhibitor once daily versus infusion- H. pylori eradicationconfirm eradication after treatment-  Variceal bleed- Octreotide- Proton pump inhibitor- Antibiotic- Beta-blocker (not acutely)Lower GI BleedingCase: An 80 year old female presents to the E.R. with a 2 day history of rectal bleeding. She denies abdominal pain. She takes Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. Her vitals are stable and Hb is 105, INR 3.0.Causes of LGI bleeding:1. Diverticulosis (40%)2. Angiodysplasia (25%)3. Hemorrhoids (common if &lt; 50 years)4. Colorectal cancer (10-20%, if &gt; 50 years) 5. Colitis: Ischemic, Infectious, Ulcerative￼￼￼6. Crohn’s disease7. Radiation proctitis8. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome 9.

Treat the patient first, ie. ABC’s, then investigate and treat the actual bleeding site. Many patients with intermittent bleeding that are stable (normal hemoglobin, vitals, and otherwise healthy, can often be worked up as an outpatient. Unstable patients, patients with evidence of active bleeding and those with multiple comorbidities need to be admitted to hospital for investigation and management.The approach to the work up of a patient presenting with hematocheziadepends on the stability of the patient: -  Stable: Colonoscopy-  Unstable: Consider upper endoscopy +/- angiography and surgical consultation- Tagged RBC scan:- Nuclear medicine scan using a radionuclide tagged onto RBC’s andabdominal imaging- Indicated when bleeding persists to help “localize” the bleeding area for theangiographer or surgeon- No therapeutic potential- Angiography:- Interventional radiology- Contrast injected selectively into the mesenteric arteries looking for extravasation into the GI tract- Therapy with embolization (Gelfoam, coil)- May prevent the need for surgery- Complications: Bowel infarction, arterial thrombosis and embolization, hematomaand contrast-induced renal failureCase: A 70 year old female presents to her family M.D. with fatigue. She also has noticed chest pressure and shortness of breath on exertion worsening for 3 weeks. Her PMHx is significant for colonic polyps 10 years ago. She looks pale. Vitals normal. Her CBC shows a Hb 68 with MCV 70 and ferritin low at 5.Causes of chronic LGI bleeding (often visible blood)1.Colonic polyps / malignancy 2.Angiodysplasia3.IBD4.Hemorrhoids5.Radiation proctitisColon PolypColon Cancer￼￼￼Causes:Small bowel bleeding￼1.

It is not possible to tell if this is benign or malignant from the picture.- Clinical Features    - Late presentation → it is usually not resectable at a late stage    - Jaundice rare    - Usually unresectable    - Poor prognosisAngiosarcoma- From endothelium of blood vessels- Rare- Elderly males- 40% have a known risk factor: vinyl chloride, arsenic, sex steroids, (Thorotrast)- Very poor prognosisSecondary Malignant Neoplasms (i.e. Liver Metastases)      1 site of hematogenous mets          This is due to the liver’s dual blood supply                  Portal venous blood travels through liver, thus it is the primary site of hematogenous mets for any tumour of GI tract          It also has a systemic blood supply → common sites of origin for these mets are lungs, breasts, and the GI tract (especially colorectal)          Despite a heavy tumour burden, liver function can remain surprisingly normal → one can get amazing amount of tumour without compromisinig function                      Some can be cured by resection (e.g. colorectal), but this really depends on the type of primary malignancyLiver Metastases. They are often visible from outside and are well circumscribed in nature. They may be umbilicated if there is central necrosis.These are emtastases from small cell carcinoma of the lung.  Focal Nodular Hyperplasia          Due to arterial malformation in one area of the liver → increased blood flow → local hyperplasia      Often an incidental finding                  Patient will complain of abdominal pain          Might suspect cholecystitis (inflammation of gall bladder), however, on ultrasound, a liver nodule will be visible                          Frequently, it is diagnosed just like this, through imaging              If you are quite sure that it is not focal nodular hyperplasia, you can image it again in 6 months to 1 year to see if it’s changed              If you are not sure what it is, biopsy it!                                          This looks like it could be a cirrhotic liver, but it’s actually focal nodular hyperplasia &amp;rarr; remember, cirrhosis is diffuse, not focal! Moreover, this is a biopsy of a mass lesion, not of the liver.Summary  The #1 benign tumour is a hemangioma  The #1 malignant tumour is from metastasis  The #1 primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/17/liver-masses.html"},

	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Diarrhea, IBD, IBS", "text": "  Case 1  A previously healthy 36 year old male gives a history of gradually worsening diarrhea over a six week span. Initially he simply had looser stools but in the last four weeks he has noticed red blood mixed in the stool and in the toilet water. He has a lot of urgency and has a constant sensation that he needs to go to the bathroom. He has had some mild lower abdominal cramps with his bowel motions. In the last two weeks he has averaged 8-10 loose bowel movements per day and has to get up at night to go. He has lost 5 kg in weight.Unintentional weight loss is basically a warning sign in any organ system!  List the ‘warning’ symptoms in the case:          Unintentional weight loss.      Blood in the stool.      Progressive.      Lasted longer than 4 weeks.                  This is typically the cutoff between acute diarrhea and chronic diarrhea.                    He has to get up at night to go.                  You might have had to wake up at night to pee, but I doubt you’ve ever had to wake up at night to poop!           Actually, when you go to sleep, your colon goes to sleep as well.           So that’s why you never have to wake up to defecate!          So the fact that this is happening is more suspicious.                      Is this more likely to be a colonic or small bowel problem?          Colonic →                   Recall that melena vs hematochezia.          Melena only good at differentiating between ligament of Treitz.          Melena is only good for the stomach and proximal duodenum.                    Colonic diseases tend to bleed more, while small bowel problems tend to hurt more.        Give a focused differential diagnosis:          Crohn’s      Ulcerative colitis      IBS      Infectious → since this is an chronic diarrhea, then… parasites, giardiasis.      Celiac’s Diseaes → especially if he’s Western European, Scandinavian.      Too young to really be cancerous.        How would you investigate this patient?          Blood Tests:                  CBC → Looking for signs of inflammation or anemia.          Inflammatory markers → CRP, ESR.          Albumin → Nutritional marker.                    CNS → don’t generally need to check it, because you don’t need to treat it.                  Because if you’re healthy, you wouldn’t treat it even if you found it!          Exceptions: Immunocompromised, very ill, pregnancy, miserable.          Listeria is really bad if you’re pregnant.          C.diff and diarrhea, you should also treat it.                    O&amp;P → Ova &amp; Parasites:                  What worms and parasites do you test for?          You actually only test for 3 → Giardia is one of them.          This isn’t very useful → if they have a worm, they’ll show it to you!          This is more useful if the patient has recently travelled.                      What is the first line treatment for the most likely diagnosis?          The most likely Dx is ulcerative colitis.      5-ASAs? For mild-moderate ulcerative colitis.      Prednisone? For moderate-severe cases.      Azothiaprin? Efficacy in Crohn’s and UC is rather poor, but grandfathered in.                  Probably works well for maintenance therapy, but not induction.                    Methotrexate doesn’t work for UC, but works for Crohn’s.      Aflixomab → $30,000 a year. Really expensive.                  Chimeric antibody.          Anti TNF, mops up your TNF.          IV infusion (right now there are no oral biologics).          Works well in severe UC and refractory UC.                    Atalinomab?! (Humera) → trial came out last year. Approved for UC.                  Response rate in placebo here was actually 8%!          Recall, usually 1/3 placebo response rate.          With humera, the response rate is 16%…          Not that great…          So few people use Atalinomab for UC treatment.                    Ciclosporin (Calcineurin Inhibitors)                  Recall, used for graft transplants.          Used for severe refractory UC to try and save the colon as well.                    Antibiotics not that useful for UC.        Case 2  A 25 year old woman presents to your office with a history dating back to her teenage years of abdominal pain. The pain is localized to both lower quadrants and is associated with diarrhea. She feels bloated most of time. The diarrhea consists of 4-5 loose stools daily. The abdominal discomfort is relieved temporarily after defecation. These episodes of pain and diarrhea occur about 2-3 times per week. Otherwise, her bowel pattern is normal. Her diet is pretty typical, although she does consume fast food frequently and has about 4-5 caffeinated beverages / day including coffees and diet coke. Labwork including CBC, albumin, CRP and Celiac serology are normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis and why?          Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)                  IBS → F &gt; M.          She’s young as well.          Blood tests are all normal.          Relieved with defecation.                    	&lt;span class=sidenote&gt;If you have bloating in the absence of other red flags, then it's most likely IBS. One other example would be lactose intolerance, which can be tested with empiric therapy (don't drink milk).&lt;/span&gt;	- &lt;i&gt;Bloating&lt;/i&gt; is classic with IBS.	- Intermittent onset of symptoms.- *Other possible diagnoses*:	- Microscopic colitis.	- Caffeine (caffeine causes diarrhea).	- Fast food often worsens symptoms because they're high in fat, which worsens symptoms in IBS.&gt; ####**The Rome III Criteria**&gt; - Recurrent abdo pain or discomfort, &amp;gt; 3 days/month &gt; in the last 3 months, associated with &amp;geq; 2 of:&gt; 	1. *Improvement w/ defecation*&gt; 	2. *Onset associated w/ change in frequency of stool.*&gt; 	3. *Onset associated w/ change in form (appearance) of stool.*&gt; - In other words, (1) consistency, (2) frequency, (3) improvement with defecation.  Discuss appropriate management of this patient          Reassurance → recall that there’s no treatment for IBS.      If patients are debilitated by their symptoms, then patients will generally be more upset.                  The best way to deal with these patients is to set realistic goals at the beginning.          Be clear with them that your diagnosis will not change, and that you’re not just labelling it IBS because you don’t know what it is.                    Stress reduction      Fibre → fibre is useful for everything!                   If the patient has diarrhea, then fibre helps solidify your poop by drawing water in.          If the patient has constipation, then take fibre, but also drink lots of water (otherwise your poop will turn to concrete).                    Medications → if they still have severe symptoms.                  Tricyclic antidepressants → small doses, make sure you warn them about the small risk of suicidal ideations!          She also has diarrhea, and tricyclics are anti-cholinergic, !?! Even better.          Don’t use opioids with IBS.                          It doesn’t work very well at controlling their pain.              Patients easily become dependent on them.              Bad side effects to your bowel motility.                                Codeine sucks. 15% of people don’t have the enzyme that can metabolize codeine to morphine, so they’re basically taking tylenol.          Atropine (anti-cholinergic).          Pro-biotics.          Wait, anti-motility agent LOPERAMIDE (opioid!?)                          Immodium!?                                            Case 3  A 21 year old male, previously healthy, presents to the Emergency Department complaining of the sudden onset of severe watery diarrhea in conjunction with lower abdominal cramping for 36 hours. Today, he began to notice moderate amounts of red blood in the toilet water in conjunction with bowel movements and states he had 20+ bowel movements. He denies foreign travel. He does report eating a hamburger in a fast food establishment 48 hours ago with a friend and has heard that his friend “isn’t feeling well”. On examination he appears unwell with normal colored but dry mucous membranes and has a resting tachycardia at 120/minute. His blood pressure was 120/70 recumbent but drops to 100/50 when measured with the patient sitting up. He has a temp of 38 degrees Celcius. He has some tenderness in the lower abdomen but not an acute abdomen.  What is the most likely diagnosis?          Criteria for severe postural vitals. Postural hypotension.      Or if already light headed when doing postural vitals (2-5 min).                  Drop in 20 in systolic.          Drop in 10 in diastolic.          Rise in 30 in HR.                    E. coli.      Since there’s blood in the stool, worry about EHEC.      4 types of E.coli infection:                  EHEC.          ETEC.          EIEC.          That last one with that Shiga toxin!?                    Why do we care about EHEC? Risk of HUS.                  EHEC toxin creates an aberrant immune response.          Risk of renal failure.          Hemolysis too, of course.                    36 hours duration, 12 hours since eating that burger.      If got sick 12 hours after eating, must be preformed toxins:  	- Staph aureus.                  Clostridium perfinges.                      Describe your approach to his management:          Hydration → something isotonic, Normal Saline, or Ringer’s Lactate.      C. diff, should you do CNS? Yes, you gotta do it because he’s sick.      Blood work → Electrolytes. BUN, Creatinine.      CBC → look for hemolysis, thrombocytopenia (if you’re )      Abdo x-ray → look for toxic megacolon.      Avoid anti-motility agents.      Rule out Abx until O157:H7 is ruled out. Then they’ll release all the toxin and make shit worse!        The patient recalls that he received some antibiotics 1 month ago for Strep throat. What additional test would you order now?          C. diff.      What if he didn’t have that past history, would you still order the C. diff test?      Might as well, especially if they’re older.        If this test were positive, would it change your management?          Metronidazole (Flagyl) → 500 mg POD BID for almost everything else, but 500 mg TID for C. diff!      Vancomycin → oral vanco only used for C. diff.                  Recall oral vanco isn’t absorbed, so mostly you use IV.          The only exception is C. diff.                      Case 4  A 35 year old female with type 1 Diabetes on insulin for 20 years develops diarrhea. It began 4 months ago and occurs 4-5 times per day. She says it is bulky, oily and hard to flush. She has lost about 10 kg over this time. She gets some mid abdominal cramping. She denies rectal bleeding. On examination she has an itchy rash on her arm. Her CBC reveals Hb 98 g/L, MCV 72, ferritin is 7 ug/L and CRP is 1.0 mg/L.  Anemia, microcytic, low ferritin.  So iron deficiency anemia.  Rash, little vesicles on extensor surfaces of extremities.  List 3 possible diagnoses:          Celiac’s disease.      Chronic pancreatitis → because of her steatorrhea, which is rather rare.      Small bowel bacterial overgrowth.                  This is more likely because she has diabetes which causes dismobility, which is a risk factor for bacterial overgrowth.                    Diabetic diarrhea                  Nerve damage due to diabetes, affecting motility.          Microvascular damage to blood vessels affects nerves, when this affects splanchnic nerves, diarrhea.                    IBD? Crohn’s.        How would you investigate her further?          Serology for Celiac’s → TTG. Recall it’s IgA, so you have to test their IgA levels.                  Patients with IgA deficiency have an elevated risk of celiac’s!          Also at high risk for anaphylactic blood transfusions (since exposure to IgA in blood).                    Anti-mycele? The one where you have to kill the monkey, monkey esophagus. EMA? Expensive, because also fluorescent.      Anti-glida antibody? Really old, really crappy. No one ever orders it. Neurologists sometimes order it for weird neurological diseases.                  HLA typing is useful for excluding but not including celiacs. Just like a D-dimer test. HLA DQ218?          Ab tests will suck if they’re already on a gluten free diet, so HLA typing will help here, because you can rule them out if they HLA DQ218 negative. If they’re positive though, then they’re either celiac’s and treated, or not celiac.           Should scope her because gluten-free diets are pains in the ass. So you should be sure of the Dx before committing them to it.          Duodenal biopsy (gold standard, no one does it).                      Her anti-tissue transglutaminase Ab level is increased at 75 and duodenal biopsies reveal flattened villi and intraepithelial lymphocytes. What would you recommend now?          No ‘BROW’ in your diet.                  Barley, Rye, Oats, Wheat.                    Actually took oats out of this, antigen is somewhat different from barley, rye, and wheat.      Still good to cut it out, since there’s a high risk of cross-contamination, with Barley, Rye, and Wheat.

	{"title": "Acute Liver Disease", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe the pathogenesis of Hepatitis C.  List the causes for acute hepatitis as defined pathologically.  Describe the mechanism of injury for acute hepatitis as definedpathologically.  Describe the clinical and pathological features of alcoholic hepatitis.  List five common drugs that may cause acute liver disease.  Describe the clinical features and principles of diagnosis and treatment for autoimmune hepatitis.  Classify vascular diseases of the liver.  Define Budd Chiari syndrome.  Describe the spectrum of disease in Budd Chiari syndrome.  Describe the etiology and pathology of passive congestion of the liver.Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)  Small RNA blood-borne virus discovered in 1989.  Not present in tears, saliva, or semen; hence blood-borne.  Major cause of post-transfusion hepatitis prior to 1992.  Major cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.  3% of the population (170 million) world-wide are infected.HCV Risk Factors  IV Drug-use → even if only once!  Blood transfusion prior to 92’.  Tattoos.  Body-piercings.  “High-risk” sexual behaviour (deemed as more than 35 partners → whoa!).  Recall the Rule of 3s for the risk of contracting diseases from needle-stick injuries:          For Hepatitis B, the risk is approximately 30%.       For Hepatitis C, the risk is approximately 3%.       For HIV, the risk is approximately 0.3%.       HCV Epidemiology  Affects males more than females.  Prevalence: About 1% → 300,000 Canadians are living with HCV.  Incidence: 8000 new cases/yr.  About 2000 cases will present as “acute” viral hepatitis.Natural History of HCV Infection  Slower rate of progression if:          Female       Young age at infection.        Faster rate of progression if:           Male      &gt; 40 yrs of age      Alcohol use      Co-Infection (HIV/HBV)      HCV Pathogenesis  HCV replicates in hepatocytes.  T-cell mediated attack on hepatocytes.  Cytokines produced, leading to mass inflammation.  Over time, tissue destruction and remodeling lead to cirrhosis.  These factors combine to produce chronic liver disease.Liver Transplantation  Hepatitis C is now the most common indication for liver transplantation world-wide.Treatment for HCV  Expensive → $$$.  76% cure-rate with PEG-Interferon and Ribavirin.Other Hepatitis VirusesHepatitis D Virus  Must co-infect or super-infect with Hepatitis B virus (HBV).          Like a teenager → can’t really do anything on its own!        Requires the HBV machinery to replicate and thus survive.  Aggravates and worsens active HBV.  Diagnosis: Anti-HDV IgM.  Treatment: Same as Hepatitis B (supportive care).  Prevention: HBV immunization. If you’re immunized for Hep B, then you can’t get Hep D!Hepatitis E Virus  Fecal/oral contamination in the Mediterranean Basin.          Basically the same as HAV.        Acute self-limited disease.  Only fatal to pregnant women in their 3rd trimester.  Diagnosis: Anti-HEV (CDC)  Treatment: Supportive care   Prevention: No vaccine; wash your hands/food.Hepatitis F Virus  They found a virus that they thought was a Hepatitis Virus, and called it the Hepatitis F virus.          But it actually wasn’t, so now we can’t use the name anymore. Whoops!      Hepatitis G Virus  Flavivirus.  Originally discovered in a surgeon.  Transfusion associated.  Parental (vertical) &amp; sexual transmission (horizontal).  Not a significant cause of chronic liver disease.  Clinical Note      All of Hepatitis A-G can present with acute viral hepatitis.    Only Hepatitis B-D can lead to chronic liver disease.  Toxic/Drug Causes of Acute Hepatitis1. Alcoholic Hepatitis  Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis:           Double the AST vs the ALT, but both &lt; 500.      The only time you’ll get higher numbers is with Tylenol.        Chronic Alcoholic Cirrhosis:          &lt; 20% of all drinkers develop this → there seems to be a genetic component to this.      Responds to abstinence.         Remember      An AST:ALT ratio &gt; 2:1 suggests alcoholic hepatitis.  Pathology of Alcoholic Hepatitis.  Alcoholic hepatitis looks different than viral hepatitis.  History of heavy drinking.  Not usually biopsied.  Mallory bodies and swollen hepatocytes with inflammation (not T-cell mediated) and fibrosis are seen if biopsied.           This fibrosis doesn’t form bands → it’s not cirrhosis.      2. Other Drugs  Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is SAFE!          However, &gt;3-10g is UNSAFE!.        Statins, if ↑ALT &gt; 3x normal.          Cholesterol lowering drugs (which have effects on hepatocytes), affect liver tests.      However, the change of having significant disease with statins is extremely small.        NSAIDS.  Antibiotics (typically clavulin).  Herbal medications.  Phenytoin.  Isoniazid (TB).  Amanita phalloides (Mushrooms).Other Causes Acute Hepatitis1. Autoimmune Hepatitis  Middle aged females (usually in late 30s or 40s).  Often known to have pre-existing/other autoimmune disorders.  Diagnosis:           High IgGs (&gt;2x).      (+)ANA.      (+)Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibody.      Liver Biopsy (confirmatory).        Marked necroinflammatory activity and numerous plasma cells.  Treatment:           Immunosuppress on presentation with Prednisone.       Maintenance therapy with Azothioprine (Imuran).       2. Vascular Liver Disease  Arterial/Hypoxic vs. Venous Congestion.  Essentially blood cannot get in or cannot get out of the liver.          Arterial: Circulatory Collapse.      Venous: Budd Chiari Syndrome or passive congestion of the liver (almost always due to Right-sided Heart Failure).        Budd Chiari Syndrome (BCS):           Budd Chiari Syndrome (BCS) → a spectrum of diseases characterized by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow.                  Obstruction can be at any level from the hepatic veins to the junction of the IVC and right atrium!          Presentation may very in severity from fulminant/acute, to subacute, or even chronic.          50% of these patients have an underlying malignancy.          Acute cases are typically due to hepatic vein thrombosis.                    Histology of BCS = centrilobular and sinusoidal congestion, with centrilobular necrosis, fibrosis and hemmorage.      Occurs in zones 2 &amp; 3 (around the central venule and just outside of it).         Passive Congestion of the Liver:          Increased hepatic vein pressure leads to centrilobular congestion with ischemic necrosis in zone 3 (the central venule).      Results in “NutMeg” Liver.      #1 cause of passive congestion of the liver is R. Heart Failure.      Right heart failure leads to backflow of high pressure into the liver.         Remember      Budd Chiari Syndrome is where you have obstructed venous output of the liver.  3. Metabolic/Genetic  Iron, copper, obesity/over-eating, Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP), Reye’s syndrome.  High iron → hemochromatosis.  High copper → Wilson’s disease.

	{"title": "Introduction to Liver Disease", "text": "Review of Liver Anatomy  You need to know:          The vascular supply.                  The portal vein supplies around 2/3 of the blood supply.          The hepatic artery supplies around 1/3 of the blood supply.                    The biliary drainage.                  Diseases that obstruct the intrahepatic, or extrahepatic bile ducts, can lead to cirrhosis.                      Blood flow in the Liver:          Portal Triad → Portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct.      Blood travels from the portal veins through sinusoids to the terminal hepatic vein, which then feeds to the inferior vena cava.      Substances in blood travel through fenestrated capillaries into hepatocytes, and vice versa.        Kupffer Cells are liver-specific macrophages.Normal histological appearance of the liver.The Cirrhotic Liver  Cirrhosis: A diffuse process characterized by fibrosis and conversion of normal liver architecture into structurally abnormal nodules.          Cirrhosis is the end-stage of many (but not all) liver diseases.      A histological image of a cirrhotic liver is shown to the right.      Pathogenesis of Cirrhosis  Fibrosis is caused by stellate cells.  Stellate cells produce collagen in the liver, in response to cytokines and inflammatory mediators (like TNF-α, IL-1, etc).          These are released by Kupffer cells in response to an insult.        When stimulated, they transform into a fibroblast like cells, which deposit collagen.  Collagen deposition impairs perfusion and blood flow, resulting in vascular shunting.          We end up with abnormal blood flow and intrahepatic shunting.        This leads to micronodular or macronodular cirrhosis:          Micronodular → &lt; 3mm.      Macronodular → &gt; 3mm.      Micronodular cirrhosis tends to be diffuse.      Macronodular cirrhosis tends to be less diffuse.      Micronodular cirrhosis is also more typically associated with alcohol.      Macronodular cirrhosis is more typically associated with viral infection.      Hepatitis from a Clinical PerspectiveClinical Definitions  Hepatitis → Any inflammation of liver (not necessarily a hepatitis virus).  Cirrhosis → scar tissue around liver preventing healing (not necessarily due to alcohol).  Clinical Hepatitis: → abnormal liver tests and they feel unwell.Clinical Signs and symptoms of Hepatitis  Flu-like illness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  Anorexia, aversion to cigarettes and alcohol.  Jaundice (unconjugated bilirubin), fever, chills.  Clotting dysfunctions may occur if you have fulminant hepatitis, due to a lack of clotting factors.Labs  Check ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, INR.          ALT and AST measure hepatocellular injury.      An ALT &gt; 1000 is suggestive of hepatocyte damage.        Elevated WBC or Igs.           Looking for lymphomas or autoimmume hepatitis.      Common causes of Liver Inflammation – Hepatitis  Infectious          Hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E).      Herpesviruses (CMV, EBV).      Parvo, syphillis, HIV.        Metabolic/Genetic          Hemochromatosis (iron).      Wilson’s Disease (copper).      α-1-antitrypsin deficiency.      Alcohol.        Toxic          Drugs → a lot of them, acetaminophen is the big one.      Environmental toxins → the classic (but rare) example is Amanita phalloides, a poisonous mushroom.      Hepatitis from a Pathology PerspectivePathological Definitions  Pathological definitions differ from the clinical ones:          Hepatitis → a necroinflammatory process, primarily affecting hepatocytes.      This can either be acute or chronic (where there’s fibrosis).      Characterized by apoptosis or destruction of hepatocytes by T lymphocytes.      Causes of Acute Hepatitis  For a pathologist, causes are generally broken down into drugs, viruses, or toxins.  Viruses can be:          Hepatotropic → Hep A, B, C, D, E.      Systemic → EBV, HSV.        Note that Hepatitis A is the biggest cause of acute viral hepatitis.  Remember      Hepatitis A is the biggest cause of acute viral hepatitis.  Hepatitis A  The most common cause of acute hepatitis.          Does not transition to chronic liver disease.      2 weeks to 2 months after exposure.      You don’t know you have it until it’s already in your liver and you’re secreting it and infecting others.      Asymptompatic or mild unless preexisting liver disease (and maybe diarrhea).                  If no liver damage, chance of mortality is low          If liver damage, mortality is 50%.                    However, the average adult with Hep A will miss an average of ~30 days of work.        Fecal-oral transmission.  Diagnosis → Check HAV-IgM for active infection.          An IgM antibody for the Hep A Virus, which shows whether you have an acute infection.        Treatment → No specific treatment, just supportive care.  Vaccination is 98% effective.  Hepatitis A      Most common cause of acute hepatitis.    Does not transition to chronic liver disease.    Mild course, unless there’s pre-existing liver disease.    Fecal-oral transmission.    Diagnosis via HAV-IgM antibody.    Treatment is supportive.    Vaccination exists.  Hepatitis B  Huge, especially in the developing world:          400 million chronic carriers globally.      9th leading cause of death world-wide.        Blood borne transmission → Sex, needles, IVDU, tattoos, or mother to child.  6 weeks to 6 months from exposure, as opposed to 2 weeks to 2 months with Hepatitis A.  With an acute hepatitis:          90% recover, 10% chronic, 1% die.      if newborns get Hepatitis B from their mother, 90% go chronic, since their immune system is more immature.      Pathogenesis of Hepatitis B  There are viral and host factors.          If you have an overactive immune response, you can clear the virus extremely quickly, but you’ll also rapidly kill hepatocytes → fulminant hepatitis.                  These are the 1% that die!                    On the other end of the spectrum, if you have a weak immune response (like in children), you’re unable to eliminate the virus, and you end up with a chronic infection.        Remember      Patient outcomes with Hepatitis B depend on both host and viral factors:              If you have too strong an immune response, you’ll end up with a fulminant hepatitis.        If you have too weak an immune response, you’ll end up with a chronic hepatitis.            Hepatitis B Serology      This stuff is going to haunt your exams for the rest of your career, so you better learn it!    HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen)          If you have an acute or chronic infection, this antigen is floating in you.        HBs Ab (Hepatitis B Surface Antibody)          Show that you have immunity to the virus.        HBcAb (Hepatitis B Core Antibody)          Shows exposure.      IgG indicates previous exposure.      IgM → acute infection.        HBeAg (Hepatitis B E Antigen)          E antigen = envelope antigen.      A sign of viral replication, so it disappears once the virus stops replicating.      We used to use this before DNA levels were used. Now it’s not used so much.        HBeAb (Hepatitis B E Antibody)          Another measure of immunity and clinical recovery        HBV DNA          Good measure of viral load, since the hepatitis viruses are DNA viruses.      Measured with real-time PCR.        Hepatitis B Serology      HBsAg → Hepatitis B Surface Antigen.              Sign of current infection.              HBsAb → Hepatitis B Surface Antibody.              Sign of immunity.              HBcAb → Hepaptis B Core Antibody (IgM/IgG).              IgM → acute infection.        IgG → previous exposure.              HBeAg → Hepatitis B Envelope Antigen.              Measure of viral replication.              HBeAb → Hepatitis B Envelope Antibody.              Another measure of immunity and clinical recovery .              HBV DNA → Hepatitis B Virus DNA.              Measure of viral load, largely replaced HBeAg.            Examples  Example 1:          HBsAg +, HBsAb -, HBcAb + (IgM), HBeAg +, HBeAb -.      Since the surface antigen is positive, you have a current infection.      Since the surface antibody is negative, you’re not immune.      Since the core antibody is positive, and IgM, then it’s an acute infection.      So this is acute Hepatitis B.        Example 2:          HBsAg +, HBsAb -, HBcAb +, HBeAg -, HBeAb +.      This person also has hepatitis B because the surface antigen is there.      Don’t be confused by the envelope antigen → when you’re looking for presence/absence, look at the surface antigen!      Since their E antibody is present, this suggests that this has been a lingering infection.      So this is a chronic carrier.The Hepatitis B vaccine is just Hep B surface antigen, which your body will develop antibodies towards.        Example 3:          HBsAg -, HBsAb +, HBcAb -, HBeAg -, HBeAb -.      This person had a previous vaccination, and is immune.        Example 4:          HBsAg -, HBsAb +, HBcAb +, HBeAg -, HBeAb -.      This is like the previous person, except the core antibody is also positive.      The presence of the core antibody (IgG), suggests that they had prior exposure to the virus.      This is someone who had a prior infection, and is now immune.        So by interpreting the Hepatitis B panels, you can determine whether the patient has active infection, chronic infection, or immunitySerological Course of Hep B InfectionThe window-period mentioned below can be seen between weeks 24-32, where the Hepatitis B antigen is gone, but there's still IgM Hep B core antibodies.  Note that there is a bit of a phase lag between where the Hep B antigen falls, and where the IgM antibodies fall.  This creates a window period, where:          Both HBsAg and HBsAb can both be low, making it seem as if the patient doesn’t have Hepatitis B.      But this may not actually be true → you have to check the HBcAb (IgM) to identify an active infection.      Prevention of Hepatitis B  Prevention → vaccination!          HBIG (Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin), can be given to babies with mothers with Hepatitis B, to try to mop up all their virus.        Diagnosis:          HBsAg for signs of infection.      ALT for signs of hepatocyte injury.      HBV-DNA for prognosis (viral load).        Treatment:          Vaccinate against Hepatitis A, because they don’t need 2 liver diseases.      Nucleoside analogues, prevents progressive disease, and the formation of scar tissue.

	{"title": "Histology of the Liver &amp; Biliary System", "text": "The LiverBasic Histology of the Liver  Rows of cells (hepatocytes), surrounded by spaces (sinusoids).          Sinusoids are thin-walled, leaky capillaries, that facilitate transfer of stuff.      Many of the liver cells are binucleated.        The liver is not only a filter, but it’s also a percolator:          It takes stuff out of the blood.      It puts stuff into the blood.      The Venous Portal System  A venous portal system is where a capillary bed pools into a vein, put then goes into another capillary bed.          In this case, blood goes from the intestinal capillary beds → portal vein → hepatic sinusoids → hepatic veins.        There are also arterial portal systems:          Seen in the kidney, namely the glomeruli!      Functions of the Liver  Absorbed products of digestion are metabolized or transformed &amp; returned to the blood.  Toxic substances in the blood are degraded or detoxified.  Bile is produced for release into the intestine where it plays a role in digestion of lipids.  The protein components of blood plasma is produced.  Carbohydrates are stored as glycogen &amp; released as glucose.          Maintains blood glucose.      Vascular Arrangement of the Liver  Hepatic lobules are the main functional unit of the liver.          Each lobule functions as a ‘filtering cassette’.      These are hexagonally shaped, and at each vertex, you have a portal triad, comprised of:                  Bile Duct.          Hepatic arteriole.          Portal venule.                    This is just like the larger portal triad that enters the liver!      Venous Arrangement of the Liver  Venous blood collects from the sinusoids into the center of the hepatic lobule.  This is known as a central venule, which then feeds to a hepatic vein, and eventually the inferior vena cava.Arterial Arrangement of the Liver  However, the liver also needs oxygenated blood to function, so the blood from the portal vein is insufficient.          This is where the hepatic artery comes in → the hepatic arterioles supply oxygenated blod into the sinusoids of the venous system.      That way, when the blood enters the hepatic lobule, there’s enough oxygen for things to function.        The mixed blood in the sinusoids is comprised of:          70% deoxygenated blood from the portal vein.      30% oxygenated blood from the hepatic artery.      Bile Duct Arrangement of the Liver  There are little bile ducts within each hepatic lobule that feed into larger ducts at the periphery of the lobule.  These then feed to even larger ducts, and eventually get to the left and right hepatic ducts.  This bile ultimately reaches the common bile duct, which functions to release bile into the duodenum.  Here is a histological image of a hepatic lobule.          A represents the central venule at the middle of the hepatic lobule.      B represents the portal triads at the vertices of the hepatic lobule.        The positions of the portal triads can be seen in the image to the right as well.If the number of layers of smooth muscle is &gt;3, then it’s an artery. If it’s ≤3, then it’s an arteriole.  Above you see a portal triad:          The portal venule has a large lumen, with no smooth muscle cells surrounding it.      The bile duct has a lumen surrounded by nucleated cells.      The hepatic arteriole has surrounding smooth muscle cells.      Cellular Arrangment of the Sinusoids  Hepatocytes lie directly adjacent to the fenestrated sinusoids on one side.  On the other side, they feed to bile canuliculi, which receive bile.          These then feed to bile ductules.        Kupffer cells are macrophages that are specific to the liver.          They help break down worn-out red blood cells, and also have an immune function.      This leads to another important role of the liver → it helps detoxify breakdown products of RBCs.      Intracellular Arrangement of the Hepatocyte  Basolateral domain → where the hepatocyte meets the sinusoid.  Apical domain → where the hepatocyte meets the bile canuliculis.  Space of Disse → the gap between the basolateral domain and the sinusoid.          This is where substances cross from the sinusoid into the hepatocyte and vice versa.      Carbohydrate Storage      Carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in the liver.    This glycogen is seen as dark spots histologically.          Ribosomes are also seen as dark spots → but glycogen spots are larger, are more irregularly shaped.        Another way to see glycogen is with a PAS stain.          PAS → Periodic acid–Schiff stain.      This specifically stains glycoproteins and glyogen.        Glycogen metabolism occurs in the SER.  Protein synthesis occurs in the RER.Hemoglobin Breakdown  Hemoglobin is processed by Kuppfer cells that roam the sinusoids, resulting in the formation of bilirubin.  Bilirubin is a toxic breakdown product, that needs to be made water-soluble in order to be excreted.          To do this, water-insoluble bilirubin is conjugated by a glucuronyltransferase, so it can be excreted into the bile.      Bilirubin is what gives the feces its characteristic colour.      The Gallbladder  The bile exits the liver via the left hepatic duct and the right hepatic duct.  These merge to form the common hepatic duct.  The cystic duct emerging from the gallbladder flows into the common hepatic duct, resulting in the common bile duct.  This then connects to the duodenum at the ampulla of Vater.  The gallbladder functions to coordinate bile release with the ingestion of food.  It has a great deal of smooth muscle to facilitate contraction.  The epithelial cells are highly vascularized, and form branching folds in the luminal surface of the gallbladder.          The blood vessels in the epithelium supply energy in order to facilitate the concentration of bile.        To do this, the cells of the gallbladder pump Na+ into the extracellular space.          This generates an osmotic gradient across the wall of the gallbladder, drawing water out of the bile.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Liver, Gallbladder, Celiac Artery, &amp; Portal System", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe the surfaces of the liver, attachments and porta hepatis.  Describe the hepatoduodenal ligament and its contents.  Name the branches of the celiac trunk, hepatic portal system and biliary tree.  Discuss the portal-systemic anastomoses and portal hypertension.  Case Example        A fifty-six year old man, slightly obese.    Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain radiating or boring through his back.    Elevated HR and BP.    Jaundice, ascites.    The physician you are working with suspects the patient is suffering from pancreatitis secondary to gallstones and alcoholic cirrhosis.    Gallstones are one of the most common causes of pancreatitis.  Alcoholic cirrhosis is often a contributing factor, but is not always the primary cause.  Case Continued        The CT is indicative of necrotizing pancreatitis.              Notice the size of the pancreas, and that its margins aren’t clear.        Also notice the change in coloration!              The patient was referred to a surgeon.    We’ll be looking at the anatomy related to this condition.  Anatomy OverviewHere we see the stomach changing into the proximal duodenum, the pancreas hiding behind it, and the liver and duodenum.Anatomy of the LiverThe Position of the Liver  The liver is in the right upper quadrant.  It lies in the right hypochondrium, and also the epigastrium, following the nine-region scheme.  It has a number of surfaces:          Diaphragmatic Surface → it’s attached directly to the underside of the diaphragm.      Bare Area → a region where there’s no peritoneum between the diaphragm and the liver.      Visceral Surface.      Leser Omentum.      Attachments of the Liver  The falciform ligament separates the right and left lobes of the liver, and also attaches the liver to the anterior abdominal wall.  There’s a thickening of this ligament named the ligamentum teres, that goes directly to the umbilicus.          The ligamentum teres is a remnant of the old umbilical vein.      It runs along with paraumbilical veins, that are usually too small to see unless they become enlarged due to some sort of pathology (will be discussed later).      Superior Aspect of the Liver      From the superior-posterior aspect, we see that the falciform ligament reflects to the right and to the left.They’re called coronary ligaments because they form a crown around the bare area of the liver!        These are the coronary ligaments, which surround the bare area (where the liver is in direct contact with the diaphragm).          These coronary ligaments are the physical attachment of the liver to the diaphragm.      When we remove the liver in the lab later this week, we’ll have to cut these coronary ligaments to detach it from the diaphragm.      Inferior Aspect of the Liver  The inferior aspect is also known as the visceral surface of the liver.  Just like before, we have the left lobe and the right lobe, but we also have another two smaller lobes.          Caudate Lobe.      Quadrate Lobe.        They look like they’re part of the right lobe, because they’re on the right of the falciform ligament.  But functionally, when you look at their blood supply and biliary drainage, they really function as more of the left lobe.  To remember their location, use the following mnemonic:          The cava goes along with the caudate, like ‘CC’.      The gallbladder goes along with the quadrate, like ‘GQ’.        Caudate and Quadrate Lobes of the Liver      The cava goes along with the caudate, like ‘CC’.    The gallbladder goes along with the quadrate, like ‘GQ’.    Because the visceral surface of the liver is facing the visceral organs, they can make impressions on its surface.          Stomach impressions may be seen on the left side.      Kidney impressions may be seen on the right side.      Colon impressions may be seen on the bottom right, from the hepatic flexure.        The middle region between the left and right lobe (with the caudate and quadrate lobes), is often referred to by surgeons as the H-Zone (drawn in dashes above).  Recall that the ligamentum venosum was the old ductus venosus, which allowed oxygenated blood from the placenta to bypass the liver.          One side of the H is formed by following the falciform ligament posteriorly, where it’s continuous with another fissure for the ligamentum venosum.      The other side of the H is formed by the line along the IVC and gallbladder.      The middle of the H goes through the portal triad, the 3 main vessels that are contained in the hepatoduodenal ligament coming off of the liver.                  Portal Vein.          Hepatic Artery.          Bile Duct.                      The H-Zone of the Liver      Along the visceral surface of the liver, is what’s referred to as an H-zone.    The H is formed by:              The line of the falciform ligament connecting to the fissure for the ligamentum venosum.        The line following the gallbladder and the IVC.        The line along the portal triad.              The Portal Triad      These are the 3 main structures that come off the liver, wrapped in the hepatoduodenal ligament.              Portal Vein.        Hepatic Artery.        Bile Duct.            The Lesser Omentum      Recall that the lesser omentum connects the liver with the esophagus, stomach, and the first part of the duodenum.Recall that if you sneak in behind the free end of the lesser omentum (at the hepatoduodenal ligament, where the arrow is pointing), you end up in the lesser sac!        It can be split into three components, as per its attachments:          Hepatoesophageal ligament.      Hepagogastric ligament.      Hepatoduodenal ligament.        The Lesser Omentum      The lesser omentum connects the liver to the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Hence it has 3 components:              Hepatoesophageal ligament.        Hepagogastric ligament.        Hepatoduodenal ligament → the one containing the portal triad.              Recall that the spleen is attached to the left kidney and the stomach by two ligaments:          The lienorenal ligament (aka. the splenorenal ligament)      The lienogastric ligament (aka. the gastrosplenic ligament).        The dashed line in the picture above shows the lesser sac, and the arrow shows the omental foramen → the entry way from the greater sac to the lesser sac.          This is the area right behind the hepatoduodenal ligament, which we stuck our finger in during one of our earlier labs.Recall that the ‘caudate’ lobe is with the ‘cava’ → ‘CC’        Hence, intuitively, the borders of this omental foramen are:          Superiorly, you have the liver (especially the caudate lobe).      Inferiorly, you have the duodenum      Posteriorly, you have the IVC (the blue vessel seen above).        Why is this important?            If you do an operation near the hepatoduodenal ligament, or in the lesser sac, and you’re being careless, you could damage these systems!      Of particular note is the IVC → if you accidentally tear the thin walled vein, you’ll have gushes of blood!!      An example of a surgical maneuver that’s done near here is Pringle’s Maneuver (shown right), where the hepatoduodenal ligament is clamped to interrupt flow through the portal triad.        Pringle’s Maneuver      Clamping of hepatoduodenal ligament to interrupt flow from the portal triad → portal vein, hepatic artery, bile duct.  Components of the Portal Triad  We’ll be going into more detail on each of the 3 main vessels within the hepatoduodenal ligament:          The (proper) hepatic artery.      The portal vein.      The bile duct.      1. The Hepatic Artery  The proper hepatic artery in the hepatoduodenal ligament comes off the common hepatic artery, which is one of the 3 branches off the celiac trunk.  Recall that the celiac artery was one of the unpaired branches coming off the abdominal aorta → the top-most one.  The main unpaired branches were (the CSI acronym):          Celiac artery.      Superior Mesenteric Artery.      Inferior Mesenteric Artery.        We saw in a previous anatomy lab that the celiac trunk splits into 3 branches as well:          Left Gastric Artery → supplies the top part of the lesser curvature of the stomach, as well as some of the esophagus.      Common Hepatic Artery → splits into 3 branches:                  Proper Hepatic Artery → named as such because this primarily feeds the liver (as well as the gallbladder). This is part of the portal triad!                          It feeds the gallbladder via a small vessel called the cystic artery.              If feeds the liver via the left hepatic artery and the right hepatic artery.                                Gastroduodenal Artery → supplies blood to the stomach, and the proximal duodenum. Of note is the right gastroepiploic artery branch, which feeds the greater curvature of the stomach along with the left gastroepiploic artery.                          Since is passes behind the duodenum and the pancreas to reach the stomach, it’s easily susceptible to damage by duodenal ulcers or pancreatic tumours.                                Right Gastric Artery → feeds the bottom part of the lesser curvature of the stomach.                          This means that the right gastric artery often anastamoses with the left gastric artery!              As a result, you have dual circulation to this area, and can cut one of the two while maintaining circulation to the region.                                          Splenic Artery → feeds the spleen.                  Also has a branch that feeds the greater curvature of the stomach → the left gastroepiploic artery.          This anastamoses with the right gastroepiploic artery, which is one of the branches of the gastroduodenal artery.                      Unpaired Branches of the Abdominal Aorta      CSI Acronym:              Celiac Artery → supplies foregut derivatives.        Superior Mesenteric Artery → supplies midgut derivatives.        Inferior Mesenteric Artery → supplies hindgut derivatives.              Blood Supply to the Stomach      Both the greater and lesser curvatures have dual blood supplies, which anastamose with one another.    Lesser Curvature              Left Gastric Artery → directly off the celiac trunk.        Right Gastric Artery → off the common hepatic artery, which comes off the celiac trunk.              Greater Curvature              Left Gastroepiploic Artery → off the splenic artery, which comes off the celiac trunk.        Right Gastroepiploic Artery → off the gastroduodenal artery, which comes off the common hepatic artery, which comes off the celiac trunk.            Branches off the celiac trunk in a cadaver. The splenic comes off the celiac trunk to the left, and makes its way along the top of the pancreas.2. The Portal Vein  It should be the biggest vessel in the portal triad, as well as the most posterior and the most thin-walled.  Where does the portal vein arise from?          It comes from the merging of the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein.      The splenic vein runs posterior to the pancreas, and the splenic artery runs superior to the pancreas, so the pancreas is a good landmark for differentiating the two.        The inferior mesenteric vein can vary in how it connects to the other vessels:          It can connect to the splenic vein, as shown below.      It can connect to the superior mesenteric vein.      It can even connect to the junction between the splenic and SMV.      Portal Systemic Anastamoses      The portal system is a separate venous drainage system from the systemic system (which drains into the inferior vena cava).Recall that the azygos veins drain the thoracic wall.    But there are anastamosing vessels between the two systems.  The 4 main connections are:          The left gastric veins anastamosing with the azygos veins.      The intestinal veins anastamosing with veins draining directly into the inferior vena cava in the lumbar area.      The inferior and middle rectal veins anastamosing with the superior rectal vein (which is part of the inferior mesenteric vein drainage).      The paraumbilical veins (which we said were beside the ligamentum teres) anastamosing with the epigastric and femoral veins        Anastamoses between the Portal System and the Systemic Venous Drainage  There are 4 main connections between the portal venous drainage and the systemic venous drainage:      The left gastric veins anastamose with the azygos veins.    The intestinal veins anastamose with the lumbar veins draining directly into the IVC.    The inferior and middle rectal veins anastamose with the superior rectal vein.    The paraumbilical veins anastamose with the epigastric and femoral veins.    Why is this important?          If we have a blockage of our portal drainage (eg. with cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, or anything that’ll cause compression), then blood will back up into the portal system.      Then this will enlarge these anastomoses → you’ll have swollen veins.        The most obvious of these are the ones right around the umbilicus (the paraumbilical veins) → this results in Caput Medusae.                  Caput Medusae → the head of Medusa.          This presents as swollen veins branching out from the umbilicus, which look like snakes spreading out.                    Sometimes, with distension of the rectal veins, you may get hemorrhoids.                  Anatomy wise, this makes sense, because portal hypertension will lead to dilation of the anastamoses of the rectal veins.          However, portal hypertension is not a necessary condition → you can have hemorrhoids without portal hypertension.                      Caput Medusae      Caput Medusae occurs with portal hypertension, causing the anastamosis between the periumbilical veins, and the epigastric/femoral veins, to be enlarged.    Back to our case from before:          Why did the patient with the pancreatitis have ascites?      We have portal vein obstruction due to the pancreatitis, leading to vasocongestion distal to it.      With the increase in vascular interstitial pressure exceeding the oncotic pressure, you end up with leakage → ascites.      3. The Bile Duct  Biliary tree.  The bile duct goes posterior to the duodenum, posterior to the head of the duodenum.  It dumps into the duodenum at the same place as the pancreatic duct.The Gallbladder      The gallbladder usually hangs down below the margin of the liver, and rests on top of the transverse colon.Recall that fundus means bottom, so the fundus of the gallbladder is the bottom-most region of the gallbladder!    The fundus of the gallbladder contacts the abdominal wall at the junction of the linear semiluminaris and the costal margins → this is a good superficial landmark!          You can see where this landmark is, plotted out on the right.        The cystic duct comes out of the gallbladder, and then merges into the common bile duct.  What forms the bile duct?          The cystic duct off the gallbladder.      The right hepatic duct off the liver.      The left hepatic duct off the liver.        This can be seen on the right, where the 3 of them merge into the common bile duct, and feed into the duodenum along with the pancreatic duct.          Since the bile duct and the pancreatic duct merge together, the bile duct actually gets incorporated into the head of the pancreas.      As a result, anything that affects the head of the pancreas (such as a tumour), will also affect the bile duct.      Anatomically, an ampulla is a sac-like enlargement of a canal or duct.  Where the common bile duct merges with the main pancreatic duct, you end up with a hepatopancreatic ampulla → a widening of the tube where it meets the duodenum.          This particular ampulla is also known as the Ampulla of Vater.      A sphincter at the end of the ampulla helps control the flow of bile. This sphincter is called the Sphincter of Oddi.      Where it enters the duodenum, it forms a little nub called the major duodenal papilla.You can remember the Ampulla of Vater from Darth ‘Vater’, and the Sphincter of Oddi from ‘Oddi’ wan Kenobi → Star Wars themed!        The Bile Duct      The common bile duct arises from:              The cystic duct off the gallbladder.        The left hepatic duct off the liver.        The right hepatic duct off the liver.              The common bile duct merges with the pancreatic duct to form the Ampulla of Vater, where it attaches to the duodenum.    The Sphincter of Oddi regulates the flow of bile into and out of the duct.    This explains why gallstones can cause pancreatitis:          Imagine if you get a gallstone, that escapes from the gallbladder, and tries to make it’s way out.      If it exits the cystic duct, and makes its way into the common bile duct, it’ll often get stuck in the ampulla of Vater.      This is because the sphincter of Oddi will prevent it from leaving into the duodenum.      As a result, it’ll end up blocking both your pancreatic duct and your common bile duct.      Since your pancreatic duct is still producing pancreatic juices, they’ll backflow, and you’ll end up with autolysis of pancreatic tissue.      This is one of the main causes of pancreatitis (gallstones blocking the exit of digestive enzymes)!      Case Example  Case 2      26-year-old female admitted with:              Mid-abdominal pain.        Vomiting.        General weakness.              What questions should you ask in her history?          When did you last have your period → rule out an ectopic pregnancy.      OPQRST →  Onset, Provocation, Quality, Region, Severity, Timing.      Are your eating habits and bowel movements normal?                  Answer: I seem to have trouble digesting my food and I feel bloated after every meal.          This suggests a problem with digestion, perhaps with the bile duct, pancreatic duct, or the pancreas/liver itself.  4.* Have you had any trauma or surgeries?*          Answer: Yes, I had my gallbladder removed 3 months ago.          This means she shouldn’t have a gallstone obstructing her bile duct or pancreatic duct.                    Anything else you want to tell me?                  I take Advil &amp; Aspirin for pain.                      Lab tests      Low hemoglobin.    Amylase and lipase levels previously elevated, now slightly lower than normal.    Fatty stool (steatorrhea).    Steatorrhea often suggests a problem with the pancreas, because it’s responsible for secreting lipase (which breaks down fats).  Imaging was done, and it revealed a pancreatic pseudocyst, which affected the release of digestive enzymes.  Final Diagnosis: Chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst and a pseudoaneurysm.          A pancreatic pseudocyst is a circumscribed (walled off by scar tissue) collection of fluid rich in pancreatic enzymes, blood, and necrotic tissue.      Typically in the lesser sac.      They account for 75% of pancreatic masses.      80-90% are associated with chronic alcoholism.

	{"title": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease Day", "text": "Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseFirst very important thing to not mess up:&gt;IBD is NOT IBS. Not even remotely close. Become very very very very sure of the fact that they are different.&gt;Recall that IBS is a functional disorder meaning there is no organic cause for the symptoms. As you’ll soon discover IBD has lots of fun pathophysiology to findThere are two disorders withing IBD (which may exist more on a continuum than on a dichotomy by some standards). They are:   Crohn’s Disease (CD)  Ulcerative Colitis (UC)Pathogenesis of IBDFor details in the pathogenesis you can refer to the following diagram:A simplified approach is to consider commensal microbes, environmental factors, and defective barrier function causing an unregulated, exaggerated host immune response in the GI tract. There is a genetic component to IBD as 15% of patients have first degree relatives with IBD, and monozygotic twices have a 30-50% concordance rate for CD. There are several gene candidates for this including:  HLA associations   NOD2 gene (a protein expressed in leukocyte and epitehlial cells)  NF-kB pathway can be triggered by microbes.The role of the intestinal flora has been inferred form animal studies with mice where they knockout the flora in mice that generally get IBD, and the disease disappears. There does not appear to be a dose dependence however (reducing the microbe load did not affect course of disease). The Microbes can gain access to mucosal lymphoid tissue due to the defective barrier function (mentioned above) and trigger and exaggerated immune response by providing antigens.The abnormal immune response is attributed to CD4+ T cell over activation, and under control by regulatory T cells. Several Environmental factors also affect IBD including:  Smoking (which actually can relieve UC while aggravating CD)  Diets  DrugsEpidemiologyPrevalence is similar between UC, and CD. Incidence of CD used to be increasing but has now tapered off to be similar to UC. There seems to be no gender trends between CD and UC. While IBD can most commonly show up in 20s or 30s, there is a second rise in incidence in the 50-70s.Disease DistributionThis has come up several times in discussions, lectures, small groups, so be sure to have this down pat:  UC has continuous colonic involvement beginning in the rectum and almost always staying within the colon (may sometimes affect the terminal ileum). In contrast CD has skip lesions where some areas of  small/large bowel may be unaffected, but bordered by affected parts.  For CD involvement common places are:           30% ileum and cecym      30% colon/rectum alone      40% small bowel alone      Can also affect esophageal, gastroduodenal areas as well (just less frequently)      Contrasting Pathological Features between CD and UCMemorize this tableA lot of the differences in presentation, pathology and complications can be explained from these differencesCrohn’s DiseaseLocal Complications of CDThere are several consequences of the fissuring ulcers that can form in CD  Perforation into the peritoneal free space  Fistulization with other parts of the GI tract, perianal region, urethral/vaginal tracts  Peri-enteric/perianal abscesses can formThe inflammatory process also causes fibrosis which can lead to:  Strictures (which can obstruct the bowel and may be a surgical emergency)  Adhesions (which may also obstruct the bowel)Developing dyplasia and cancer is also a risk of CD (although the risk is higher with UC). To screen for this most guidelines recommend a regular biopsy starting at 8 years and then every 1-3 years  Can detect the dysplatic mucosal changes which are precursors to adenocarcinomaThe following is a fissuring ulcer:It can be described as a knife like cleft cutting through granulomatous tissueSigns and Symptoms of CDCan included  Abdo pain  Diarrhea  Weight loss  Rectal bleeding  Fever  Nausea and vomitingThese symptoms generate a relatively large differential and CD is considered to be a great ‘mimicker’ in medicine for this reason.  The DDx can include:  Colitis from other causes (UC, ischemic colitis, infective colitis)  Appendicitis, diverticulitis  NSAIDS  Malignancy  IBS  Celiac  Radiation enteropathyThere will be exacerbations and remissions over the course of the disease, and in general the disease course is unpredictableSome clinical manifestations of CD to recognizeThere are several aspects of CD pathology to recognize clinically.  Ileo-colonic inflammation          RLQ Abdo pain      Diarrhea        Strictures          intermittent abdo pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting      treated with balloon dilation or surgery        Fistulas will present differently depending on location          If they are perianal they will present with mucous, discharge      If they are between segments of the GI tract you tend to get diarrhea (this is due to digested material skipping segments of reabsorption)      Treated with an enteral diet to minimize GI tract usuage. Medically with Metronidazole, Methotrexate, Azathioprine, Infliximab or with surgery                  important point: Steroids will not work to treat fistulas                      Abscess          Pain      Swelling      Fever      Be aware that CD can also cause Anemia and Diarrhea through several mechanisms, and these can have systemic effects. Systemically you can also get osteoporosis. This is caused by:  Glucocorticoids (iatrogenic!)  Malabsorption  Smoking  Immobility  Chronic inflammatory diseaseIt can be detected with Bone mineral density screening, and treated with Calcium, Vitamin D, BisphosponatesExtraintestinal manifestations of IBDWe’ll now bridge the gap between CD and UC by discussing several other manifestations of these diseases. While there is overlap between the two diseases, we will list each manifestation with the disease it is more commonly associated withSkin manifestations:  CD: Erythema nodosum, Apthous ulcers in the mouth  UC: Proderma gangrenosumEye lesions:  CD: Iritis, uveitis, episcleritis, conjunctivity  UC: Similar to above but far less commonMSK manifestations:  CD: peripheral arthritis (classic in cases!), gallstones, Kidney stones  UC: Ankylosing spondylitis, Primary sclerosing cholangitis, HypercoagulableInvestigations in IBDThere are no specific lab findings for IBD but several things can be suggestive:  CBC-increased WBC, platelets, Anemia  Electroltes, Urea, Creatinine abnormalities  Liver enzymes  Albumin  INR  ESR, CRP for signs of inflammationRadiology can also play a role in diagnosing/managing IBD  X Rays can be used in emergencies to detect perforation or obstruction  Small Bowel Follow through can detect mid bowel disease  US can detect Abscesses or Ileal thickening  CT scan can detect most complicationsColonoscopy  90% of the colon can be reached  Biopsies to rule out malignancy and determine severity should be performedManaging CDNutrition  There is NO diets that have been shown to induce remission or decrease risk of relapse.  In CD avoid foods that could cause a partial obstruction (ie uncooked veggies, salads, skins)  In UC avoid foods that worsen diarrhea (such as excessive dairy, caffeine)Treatment is dependent on severity/location of disease  Mild ileitis and right sided colitis          Budesonide                  Glucocorticoid with significant first pass effect from the liver, resulting in far fewer side effects than prednisone                    Oral 5-ASA                  An ASA analogue which must be enterically coated (or given by suppository) to be effective. This is very safe but only works in a smaller portion of patients                       Moderate to severe disease          Prednisone on a tapering regimen                  very effective, but has side effects                          Cushingoid, weight gain, acne,, depression, insomnia, osteoporosis just to name a few                                          Immunomodulators (azathioprine)      Biologics (infliximab)      Antibiotics may play a role by helping to control the intestinal flora. Commonly used antibiotics are Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole. These also help to treat abscesses and peri-anal disease.Immunomodulators- These have several functions including suppressing resistance to biologics, helping to treat steroid resistant disease, and inducing/maintain remission. There are several options:	- Azathioprine-Effective but has a 3% chance of causing pancreatitis	- Methorextate-Again effective but can cause liver/lung fibrosis and is teratogenicBiological agents will target TNF (infliximab, adalimumab) or Adhesion molecules.Surgery will be considered for major complications or failure to respond to medical treatment. Its not curative, and there is an aim to preserved as much of the bowel as possible	The management is summarized in the following table:Ulcerative Colitis SpecificsRecall a major difference between UC and CD is the distribution. UC starts in the left colon and can continue proximally along the bowel. The farther reaching the colitis the more severe it tends to be.Its important to be aware of major complications of UC that can arise that have not been previously mentioned:  Toxic megacolon with or without perforation          muscosal inflammation now spreads through the muscularis. Precipitated by constipating medications        Hemorrhage  Dysplasia and CancerClinical Features  Hematochezia (more common in UC than CD)  Diarrhea   Abdo pain           cramping with bowel movement      sharp localized pain is suggestive of inflammation        Dehydratio, malnutrition, fatigueIn general severity of clinical features correlates well with disease severity.  Acutely it can mimick an infection with chronic symptoms will continueIn the event of severe colitis the patient may present with:  Sever bloody diarrhea (&gt;10 movements per day)  Tachycardia  Fever  Low albumin  Anemia80% of patients will have intermittent flares, 10-15% will have continuous course, and 5-10% will present acutely requiring surgery. Investigations for UC  If acute rule out infection with Stool Culture and Sensitivity, Ova and Parasites, and C diff toxin tests  Sigmoidoscopy and biopsy for diagnostic purposes, but a colonscopy will determine the extent of the diseaseManagement of UCMedical Management includes:For mild/moderate disease:  Mesalamine (anti-inflammatory, kinda like a topical inflammatory to the bowel)  Sulfasalazine          Mesalamine with a Sulfa drug      increases side effects due to Sulfa drug.

	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Selected Topics in Pathology", "text": "  Case 1  A 40 yr old male came to the emergency department with a 24 hour history of vomiting coffee grounds-like material. He had a long history of alcohol abuse as well as a history of chronic dyspepsia. Upper GI endoscopy was performed, and an oozing gastric ulcer was identified. The endoscopist thought the ulcer looked benign. Endoscopic biopsies were taken.Notes  Vomiting coffee grounds-like material directs your attention to a gastric bleed.  An ulceration of the gastric mucosa must have occurred.  Bleeds occurring in the stomach mix with gastric juices; curdling the blood into coffee grounds-like material.   The blood also becomes oxidized, leading to the black colouration.  Clinical Note – Vomiting Blood:      Esophogeal varices will also bleed into the stomach.    However, the emesis of blood will be red in colour, caused by dilated esophageal veins that rupture within the esophagus.    The patient would likely have a clinical history of alcohol abuse and liver cirrhosis.    This is life-threatening and a medical emergency.  Questions1. What is Your Differential Diagnosis?  Gastritis due to alcohol injury  Chronic dyspepsia points to peptic ulcer disease  Alcohol abuse → ulceration.  NSAID abuse → ulceration.  H. pylori → ulceration.  Tumors are unlikely due to age of patient2. Why were the biopsies taken?  To rule out cancer.  Assess H. pylori status.  Pathological assessment is the only way to make this definitive diagnosis.  Case Continued  He continued to bleed from the ulcer, despite medical therapy, and eventually had a partial gastrectomy.Above (gross): Partial gastrectomy specimen with a gastric ulcer. The ulcer is punched out, gastric folds radiate right up to the edges, edges are regular and flat, not heaped up, base is bloody but clean with no obvious necrotic material.3. Does this ulcer look benign or malignant? Why?  This ulcer looks benign because it appears: punched-out, well-defined, and round with rugae converging at the ulceration.   If the ulcer looked malignant, the ulcer borders would be: mountainous, uneven and ill-defined.4. Can benign (peptic or NSAID-induced) gastric ulcers become malignant?  No, they cannot. Malignant ulcers can masquerade as benign ulcers but benign ulcers have no malignant potential.   Benign gastric ulcers are most often caused by NSAIDs followed by peptic ulcer/H. pylori etiology.   Benign does not mean it cannot kill you. Benign ulcerations have the potential to cause life-threatening bleeds.5. What are the complications of peptic ulcers?  Hemorrhage  Obstruction (especially at the muscular but narrow Pylorus regionthat becomes inflammed)  Penetration (denotes: onto other organs)  Perforation (denotes: into a body cavity space)  Case 2  A 60 yr old male presented to his family doctor with difficult swallowing for 3 weeks. This had been gradually increasing in severity. There was a long history of heartburn for which he regularly used antacids. He was referred to a gastroenterologist who performed an upper GI endoscopy.  Endoscopy showed Barrett’s esophagus, inflammation and irregular, partially ulcerated mucosa. Multiple biopsies were taken.  The patient was referred to a surgeon for definitive management. A distal esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy was performed. The tumor extended through the wall of the esophagus and there were 3 positive lymph nodes.  Pathological Note - Cause of Barrett’s Esophagus:      Metaplasia of the esophagus aka Barrett’s esophagus is caused by chronic esophageal inflammation from acid reflux (GERD).     The esophagus is lined with stratified squamous epithelium and changes to intestinal tall columnar epithelium with goblet cells to better tolerate and protect the esophagus from acid and pepsin.    The metaplastic intestinal epithelium is unstable and prone to dysplasia, which progresses to malignancy.    1. What is the pathogenetic sequence of events that lead to malignancy developing in this patient?  Metaplasia → Low Grade Dysplasia → High Grade Dysplasia → Adenocarcinoma2. Why is it important to biopsy patients with suspected or known Barrett’s esophagus?  Barrett’s esophagus is a pathological diagnosis on the basis of metaplastic cellular changes in the esophagus.  It is important to biopsy to monitor the progression of pre malignant changes to esophageal cancer before it occurs. 3. What is the prognosis in this case?  &lt;10% for 5 yr survival.   This case is very advanced and the prognosis is poor as the malignancy has spread through the esophageal wall and would be able to access other organs. Positive lymph nodes also suggests metastatic spread.  Case 3   A 36 yr old female went to her family doctor because she had noted some bright red blood on her stools and occasionally on the toilet paper. She also complained of fatigue. The family doctor performed a digital rectal exam, which revealed a soft mass. She was referred to a surgeon. The surgeon performed a colonoscopy.   The colonoscopy revealed a 6 cm sessile polyp, 2 cm proximal to the anal verge. Multiple biopsies of the polyp were taken.  The report is signed out by a pathologist as villous adenoma without malignancy. The polyp was removed transanally by submucosal resection.Notes  The 2 most common causes for a young woman to get bright red blood in her stool are:          Anal Fissures      Hemorrhoids        The key to this case is fatigue, which does not occur in either anal fissures or hemorrhoids. 1. What are the two commonest types of colorectal polyp?  Hyperplastic polyp (benign or malignant)  Adenomatous Polyp (benign gland-forming neoplasms composed of dysplastic epithelium) 2. How do these two types differ in their clinical importance?  Hyperplastic polyps have until very recently been considered to be innocuous non-neoplastic lesions but it is now known that these are a heterogenous group of lesions, some of which are neoplastic and pre-malignant.   Adenomatous polyps are the precursors of colorectal adenocarcinomas. The majority of these cancers arise from adenomatous polyps. Removal of an adenoma significantly reduces the subsequent risk of cancer in the patient.  The key fact is that is colorectal cancer is preceded by a benign lesion in almost 100% of cases, which is why the disease incidence can be markedly reduced by screening.3. Why was it deemed necessary to remove this polyp after the pathologist did not find malignancy on the biopsies?  Polyps demonstrate pre-malignant changes and biopsies of polyps may not be representative of the entire section.  Biopsies only sample the surface mucosa, so the entire polyp is removed so pathologists can determine if malignancy is present.  Polyps are deemed malignant in GI if the histological pattern shows invasion.  The risk of malignancy in an adenomatous polyp increases with increasing size of the polyp and is generally higher with villous adenomas than withtubular adenomas. 4. What type of clinical follow-up would you recommend for this patient?  Follow-up should contain surveillance colonoscopies every 3-5 years.  The patient is young, so she is at increased risk for developing more adenomas.  A family history must also be put together, as she may be a genetic testing candidate for Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC).  Individuals with HNPCC get adenomatous polyps and cancer at a younger age than those without the syndrome (however, these patients usually present with right-sided adenomatous polyps).   Pathological Note - Rule of 2’s for malignancy:      20% of 2 cm polyps are malignant.    40% of 4 cm polyps are malignant.    60% of 6 cm polyps are malignant.

	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Esophagus &amp; Stomach", "text": "Case 1  Case Summary  A 60 year old man presents to you with trouble swallowing. The dysphagia appeared three months ago and has been progressive, starting with solids but now occurring with thick liquids. He has lost 10 kg in weight.Notes  Dysphagia = difficulty swallowing  You can diagnose dysphagia with 3 questions:          Solid or Solid/Liquid                  This helps you determine if it’s a mechanical problem or a motility problem.          Solid → mechanical problem.          Solid/liquid → motility problem.          These make sense → if your GI tract isn’t moving anything, then you’ll have issues with both solids or liquids, but if it’s an obstruction, then liquids should be able to sneak through.          For instance, if there’s a problem with how we coordinate movement down the GI tract, then it’s more                     Progressive or Intermittent                  Some things won’t spontaneously get better (eg a tumour).          Other things may fluctuate (eg. an allergy).                    Associated Symptoms                  For instance, some problems may cause acid backflow, causing heartburn.          With a tumour, you would be looking at potential B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss).                      Discuss the clinical features that help to distinguish:          Oro-pharyngeal vs. esophageal causes.                  This would likely be esophageal.          We don’t see the typical features of an oropharnygeal cause.          Oropharyngeal Causes:                          “Choking sensation”              Saliva hypersecretion              Aspiration (and potentially aspiration pneumonia)              In more common with neurological problems → stroke, neuromuscular disorders, dementia (so, often the elderly).                                Esophageal Causes:                          Associated more with sensations of difficulty/discomfort.              A sensation of ‘sticking’ in the chest.                                In this case, it’s an esophageal problem → the sensation is more of difficulty/discomfort than choking, and there’s no history of neurological problems.                    Motility problems vs mechanical obstruction.                  Motility problems are associated with difficulty swallowing liquids.                          Often motility problems are associated with chest pain.              Patients will often also experience regurgitation, since a problem with motility will affect any aboral movement.                                Mechanical problems are associated with difficulty swallowing foods.                          They are a partial blockage, so liquid can pass through, but solids can’t pass through a smaller diameter.              With mechanical problems, there is usually no regurgitation, since there is still some room for food to pass through beyond an obstruction.                                In this case, it’s probably a mechanical problem, since he has issues with solid foods only, and we don’t see any regurgitation suggestive of a motility problem.                    Benign vs malignant strictures.                  Benign strictures:                          These are slow-growing (years)                                Malignant strictures:                          There are two primary tumours of the esophagus:                                  Adenocarinoma                  Squamous cell carcinoma.                                            These are quickly growing (weeks to maybe months).              Associated with weight-loss:                                  Solid food dysphagia and weight-loss puts malignancy high up on the loss                                            Risk factors:                                  Smoking is a risk for squamous cell carcinomas.                  GERD → Barrett’s esophagus is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma.                  Age, smoking, and caustic ingestions (eg. alcohol) are also risk factors.                                                                          What is the most likely diagnosis? What tests need to be done?          Probably an adenocarcinoma or a squamous carcinoma.      An endoscopy would be done (fairly quickly, considering the rate of growth).      If there was a better time frame, a barium swallow could be used for imaging.      Since this is a pretty clear-cut case, you might as well directly proceed to the endoscopy, because you can do a biopsy simultaneously.      Case 2  Case Summary    A 25 year old male presents with trouble swallowing. The dysphagia occurs with both solids and liquids. It is worse as the meal progresses. There is no pain.  If the patient lies down he frequently experiences regurgitation of non-acidic material into his throat. An upper GI series is shown at right.  What is the most likely diagnosis and why?          The most likely diagnosis is achalasia.                  We see the classic Bird’s beak esophagus.          There’s regurgitation of non-acidic material, suggesting that the material hasn’t reached the stomach before it got regurgitated.          The image is also pretty obvious. The lower esophageal sphincter can’t relax here, so you esophagus proximal to it begins to dilate.                    This is different from scleroderma, which deposits collagen in the muscle to make the sphincter weak, but peristalsis is still present → there would still be flow of acidic fluid.      Also, the patient is young, and is regurgitating (which aligns with a motility problem).        What tests should be ordered?          Manometry → test motor function      Endoscopy → take a scope to make sure there is no growth at the sphincter (eg. pseudo-achalasia due to cancer growing in the cardia, but this would be more likely in an older individual).                  Scoped people are at high risk for aspiration, so mind the risk.                      Describe the principle of therapy          Therapy aims to relax and open the lower esophageal sphincter:                  Medications: nitrates, CCBs (but this is not enough for a young person with severe achalasia).          Endoscopic treatment to physically stretch it out.                          Botox → this wears off in about 3 months.              Pneumatic dilation to tear the muscle (with a balloon) → this has a 5% risk of perforation.                                Surgery                          Surgical myotomy can be done laparoscopically in London.                                          Case 3  Case Summary  A 45 year old female comes to your office with a 2 year history of a burning epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the chest. It occurs typically 15 minutes after she eats and is associated with regurgitation of acid material into her throat.1. What is the most likely diagnosis?  GERD → Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.          We see this after meals (where more acid is secreted).      There’s regurgitation of acidic material into the throat.      We don’t see any signs suggesting otherwise (there’s a 2-year history, so it’s likely not malignant, and we see no oropharyngeal signs).      2. List symptoms that suggest complications:  Ulcers (evidenced by melena).  Esophageal strictures from acid reflux.  Lung problems like aspiration pneumonia.  Asthma (acid causing bronchoconstriction).  Acid reflux damaging vocal chords (hoarse voice).  Dental/gum problems.3. List potential causes / exacerbating factors:Of particular note are medications that are used to treat achalasia! Since they aim to weaken the tone of the esophageal sphincter, they would make GERD worse.  Diet (alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods).  Smoking.  Drugs → especially those for achalasia.  Pregnancy.  Scleroderma.  Obesity.4. When is endoscopy indicated?  Concern for Barrett’s esophagus:          Age &gt; 50, with chronic GERD (about 10% of these will have Barrett’s, and about 0.5%/year will develop esophageal cancer).      Family history of esophageal cancer.      Men, smokers, overweight, GERD and the amount of Barrett’s esophagus.        Complications: dysphagia, vomiting, bleeding, strictures or ulceration, potential cancer.          E.g. 30 year old who vomits blood with heartburn.      5. What is your approach to GERD therapy?  Elevate head off of bed:          Propping yourself up with pillows still makes you bend at the waist, which increases your intra-abdominal pressure and makes things stay inside your abdomen which exacerbates the problem.      Use bricks or telephone books underneath the bed posts! (raise the head of the bed about 10°-15°).        Dietary modification:          Types of foods.      Amounts of foods.      Don’t eat and lie down.      Space out your calories evenly across your meals (don’t load up on dinner).        Weight loss:          There is evidence to show that this improves symptoms in GERD enough to mitigate the need for medications.      Even 20 pounds can make a difference in a 200 pound person.        Stop smoking:          Nicotine relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter which makes it easier to get reflux.      It also dries up mucus (which protects it from acid) leading to ulcers.        Decrease alcohol  Medications (but discontinue harmful medications)          PPIs (prescription required) work very well, even prohylactically before a meal.      H2 antagonists (OTC) work well, but they are less used now that PPIs are so common.      Antacids (OTC) are a quick fix → TUMS is the mainstay in pregnancy.        Surgery:          Fundiplication: wrapping the stomach around the esophagus to create a barrier against reflux.                  It works pretty well, but a lot of patients end up back on PPIs 5 years out. Still, their quality of life is much better.          If there’s a hiatus hernia, they pull the hernia down before they do the wrap.                    Case 4  Case Summary  A 25 year old otherwise healthy male comes to your office with a 1 year history of epigastric abdominal pain. It is intermittent and seems to worsen after eating. It lasts 30 mins to 2 hours. He denies vomiting, weight loss and bleeding. He is a nonsmoker and denies NSAIDS. He feels otherwise well. He has mild epigastric tenderness on palpation.  What is the most likely diagnosis in this man and why?          A peptic ulcer.                  Post-prandial pain, most likely due to acid production.          Epigastric pain, does not radiate, so less likely to be GERD.          Young, otherwise well, so no reason for other diagnosis.                      Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most likely etiology?          Most likely a duodenal ulcer because he is young and there’s no evidence of NSAID use (which would be suggestive of a gastric ulcer).      Also, pain after you eat is more suggestive of duodenal ulcers.                  This is because the acid in your stomach is pumped out into the duodenum after eating.          Gastric ones sometimes actually ‘get better after eating’.                    With duodenal ulcers, the most likely etiology is H. pylori.        List potential complications and clinical features of each.          H emorrhage → melena (black tarry blood in stool), typical of an upper GI bleed, or vomiting blood.      O bstruction → pain, bloating, vomiting.      P enetration → pain (depending on what organ it’s penetrating into).      P erforation → pain, distended and tender abdomen, rebound tenderness and guarding because of peritoneal irritation, acidotic, in distress.        Discuss your approach to the diagnosis and management of this patient.          H. pylori serology testing and blood test.      Empiric therapy → give the patient a PPI and then bring him back.      If he’s H. pylori positive, eradicate it with PPI 4-8 weeks, with 10-14 days of two antibiotics.      If he’s negative, is it GERD or is it an ulcer?                  Can keep him on PPIs if his symptoms resolve, otherwise scope him if you think it’s an ulcer.          If he’s older (&gt; 40-50 years old), definitely scope him because you could be missing a cancer.

	{"title": "Microbiology and Medicine &ndash; GI Flora &amp; Infectious Diarrhea", "text": "So What’s Diarrhea?  The definitions of diarrhea are pretty vague and not always well agreed on but may include:          “An abnormal frequency and liquidity of fecal evacuations” (Normal frequency being anywhere from 3/day to 1 per 3 days”      Stools too watery or frequent for the patients liking      3 bowel movements in a day      Stool weight &gt;200g per day        At the end of the day → shit’s happening too much.Classifying Infectious Diarrhea  It can be useful to classify infectious diarrhea into various groups. A simple classification is based on whether it is inflammatory.  Non-inflammatory diarrhea is characterized (unsurprisingly) by a non inflamed portion of the GI tract.           The diarrhea results from issues with fluid/electrolyte absorption/secretion.      Organisms causing this will often produce enterotoxins leading to cell dysfunction.      These organisms include Cholera, Enterotoxigenic E. Coli (traveller’s diarrhea), Staph aureus, Bacillus cereus (the last 2 organisms are common cause of rapid onset food poisoning due to preformed toxins in the food).      Some organisms will cause non-inflammatory diarrhea without enterotoxins. These organisms include Rotavirus, Norwalk virus, and Parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium        Inflammatory is characterized by bacteria inflaming a portion of the GI tract, leading to fluid malabsoption and increased secretion          The GI tract cells can be damaged through either                  1) Cytotoxins          2) Direct cell invasion                    This diarrhea is often characterized by abdominal cramping, fever, and bloody stools (in general it appears more severe than non-inflammatory infectious diarrhea).      Anti-motility agents are contraindicated      These organisms include:                  C. Difficile (cytotoxin)          E. COli 0157:H7 (cytotoxin)          Salmonella (direct cell invasion)          Campylobacter jejuni (direct cell invasion),          Shigella (both mechanisms)          Entameoba histolytics (invasion of colonic mucosa and spreading through bloodstream)                    We will now examine the pathogenesis and specifics of some of these organisms.CholeraA very classical cause of non-inflammatory diarrhea. Due to contamination of water supplies in developing countries. The cholera toxin activates adenylate cyclase, leading to cAMP production. This leads to increased Cl secretion, and water osmotically follows the Cl into the lumen of the small bowel resulting in the “rice water diarrhea” typical of cholera.Note that Enterotoxigenic E. Coli produces the same toxin and therefore similar pathogenesisTreatment modalities include:  Rehydration (Oral if possible, IV if needed)  Antibiotics (if severe, cholera will resolve on its own. The antibiotics help to fight transmission and speed up remission)          Doxycycline      Azithromycin      Ciprofloxacin        Prevention          Sanitation (SURPRISE!)      Dukoral vaccine      Clostridium DifficileThis gram positive rod causes inflammatroy diarrhea by cytotoxin production. Most people would may have low levels of C. Diff in their flora, but sometimes it will ‘take over’ the GI flora due to antibiotic use or other stressors. Risk factors include:  Antibiotic use  Hospitalization  PPIs (unable to kill the C. Diff if ingested)  IBD  Chronic diseaseIf you suspect C. Diff a diagnosis can be made through:- Stool testing for C. diff toxin- Sigmoidoscopy which will should ‘pseudomembranes’ (white plaques)Treatment modalities include:- Supportive therapy (fluids, lytes, nutrition)- Stop previous antibiotics if possible- Metronidazole and Vancomycin (PO) are antibiotics of choice to kill off the D. Diff- DO NOT give anti-diarrheals-this could precipitate toxic megacolonE Coli O157:H7This gram negative rod usually causes bloddy diarrhea and will commonly resolve without specific treatment. In fact, treatment may increase rates of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, and is a part of the reason while not all infectious diarrheas should be empiracally given antibiotics.ShigellaThis gram negative rod both produces a cytotoxin and direct cell invasion. This organism spreads incredibly easy, and as few as 100 organisms to colonize a new host. This will resolve on its own, but antibiotics can be given to reduce risk of transmission and speed remissionEntamoeba HIstolyticaThis intestinal parasite is spread due to contaminated water or fecal-oral transmission, but can also be sexually transmitted (with a higher rate among homosexual men)There are 2 main points to the pathogenesis of entamoeba histolytica:  Invasion of colonic mucosa (this leads to ameobic dysentery)  Spreading to other organs via blood stream (ie liver) where it may form cystsAs a result of this the treatment is two part:  Metronidazole will kill the organism  Paramomycin will killl cystsSalmonella enterica serotype Typhi (Typhoid Fever)This infection is endemic to many countries, due to contaminated food or water. The Shigella bacteria will penetrate small bowel and cause sepsis.Diagnosis: Positive stool of blood culture.There are 4 stages to the illness which may help in directing clinical suspicion. Each stages will last approximately a week  Fever, bradycardia, ehadache, cough  High fever, bradycardia, delirium, rose spots on cheat, abdo pain, diarrhea or constipation  Bleeding, perforation, septicemia, delirium  Fever abates, recovery begins.Treatment:  Rehydration  Ciprofloxacin or Ceftriaxone  Prevent transmission by sanitation and vaccinationPrognosis:  Without treatment there is a 10-30% mortality rate  With treatment this rate dropes to about 1%  5% will become chronic carriers (Think of Typhoid Mary)An Approach to a Patient with infectious DiarrheaHistory  Look for prior history og GI disease,   Travel  OPQRST of symptoms  Other people with symptoms  Antibiotic use  Systemic symptomsPhysical Exam  Weight/nutritional status (with attention to any change)  Vital signs (with attention to hydration status)  Abdominal exam (looking for tenderness)Investigations- CBC, lytes, BUN, Cr (standard blood work)- Blood cultures if febrile- Abdo X-rays if severe symptoms- Micro studies	- Stool C&amp;S	- Stool ova + parasites	- Stool C. Diff toxin- Consider sigmoidoscopy if symptoms persist and are severe enough to warrant a biopsyHospital AdmissionNot needed for most patients, but consider if:  Severe systemic signs  Hydration difficult PO  Infants/elderly  ImmunocompromisedAnti-motility agentsCan use for watery diarrhea w/o fever (mostly).Never give in presence of bloody stools or if C. Diff is a consideration-this may precipitate toxic megacolon (massive dilation of the colon which requires emergent colectomy to repair)AntibioticsNot required for most. Consider if:  Shigella  C. Diff  E. Histolytica  Typhoid fever  Patients in hospital (but try to avoid for E. Coli 157)  Failure to resolve after 1 weekCipro is mostly a good choice, except for C.

	{"title": "Medicine and Pathology &ndash; Diarrhea and Malabsorption", "text": "Objectives  Define diarrhea and list the causes and classification  Identify key questions to ask when taking the history of a patient with diarrhea  Define malabsorption  Know the causes of malabsorption  Know how the various causes of malabsorption will present  Understand the pathogenesis, diagnosis, management and complications of celiac diseaseDiarrheaDefinitions  Normal bowel movements can be as frequent as 3 per day to 1 per 3 days.  Diarrhea → vaguely defined as ‘abnormal frequency and liquidity of fecal evacuations’.  This definitions include:          &gt;3 bowel movements/day.      Stool weight &gt; 200 g/day.       Increased stool liquidity.        Definition can also be done by duration of symptoms.          Acute Diarrhea → &lt;4 weeks.                  Usually infectious etiologies.                    Chronic Diarrhea → &gt;4 weeks.                  Usually non-infectious etiologies.          Of course, any chronic diarrhea has to start somewhere, so you may have an early chronic cause masquerading as an acute cause.                      Can also be classified by pathophysiology:          Acute vs. chronic, bloody vs. non-bloody.      Smalll bowel vs. large bowel.        Remember      &lt;4 weeks of diarrhea is suggestive of an infectious cause.    &gt;4 weeks of diarrhea is suggestive of a non-infectious cause.  Water Transport in the GI tract  There’s a balance between the water that’s entering the GI tract, and the water that’s leaving the GI tract (either by absorption, or excretion).          Water entering the intestine includes saliva, gastric secretions, and bile.      Water absorption occurs at the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon.      The colon is good at making up for any excess unabsorbed water, to maintain the balance.        Diarrhea occurs when this balance is disturbed, and the colon’s absorptive capacity is overwhelmed.          It’s almost impossible for this to happen by drinking excess water → the colon is pretty good at compensating.      Causes of Diarrhea based on Pathophysiology  Osmotic → too much water drawn into the bowel.          Osmotic (too much water drawn into bowels).      Ingestion (laxatives).      Maldigestion (pancreatic insuffiency, disaccharidase deficiency).      Malabsorption (celiac disease).        Inflammatory → damage to mucosal lining.          Infections.      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.        Secretory → increased secretion or inhibited absorption. Fairly rare.          Neuroendocrine tumors (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome).      Cholera        motility → gut transit is too fast.          Irritable bowel syndrome.      Classifying Diarrhea  One good way to classify diarrhea is by:          Acute vs Chronic → &lt;4 months versus &gt;4 months.      Bloody vs Non-bloody.        Acute          Bloody → dysentery.      Non-bloody → other infectious causes (eg. Giardia).        Chronic          Bloody → IBD.      Non-bloody → IBD, celiac, microscopic colitis.        Another way is to classify them by small bowel vs large bowel.            Small Bowel      Large Bowel                  Large volume      Small volume              Non-urgent      Urgent              Infrequent      Frequent      Diarrhea - Key Points on History  Nature of diarrhea:          Onset - acute or chronic      Bloody or non-bloody      Number of times per day/night      Oil droplets on toilet water (“steatorrhea”):                  Suggestive of a pancreatic problem, since it produces lipase.                      Associated symptoms:          Fecal urgency.      Incontinence.      Abdominal pain.      Fever.      Weight loss → suggests a more serious cause.      Energy level.        Risk factors:          Medication / antibiotic use.      Foreign travel.      Sick contacts.      Dietary history / water source.      Ethnicity.        Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD (Crohn’s, Ulcerative Colitis):          Mouth ulcers.      Perianal disease.      Skin rash.      Eye symptoms.      Arthritis (enteropathic).      Malabsorption  Inadequate absorption (duh) of nutrients from the GI tract.  the proximal small bowel (ie. duodenum) is especially important*.Causes of Malabsorption  Defective Intraluminal Digestion:          If you’re missing pancreatic enzymes like lipase or amylase, you’ll have problems digesting sugars or fat.                  These enzymes can be deficient, or just inactivated (recall that they’re released as zymogens).                    This also applies to bile salts.        Primary Mucosal Cell Abnormalities:          Your mucosal cells just don’t absorb stuff properly.        Decreased Mucosal Surface Area:          Your mucosa is working okay, there’s just less of it.        Infections.Defective Intraluminal Digestion####Pancreatic Enzymes- Fats, proteins, CHO (carbohydrates) hydrolyzed and solubilized by pancreatic and billary sections.	- Lipase breaks down fats.	- Amylase breaks down sugars.	- Trypsin breaks down protein.Deficient Pancreatic Enzymes  The main effects of enzyme insufficiency are on fat absorption.  Symptoms:           Severe steatorrhea.      Diabetes.        Treatment:          Low fat diet.      Pancreatic enzyme replacement.      Inactivated Pancreatic Enzymes  Caused by increased gastric acid → decreased pH →  pancreatic enzymes inactivated.Primary Mucosal Cell Abonormalities  Terminal hydrolysis of CHO and peptides.  Fats processed and packaged for export.Deficient digestion: disaccharidase deficiency  Disaccharidase deficiency → lactose malabsorption.  Lactase = brush border enzyme responsible for digestion of lactose (disaccharide).          Lactose → glucose + galactose.        Causes:          Decreased expression of lactase enzyme (in certain racial/ethnic groups).      Developmental.      Congenital.      Secondary e.g. after enteral infection (4-6 weeks).        Symptoms related to ingestion of milk products:          Diarrhea (osmotic due to unabsorbed lactose).      Bloating, flatus (bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed sugars).        Treatment:          Avoid milk products.      Lactase pills (eg. ‘Lactaid’).      What are the effects of Malabsorption?  Depends on what’s being malabsorbed.  Alimentary tract:          Diarrhea, flatus, pain, weight loss        Hematopoietic:          Bleeding (vitamin K), anemia (iron, pyridoxine, folate, B12)        Musculoskeletal:          Osteopenia and tetany (Ca, Mg, vitamin D)        Endocrine:          Amenorrhea, impotence, infertility (malnutriton), hyperparathyroidism (Ca, vitamin D)        Skin:          purpura, petechiae (vitamin K), edema (protein), dermatitis (vitamin A, Zn, essential fatty acids, niacin)        Nervous system:          Peripheral neuropathy (vitamin A, B12).      Celiac Disease  Recall that this was classified as a malabsorption syndrome caused by decresed mucosal surface area.  Synonyms: gluten sensitive enteropathy; celiac sprue.  Malabsorption in the proximal small bowel.  Immune disorder          Triggered by an environmental agent      Genetically predisposed individuals        A life long condition.          Withdrawal of dietary gluten → improvement        Prevalence:          1:300 SW Ireland vs. 1:5,000 North America      Low prevalence in Asia      Pathogenesis  Allergic reaction to toxic alcohol-soluble protein components in grains (prolamins) = antigens.          􏰂Gliadins - wheat gluten.      Secalins - rye.  􏰂- Hordeins - barley.        Immune complexes form in the mucosa, triggering an immune response.DiagnosisWe really only use the tTG-IgA test now, because the antiendomysial Ab test, while also very accurate, involves killing a monkey to get to its esophagus.  Serological tests → two big ones          IgA antiendomysial Ab.      IgA tissue transglutaminase Ab. (tTG-IgA test).                  This is what’s typically used.                    Must be on a guten containing diet at the time of the test, or it will always be negative.        Why are we looking for IgA antibodies?          Recall that IgA was localized to the mucosa.      Some patients actually have an IgA deficiency, which can cause a false positive with a serological test.        Remember      If you want to do a serological test for celiac, you need to order:              An IgA level to rule out IgA deficiency.        A IgA tissue transglutaminase Ab (tTG-IgA).              What do you do if the tTG-IgA comes back positive?          Then we also do a duodenal biopsy.      With the biopsy, we’re looking for:                  Loss of villi.          Increased intraepithelial T-cells.          Crypt hyperplasia.                    You also need to be eating gluten at the time, otherwise the biopsy may also completely normalize.        Why get a biopsy when a serological test is pretty accurate?          Celiac disease is a life-long condition that requires strict dietary changes, which are a pain-in-the-ass. So you gotta be pretty sure about your diagnosis.      Antibody tests are not 100% accurate.      Also helpful to establish a baseline.      Treatment  Gluten-Free Diet          Risk of many complications can be reduced.      Life long adherence is important.        Gluten is not only found in wheat:          Also found in barley and rye.      Also, oat products will often be contaminated with gluten.      Patients must thus avoid BROW foods (barley, rye, oats, wheat)        Some patients can eat oat products if they are prepared in a factory free of gluten.  BROW Foods for Celiac Disease      Patients with celiac disease must avoid BROW foods:              B → barley.        R → rye.        O → oats.        W → wheat.              Gluten is also a common additive to many foods:          Not only found in breads and cereals.      Also found in salad dressings, ketchup, soups, and just about any other prepared food you can think of.      To be gluten-free the patient needs to consult with a dietitian and read the label on every food product purchased.      Complications  Celiac patients need to be followed regularly over time to monitor complications:  Malabsorption syndrome → requires aggressive nutritional support.  Other autoimmune diseases.  Osteoporosis → due to impaired calcium and vitamin D absorption.          all patients should take Ca and vitamin D        Malignancies → rare but usually fatal.          small bowel lymphoma.      small bowel adenocarcinoma.        Dermatitis herpetiformis (seen on right).          Skin rash found in 5% of celiacs (on extensor surface of arms, buttocks, thighs).      Summary  Diarrhea = abnormal frequency and liquidity of stools.  Causes of diarrhea = osmotic, fatty, inflammatory, secretory, motility.  Diarrhea classified → acute, chronic, bloody, non-bloody.  Key questions to ask the diarrhea patient.  Malaborption = inadequate absorption of nutrients from the GI tract; proximal small bowel especially important.  Causes of malabsorption → intraluminal digestion,mucosal abnormalities, mucosal surface area, infection.  Complications of malabsorption.

	{"title": "Anatomy &ndash; Intestines, Blood Supply and Nerve Supply", "text": "Overall Objectives  Use knowledge of surface landmarks, planes, quadrants, regions to determine the position of abdominal viscera and.interpret pain presentation.  Predict the pathway infection/inflammation/exudate/transudate may take within the abdomen, spreading to/from lesser and greater sacs.  Use knowledge of blood supply to GI viscera to determine the extent of ischemia from ligation or obstruction.  Describe the correlation between GI visceral development, blood supply, innervation and lympathic drainage.  Extrapolate the anatomical structures, found on the cadaver and images, to histological, CT and radiographic images in order to interpret clinical findings of a given scenario.Branches of the Abdominal AortaUnpaired Branches  T12 → Celiac artery → liver, stomach, pancreas, spleen, duodenum.  L1 → Superior Mesenteric → jejunum, ileum, 2/3 colon      L3 → Inferior Mesenteric → descending, sigmoid, rectum		Recall that the abdominal aorta is retroperitoneal. So the branches that come off the aorta are also retroperitoneal. To go from a retroperitoneal position to feed intraperitoneal structures, these vessels travel through the mesenteries. Hence they’re called the superior and inferior mesenteric vessels.    Recall that blood supply travels in mesenteries and follows development of gut.           Celiac artery → foregut.      Superior Mesenteric Artery → midgut.      Inferior Mesenteric Artery → hindgut.        For this lecture we’ll only be looking at the latter two vessels → the SMA and the IMA.          The celiac trunk will be discussed in more detail in Anatomy of the Liver, Gallbladder, Celiac Artery, &amp; Portal System.        Remember      The celiac trunk comes off at the level of T12, right above the SMA.    The SMA comes off at the level of L1, at the transpylotic plane.    The IMA comes off at the level of L3, at the umbilicus.  SMA comes off at the level of L1, at the transpyloric plane. The IMA comes off at L3, at the umbilicus.The Superior Mesenteric ArteryThe SMA can become occluded if there is abnormal growth of the pancreas, since it’s wedged inside it.  Comes off at L1, behind the pancreas.  Passes between the neck and uncinate process of pancreas.  Even though the SMA feeds midgut structures, it also branches to the pancreas and duodenum, which are foregut structures.          This is through the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery.      Branches of the SMAIf the midgut rotates around the SMA too much in development, we can get twisting of the SMA, leading to an ischemic small intestine. That’s because the SMA is the only vessel supplying the small intestine!  Middle Colic → the 1st branch coming off the SMA. Supplies the ‘middle’ of the colon → the transverse colon.   Right Colic → supplies the ascending colon.  Intestinal → small branches that supply the small intestine.   Ileocolic → supplies cecum, ileum, appendix.           Since the ileocolic artery supplies the ileocecal region, it’s sometimes also called the ileocecal artery.      Jejunal vs Ileal branches of SMA  The intestinal arteries feeding the jejenum and ileum can be differentiated based on the arrangment of blood supply:          The jejenum has few arterial arcades (1-2 rows) and long vasa recta.      The ileum has many arterial arcades (4-5 rows) and short vasa recta.        The vasa recta (‘straight vessels’) are the straight blood vessels that feed into the jejunum/ileum.  Comparing their vessel arrangement is one of the only ways to differentiate these grossly.  Remember      The jejunum has few branches, but they’re long.    The ileum has many branches, but they’re short.  The Inferior Mesenteric Artery  Comes off quite a bit lower, at the L3 level.      Look for it just above the bifurcation of the aorta into the common iliac arteries. These hindgut structures are the sescending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum.     Supplies hindgut structures:          This is basically the left side of the colon.      The IMA’s branches also anastamose with right sided vessels.      So a blockage of IMA does not result in ischemia of this region due to right sided anastomoses.       Branches of the IMA  Left Colic → supplies the left colon.  Marginal Artery (of Drummond) → branches off the left colic, travels along the margins of the left colon.          Anastamoses with the middle colic off the right side.        Sigmoid Artery → supplies the sigmoid colon. May have more than one.  Superior Rectal → supplies the superior rectum.          Further down, when it enters the pelvis, blood supply comes from pelvic structures.      IMA Radiographs  Important: Ischemia is a concern in low-flow areas, especially aroundthe watershed/splenic flexure area.           Even though it’s fed by both the marginal artery and its anastamosis with branches of the middle colic artery, these vessels are small, so perfusion may be insufficient.        Diagram on right:          1 → Catheter putting dye in IMA      3 → Superior rectal artery      4 → Sigmoidal branches      5 → Left colic        7 → Marginal artery of Drummond is followed to 7, which is the kidney.      Venous Drainage of the IntestineVenous System  Mesenteric veins from the intestines drain into the portal vein → they do not drain directly to the IVC.  Splenic Vein → drains the spleen, posterior to stomach.  Superior Mesenteric Vein → drains the right side of colon.  Inferior Mesenteric Vein → drains the left side of colon.  Dumps into either splenic vein, SMV, or directly into portal vein.    Junction of splenic vein and the SMV form portal vein entering the liver.  Remember      The junction of the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein form the portal vein entering the liver.  The Jejenum and Ileum  Intraperitoneal, so still attached by mesentery.  You may have a lot of visceral fat around the mesenteries, making it difficult to see blood vessels.          Visceral fat → around organs, more associated with cardiovascular problems.      Superficial (subcutaneous) fat → less associated with cardiovascular problems.        The duodenojejunal flexure differentitates upper and lower GI bleeds.           It’s suspended by the ligament of Treitz.      The Large Intestine  The large intestine begins at the ileocaecal junction.  The appendix is typically inferior to cecum and indicates that we’re at the large intestine.  Tenea coli are longitudinal strands of muscle that are characteristic of the large intestine.  Position of appendix is quite variable, which complicates diagnosis.The Appendix  Patient Case  19 year old female presents with dull but intense umbilical pain that spreads to the right inguinal region. Hip extension increases umbilical pain and deep pelvic pain is experienced as well.   Umbilical pain means L3.  Important: R/O Pregnancy should be the first thing you do, in any (fertile) female presenting with abdominal pain.  This is a case of appendicitis. Psoas Sign  The patient presented with Psoas Sign           Hip extension stretches the psoas muscle.      The appendix is inflamed and is tucked in the pelvic area, attaching itself to the overlying fascia of the psoas muscle.       Pulling of the inflamed appendix during extension results in pain.      So this is an individual with an inflamed appendix overlying the psoas.       Obturator Sign  The Obturator Sign (Adductor sign) is another sign of an inflamed appendix.          This is positive with a long inflamed appendix handing over the pelvic brim, and overlying the obturator muscle.      This muscle is an external rotator, so if you stretch it by internally rotating the hip.      This is done by rotating the hip by moving the patient’s ankle away from the patient’s body while allowing the knee to move only inward.        Signs of Appendicitis      Psoas Sign → pain with hip extension, suggesting an inflamed appendix over the psoas.    Obturator Sign → pain with hip internal rotation, suggesting an inflamed appendix over the obturator.  The ColonComponents of the Colon  Ascending colon → coming up off the ileocecal junction.  Hepatic flexure → where it bends at the liver. Also known as the right colic flexure.  Transverse Colon → becomes intraperitoneal here.  Splenic flexure → where it bends again near the spleen. Also known as the left colic flexure.  Descending colon → becomes secondary retroperitoneal again.  Sigmoid colon → comes off the abdominal wall and becomes intraperitoneal again.  Rectum → again becomes retroperitoneal.  The Teniae coli of the large intestine are under chronic contraction, causing a puckering appearance.  These indentations are known as haustra and are very typical of the large intestine.  Apendices epiploicae are fat tags hanging off the colon. They are very typical of the large intestine as well.          Unlike the small intestine where fat hangs in the mesentery, the fat attaches to the intestine itself.        The lines of fusion where the ascending and descending colon attach to the abdominal wall are called lines of Toldt.          This is what you have to cut when you’re performing a colectomy.        Remember      In the small intestine, fat attaches to the mesenteries.    In the large intestine, fat attaches to the intestine itself.  Rectum &amp; AnusRectum  Supported by a muscles of the pelvic diaphragm.  The teniea coli end here.  As it passes through the pelvic diaphragm, it becomes the anal canal.Anus  Anal columns → ridges at the junction between the rectum and the anus.          These represent mucous membranes overlying blood vessels.        Opening is controlled by sphincters.  Blue line is the pectinate line, which marks the transition of GI columnar epithelium to anal stratified squamous epithelia.  Black line on the diagram is known as the white line which marks keratinization as there is continuation with the skin.  The internal sphincter is under involuntary control.  The external sphincter is under voluntary control.          This is what you strain when you’re struggling to hold your shit in!        Remember      The pectinate line (aka. dentate line) marks the transition between the GI simple columnar epithelium into anal stratified squamous epithelium.    The white line comes after the pectinate line, and marks where the stratified squamous epithelium becomes keratinized.  Lymphatics  Lymphatic drainage follows the vessels.          All of the lymph ultimately feeds into the thoracic duct.        Peripheral nodes are located on the gut wall.  You can see this arrangement on the right.          Here you see that the lymph nodes track along the common iliacs and the abdominal aorta.      Radiographs  Remember      Always look for leaks, obstructions, masses      Look for diameter, plicae, haustra.      The most common cause of obstruction is adhesions.Post-op ensure that the patient is passing gas to confirm there is no obstruction.    These adhesions are commonly seen with post-op surgery, hernias, and tumours.Splenic flexure is identified. The wall of the colon is thickened. Some sort of colitis is occuring. A cyst is identified in the pancreas.Diaphragmatic hernia Large intestines are pushed up through diaphragm.Abdominal Visceral Innervation  Your peritoneum is innervated by somatic nerves, so you can feel somatic pain.  Your viscera are innervated by autonomic afferents/efferents, and you only feel visceral pain.Somatic vs. Visceral pain   We’ll be focusing on 3 nerve plexuses, which follow the location of the blood supply:          Celiac Plexus.      Superior Mesenteric Plexus.      Inferior Mesenteric Plexus.        Since they innervate the viscera, they are autonomic plexuses.Autonomic innervation follows development and blood supply Sympathetic Innervation  Coming off your spinal cord, you have nerves that don’t actually synapse with the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic chain → these are the splanchnic nerves.  The splanchnic nerves that feed to the celiac plexus, superior mesenteric plexus, and inferior mesenteric plexus are:          T5-T9 supply the foregut and go to the celiac ganglion.      T10-T12 supply the midgut and go to the superior mesenteric ganglion.      L1, S2-S4 supply the hindgut and go to the inferior mesenteric ganglion.        These inhibit digestion, and let you feel visceral pain.Innervation to abdominal visceraParasympathetic Innervation  Vagus innervates the foregut and midgut.  S2,3,4, pelvic splanchnics do the hindgut.  These are mainly responsible for digestion.The reason you feel referred pain is because the viscera is innervated by the same nerve that feed to cutaneous dermatomes.Application of Abdominal Innervation:  Presentation of Appendicitis:          Pain originally felt in epigastric or umbilical region.      Early stage: Dull unlocalized pain. Conveyed by visceral affarents (viscera).                  At this point, the pain is only sensed by the autonomic nerves, so you only feel visceral pain.                    Late stage: Sharp localized pain. Conveyed by somatic afferents (parietal peritoneum).                  When the appendicitis gets bad enough, it can actually irritate the peritoneum, which is somatically innervated.                      Murphy’s Sign:          When you breathe in, the liver and gallbladder drops down to the region between the right linea semiluminaris and the costal margin.      If the gallbladder is inflammed, and you’re touching this point, then the patient will stop breathing in from pain.      If this cannot be replicated on the left side, then this is a positive Murphy’s sign.        McBurney’s Point:          The name given to the point over the right side of the abdomen that is one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus (navel).      This is the most common location of the base of the appendix where it attaches to the cecum.

	{"title": "Pathology &amp; Pharmacology &ndash; Stomach &amp; Duodenum", "text": "Lecture Overview  Gastric Anatomy.  Stomach Physiology  Gastritis.  Peptic Ulcer Disease.          Pathophysiology.      Clinical approach.      Pharmacology.      Treatment.      Gastric Anatomy  Parts of the stomach include:          Cardia → portion of the stomach where the esophagus joins it.      Fundus → top part of the stomach, where food fills.      Body → the main, central region of the stomach.      Antrum &amp; Pylorus → helps push food into the small intestine.         The stomach has lots of collateral vessels feeding it, so it’s difficult for it to become ischemic.  Blood supply → left/right gastric arteries, and the left/right gastroepiploic arteries.Function of the Stomach  The stomach is functionally split into an upper half and a lower half:          Upper half → reservoir, acid secretion, receptive relaxation.      Lower half → pump/grinder, peristaltic activity, and control of acid secretion.        Remember      THe upper half (fundus, body) of the stomach is a reservoir, and secretes acid.    The lower half (antrum) of the stomach is a pump/grinder, and controls acid secretion.  Stomach PhysiologyGastric Motility  There are two types of motility:          Fed State → mixing, peristalsis.      Fasted State → MMC (recall, the Migrating Myoelectric Complex).        The fundus and body is resonsible for receptive relaxation (expanding to accomodate more food).          The stomach is a potential space! You don’t actually have free space in your stomach when you’re hungry, it just expands to accomodate more food.        The antrum is responsible for peristalsis (leading to pumping and grinding), and also control of acid secretion.Acid SecretionThis image is somewhat out of date, but it shows 3 of the 5 cell types you need to know of: the parietal cell, superficial epithelial cell, and ECL cell.1. Parietal Cells  Recall that HCl is secreted by parietal cells.  These are the main target of acid reduction pharmacology.  Parietal cells have different things on their apical and basolateral surfaces:  Apical Surface:          Proton-pumps → these are the target of proton-pump inhibitors.      K+/Cl- channels.        Basolateral Surface:          Muscarinic receptors in response to acetylcholine.      Gastrin receptor, now called a CCK-B receptor.  Actually, only H1 antagonists are referred to as antihistamines; H2 antagonists are not!      Histamine receptor (H2 subtype)                  These are H2 type receptors, so H1 histamine antagonists don’t block acid secretion.          So H2-antagonists are what are used to reduce acid production.                    Prostaglandin receptor                  These differ from the other receptors in that they negatively regulate acid production.                    2. Superficial Epithelial Cells (Surface Mucous Cells)  Recall that superficial epithelial cells produce mucin and bicarbonate.  Both of these act as cytoprotection against the acidic milieu of the stomach.  They have prostaglandin receptors and M3 muscarinic receptors on their basolateral surface that act to trigger the production of this mucin and bicarbonate.3. ECL Cell  Enterochromaffin-like cells or ECL cells are a type of neuroendocrine cells found near parietal cells.  They secrete histamine in response to gastrin and muscarinic innervation from the enteric nervous system.This figure is more up to date, but doesn't show the epithelial cells. It only shows the parietal cell, ECL cell, D cell, and G cell.4. D Cell  D Cells release somatostatin.5. G Cell  G Cells release gastrin.  They also have somatostatin receptors that respond to somatostatin from D cells.          Somatostatin inhibits the release of gastrin.        Stimulants of Acid Secretion  There are 3 major stimulators of acid secretion.      Histamine: from ECL cells, acts on parietal cell H2 receptors.      Gastrin: stimulates ECL cells to release histamine.     Acetylcholine: also stimulates ECL cells.    Inhibiting histamine has the greatest effect on acid secretion. Side note: vomiting results in hypocholoremic alkalosis, since gastric secretions have lots of chloride ions and H+. Stimulation of Acid Secretion  We have a basal acid secretion, which maintains acidity (~10% of maximum).  We also have a stimulated acid secretion as a result of different stimuli:          Cephalic: 30% due to thinking about food.       Gastric: 60% due to gastrin mediated effects.                   Calcium, alcohol and caffeine stimulate acid release (hence they’re risk factors for GERD).                    Intestinal: 10%, mechanism unknown.        Acetylcholine, Gastrin, and Histamine  Mucin → protects gastric mucosa from low pH, and lubricates the stomach  Intrinsic Factor → released by parietal cells along with HCl.          Facilitates Vitamin B12 absorption.      Pernicious anemia → auto-antibodies against parietal cells, resulting in a lack of acid and IF → reduced vitamin B12 absorption.G cells are a type of entero-endocrine cell, which is what we looked at in Histology of the GI Tract.        Gastrin → released by antrum G cells in response to amino acids and polypeptides, vagal activity, and stomach distension.          Stimulates parietal cells and causes ECL cells to release histamine.      Negative feedback loop in response to acid.         Key Points to Focus on      The roles of acetylcholine, gastrin.and histamine in the production of acid.    The unique proton pump in the membrane of parietal cells.    The inhibitory activity of prostaglandins.    The cytoprotective factors produced by superficial epithelial cells.    The potential target sites for drug action.  Gastritis  Gastritis → inflammation of the stomach.  Gastritis can be acute or chronic.Acute Gastritis  Causes of acute gastritis:          Chemical injury → NSAIDs, alcohol, steroids, bile.      Stress → patients with burns, CNS trauma, shock, sepsis.      Pathogenesis of Acute Gastritis  If due to chemical injury, caused by either:          Decreased mucin production.      Prostaglandin deficiency.                  What you usually see with NSAID use → NSAIDs block the prostaglandin pathway!.          Recall that prostaglandins are cytoprotective (increase mucin and bicarbonate production from surface mucous cells).                      If due to physiologic stress, it’s caused by:          Microvessel ischemia.                  An ischemic mucosa will look the same as what’s caused by chemical injury.                    Chronic Gastritis  Causes of chronic gastritis:          Heliobacter pylori.      Chemical.      Autoimmune.      Other.      Heliobacter pylori  Heliobacter pylori is the #1 cause of gastritis, duodenal ulcers, and more.  Curved, gram negative bacillus, with a flagellum at the end.  Well-adapted to surviving the hostile gastric microclimate.          Uses its flagellum to propel itself into the mucous layer of the stomach, to insulate itself from the acid.      Once it’s in the mucous layer, it produces urease → breaks down urea into bicarbonate and ammonia. The bicarbonate makes the environment more alkaline.      It has adhesins that let it adhere to the epithelial surface.      It releases toxins which stimulate an inflammatory response.      Because of the more alkaline pH it produces with its urease, there are compensatory endocrine effects (↓somatostatin, ↑gastrin).                   The resulting increased acid production then causes problems further down the GI tract.                    Natural history of H. pylori infection  H. pylori infection can have a number of different outcomes.  Chronic active gastritis → lots of acute inflammatory cells infiltrating the gastric glands.  This can develop into:          Chronic gastritis → transition from acute inflammation to chronic inflammation.      Peptic ulcer → will be discussed later this lecture.      MALT lymphoma:                  MALT = Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.          Persistent inflammatory stress on the stomach can cause the stomach to develop persistent lymphoid tissue → MALT.          Out of this group, an abnormal clone can develop, resulting in a MALT lymphoma.          Early on, the abnormal clone requires persistent inflammatory stimulation to keep growing, so if you kill the H. pylori early on, you don’t need chemotherapy.          However, in later stages, the clone becomes less differentiated, and can grow autonomously.                    Adenocarcinoma → carcinoma of the gastric glands.                  Develops as a result of multifocal atrophic gastritis → atrophy of the mucous cells.          These cells are then replaced by intestinal metaplastic cells.          Just like with Barrett’s esophagus, these are prone for dysplasia.                      Remember      The two neoplastic complications of H. pylori infection are:              MALT lymphoma.        Adenocarcinoma.            Peptic Ulcer DiseaseUlcer = breach, or hole in the mucosa. These differ from erosions by the fact that an erosion will not breach the muscularis mucosa, while an ulcer will.   Peptic ulcers are chronic, solitary ulcers, that are benign.  These can be classified as:          Gastric ulcers (GU).      Duodenal ulcers (DU).        Peptic Ulcers      Peptic Ulcers can either be:              Gastric ulcers.        Duodenal ulcers.            Pathophysiology of Peptic Ulcer Disease  In the stomach, there’s a constant balance between two forces:          Damaging forces → acids, peptic enzymes, H. pylori.      Protective forces → bicarbonate, mucous, prostaglandins, adequate blood supply.        If this balance is lost, due to increased damage or impaired defense, then gastric mucosal damage will occur.  The majority of ulcers caused by an increase in damaging factors are due to H. pylori, and they usually cause duodenal ulcers.          This makes sense → H. pylori causes compensatory endocrine effects which increase acid levels further down the GI tract.      This can be seen in the figure on the right.        The majority of ulcers caused by a loss in protective factors are due to NSAIDs, and they usually cause gastric ulcers.          This also makes sense → recall that NSAIDs block prostaglandins, which stimulate mucin and bicarbonate production.      This results in a local loss of protection.        Note: Not all gastric ulcers are peptic! Some are ulcerating cancers.  However, duodenal ulcers are (almost) never malignant.  Since gastric ulcers may be malignant, you always need to get a biopsy, and follow them until recovery.          You can’t always tell what they are from endoscopy.      Appearance of typical gastric ulcers versus malignant ulcers.  Gastric ulcers typically look punched out, round, with smooth edges, flat margins, and radiating folds.  Malignant ulcers typically are more oval-shaped, irregular edged, with heaped up margins, and folds that do not radiate to the edge.Complications of Peptic Ulcers  These are remembered with the HOPP acronym:          H → Hemorrhage.      O → Obstruction.      P → Penetration.      P → Perforation.        How does penetration differ from perforation?          Performation → goes through the wall of an organ into free space.      Penetration → when the ulcer penetrates into an adjacent organ.      Summary of Peptic Ulcers  Gastric Ulcers and Duodenal Ulcers                             Gastric Ulcers        Duodenal Ulcers                            Cause        Loss of protective factors        Increase in damaging factors                    Most common etiology        NSAID use        H. pylori                    Risk of malignancy?        May actually be an ulcerating cancer        Almost never malignant                    Typical presentation        Any age, male &gt; female.        Older, male = female                    Onset of pain        During a meal        2-3 hours after a meal            Clinical Approach to Peptic Ulcer Disease  Basically just one symptom with Peptic Ulcer Disease → epigastric (burning) pain.  This pain usually differs depending on whether it’s a gastric ulcer or a duodenal ulcer.          GU → during a meal, gastric acid production increases as food enters the stomach.      DU → initial relief with a meal, because the pylorus closes, and acid is not reaching the duodenum.                  When the stomach releases food 2-3 hours after the meal, it’ll get to the duodenum and pain will worsen.                      How do you differentiate GERD from PUD?          Both will typically present with an epigastric burning pain.      GERD will usually be differentiated by the fact that:                  Pain radiates up into the chest.          Worse lying down and with increased intra-abdominal pressure (↑ backflow).          Often has associated regurgitation, and a bad taste.                    With PUD, there’s often:                  History of NSAIDs or positive H. pylori serology.                      Diagnosis:          Upper GI Series (barium swallow) → not invasive, easy access, but no opportunity to biopsy.      Endoscopy → invasive, but more sensitive, and can take biopsies.      Approach to a Young Patient (&lt;40) with a Typical History  Visit 1 → treat with PPI, get HP serology, stop NSAIDs.  Visit 2 (4 weeks later):          If feeling better:                  Serology (+) for HP → eradicate it.          Serology (-) for HP → probably reflux.                    If no improvement → upper GI series/endoscopy.      Approach to an Older Patient (&gt; 40) with typical history      Upper GI Series or endoscopy always → in older patients, there’s a higher risk of malignancy, so imaging is needed.    If there’s a duodenal ulcer:          Eradicate HP, stop NSAIDs.      Can treat presumptive HP even if serology is negative (and the patient has no other pertinent Hx like NSAID use), because the test isn’t 100% sensitive, and because 90% of duodenal ulcers are caused by HP.      PPI for 4-8 weeks.        If there’s a gastric ulcer:          Stop NSAIDs, eradiate HP (if positive).      PPI for 4-8 weeks.      Need a biopsy to rule out malignancy.        Remember      If you have an older patient with a gastric ulcer, then you need to do a biopsy to rule out malignancy.    Duodenal ulcers are almost never malignant.  Tests for Heliobacter pyloriThere are 3 tests for H. pylori.  HP serology          Blood test for antibodies against H. pylori.      80% sensitive.      Since we’re looking for antibodies, will always be positive, even after eradication!      So this can’t be used to monitor response to treatment.        Gastric biopsies          95% sensitive.      Expensive, invasive.        C13 Urea Breath test 	- 95% sensitive.          New modality for diagnosis.      Nuclear medicine scan where you consume urea, and the presence of urease from H. pylori breaks it down into ammonia and, ultimately, CO2.      The carbon in the CO2 is radio-labelled so you can detect the presence of urease.      Common Questions about Peptic Ulcers  Can ECASA 81 mg cause an ulcer?          YES! Particularly in the elderly, with less effective gastric blood flow and mucin protection.        How to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers?          Take the NSAID with food.      Cytoprotection: PPI &gt; H2 antagonist &gt; misoprostol.        Can an NSAID ever be taken again after an ulcer?          YES! But you have to confirm healing, and take a PPI for cytoprotection.      Pharmacology of Acid Lowering Drugs  Classes of medications include:          Proton pump inhibitors:                  Omeprazole (Nexium, the purple pill), Lansoprazole, etc.                    Histamine H2 Antagonists:                  Ranitidine, famotidine, etc.                    Muscarinic M1 Antagonists:                  Pirenzepine.                    Antacids:                  Mg(OH)2, Al(OH)3, etc.                    Cytoprotectants:                  Misoprostol, etc.                    Proton Pump Inhibitors  One of the most commonly prescribed classes of medications.  The ‘__prazole’ drugs.  Chemical class: substituted benzimidazoles.  Mechanism of action: inhibit H+/K+ ATPase on the apical membrane of parietal cells.          These actually bind irreversibly to the enzyme, resulting in profound and long-lasting effects.        Adverse effects: Generally pretty safe.           Constipation, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, flatulence, and exanthema are common symptoms.       With long term use, there may be fundic gland polyposis, osteoporotic fractures, C. difficile infection.      Drug interaction with Plavix (Clopidigrel).      Note: ironically, all PPIs acid labile → easily broken down by acid. So enteric coating is always used.      Histamine H2 antagonists  Recall that histamine plays a key role in parietal cell secretions.  The ‘__tidine’ drugs.          Cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, etc.        So H2 antagonists block this stimulation.  Mechanism of action: competitive inhibition → they’re analogs of histamine.   General adverse effects: headache, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, pruritis, myalgia, skin rashes.   Cimetidine, an early H2 antagonist, has many additional adverse effects.          Cimetidine-specific adverse side effects: binds to androgen receptors to increase prolactin, so it can cause gynecomastia, impotence.      Also binds to Cytochrome P450 enzymes to affect drug metabolism of many other medications.      Similar to 1st generation sedating antihistamines (H1 antagonists), Cimetidine is somewhat good at crossing the blood-brain barrier and causing CNS effects:                  Confusion, somnolence, dizziness.                      Many of these are now available over-the-counter!Muscarinic antagonists  Mechanism of action: blockade of muscarinic receptors, reducing H+ output.  Lack of selectivity (eg. atropine) yields side effects.          We saw atropine in Cholinergic Pharmacology II, as an anti-muscarinic drug.      Recall that it can cause the antimuscarinic toxidrome.      More selective muscarinic antagonists, like Pirenzepine, were developed to ameliorate this somewhat.        Not as effective as PPIs or H2 antagonists.          So no one really uses muscarinic antagonists for Peptic Ulcer Disease!      Only really for historical interest.      Antacids  Mechanism of action: neutralize acid.  There are two types of antacids → systemic and non-systemic.          Systemic antacids have absorbable cations, and are thus capable of producing systemic alkalosis.                  One example is NaHCO3.          Not recommended → systemic alkalosis can affect pH control, and increase the risk of phosphatic kidney stones.                    Non-systemic antacids are poorly absorbed.                  Examples include Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+.          Adverse side effects: Mg2+ is a laxative, Al3+/Ca2+ cause constipation, Al3+ reduces phosphate absorption and bind pepsin, Ca2+ produce acid rebound and bind tetracyclines.          Since Mg causes diarrhea (Mg causes Diarrhea → MD), and Al/Ca are constipating, manufacturers often combine them.                      Milk-alkali syndrome:          When Ca2+ antacids are taken chronically with milk, you may produce hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, calcinosis, azotemia, hypophosphatemia.       Cytoprotectants  ASA and other NSAIDs are ulcerogenic.  Prostaglandins protect the stomach by decreasing acid, pepsin, gastrin; increasin bicarbonate, mucin, mucous .  Misoprostol and Enprostil are prostaglandin analogues, which have much of the same effects.  Side effects: diarrhea, cramps, uterotonic actions, uterine bleeding.          It’s also an abortifacient → Misoprostol can cause abortions!      So it’s (obviously) contraindicated in pregnant women, and it’s also used for chemical abortions.        Remember      Misoprostol (a prostaglandin analogue), can cause abortions.  Bismuth  Eg. Bismuth subsalicylate (medicinal ingredient in Pepto bismol).  Increases mucin production, decreases pepsin secretion, antimicrobial against H. pylori.Treatment of Gastritis and Peptic Ulcer DiseaseReduce Aggressive Factors  Proton-Pump Inhibitors          Omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole.        Histamine H2-Receptor Antagonists are less often used now.          Ranitidine, Famotidine.      H. pylori Eradication  Important.  Remember this as 3-2-1.          3 drugs:                  Amoxicillin (Metronidazole if penicillin allergy).          Clarithromycin.          PPI.                    2 times per day.      1 week        This regimen is &gt;90% effective at eradicating H. pylori.  If eradication fails:          Suggests re-infection or antibiotic resistance.      Then, we either:                  Use longer durations of treatment.          Try quadruple therapy (tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, bismuth).                      Eradicating H. pylori      3 drugs, 2 times per day, 1 week → 321 regimen.    The 3 drugs are:              Amoxicillin (Metronidazole if there’s a penicillin allergy).        Clarithromycin.        Proton Pump Inhibitor.

	{"title": "Anatomy &amp; Histology &ndash; Stomach Mesentery &ndash; Duodenum &amp; Pancreas", "text": "  Sunny: This lecture involves histology and anatomy, and is thus diagram-heavy.      Sandig’s part is mostly pancreas and histology    Johnson’s part also includes abdominal cavity stuff, in addition to the stomach, duodenum, spleen, and pancreas.  Part I: SandigThe Pancreas  Pancreas is a compound alveolar gland → the inside looks like grapes on vines, with a branching duct system (hence “compound”).  Cells of the pancreas include:          Acinar cells secrete inactivated digestive enzymes (i.e. zymogens) → they’re inactivated to avoid digesting the pancreas itself.      Duct cells produce bicarbonate → neutralizes incoming stomach acid in the duodenum.      Low magnification image of the Pancreas  Small intestines with finger-like projections visible  The outermost layer is the muscularis externa  Pancreatic tissue is on the right ← visible islets of Langerhans are shown as pale dots among the purple (mark of pancreatic tissue).Pancreatic TissueEndocrine Pancreas  Lighter stained.  Islet cells:          Alpha islet cells → produce glucagon.      Beta islet cells → produce insulin.      Delta islet cells → produce stomatostatin.        Endocrine glands secrete into the blood streamExocrine Pancreas  Darker stained.  Looks like series of compartments  Serous secretory acini → secrete pancreatic enzymes into intercalated ducts  Exocrine glands secrete into lumen, in this case lumen of ducts  Remember      The endocrine pancreas secretes hormones into the blood stream.    The exocrine pancreas secretes enzymes into the lumen (of ducts).    Islet Cells      Alpha islet cells → produce glucagon.    Beta islet cells → produce insulin.    Delta islet cells → produce stomatostatin.  The Secretory acinus  Secretory cells surround a duct to form a secretory acinus (e.g. upper right red arrow).           Their nuclei orient away from the center (basal nuclei)        Centroacinar cell lie in the centre of the secretory acinus.          Their cytoplasm does not stain well due to lack of secretory function (though they do produce bicarbonate).        Ducts from acini join to form larger ducts, see the intercalated duct label on the slide  Remember: in histological slides, not all acini can be sectioned in the best angle → may not form complete circle, so may not see centroacinar cell.Linking histology to diagrams  Note centroacinar cell (upper left) in histology and both diagrams.  Note acinar secretory cells and intercalated duct in the diagram and compare to previous slide histology.  In the bottom diagram, notice that secretory cells have abundant rough ER for enzyme production and zymogen granules ready to be secreted, while other cells do not,Enzymes of the pancreas  Trypsinogen → breaks down proteins.  Amylase → breaks down sugars (starch and glycogen).  Lipase → breaks down fats.  These are packaged in their inactive form into zymogen granules.          Prevents them from acting willy-nilly.      For example, trypsinogen is the inactivated form of trypsin.        These are then released into the lumen of the secretory acinus.Activation of Pancreatic EnzymesPancreatic enzymes are activated in a cascade, starting with the conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin. This is mediated by glycocalyx-bound enterokinases.  The pancreas produces enzymes in an inactivated form (i.e. zymogens)  The Glycocalyx on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells bind membrane bound enterokinases → these cleave trypsinogen locally, producing trypsin (activated).  Trypsin can then cleave other zymogens → resulting in other activated enzymes.          This produces an enzyme activation cascade on the surface of the enterocyte.      Endocrine cells in small intestines signal to the pancreas and gall bladderWe saw the entero-endocrine cell of the small intestine in Histology of the GI Tract!  Enteroendocrine cells (first diagram, look like triangles) secrete secretin and cholecystokinin into bloodstream (not the lumen) via fenestrated capillaries.  Secretin → stimulates pancreatic ducts to produce bicarbonate.  Cholecystokinin → stimulates pancreatic acini to produce enzymes and causes the gall bladder to contract, releasing bile  Bicarbonate turns acidic chyme (second diagram, acid/food slurry) to neutral product, and also helps create an ideal pH for digestive enzymes  Digestive enzymes continue digestion, and bile helps digestion of fat.  Secretin &amp; Cholecystokinin      Both secretin and cholecystokinin are produced by enteroendocrine cells in the small intestine.              Secretin stimulates bicarbonate production in the pancreas.        Cholecystokinin does many things:                      Stimulates pancreatic acini to produce enzymes.            Stimulates the gallbladder, causing it to release bile.                              Part II: JohnsonThe intraperitoneal cavity  Due to development (review embryology lectures), the intraperitoneal abdominal cavity is separated by mesenteries and organs into two compartments:          Greater sac → entire anterior region (in front of liver, intestines, etc.) and inferior-posterior (gut, but not kidneys - those are retroperitoneal).      Lesser sac → superior-posterior (behind stomach, basically).        Folds of peritoneum become omentums:          The lesser omentum goes from the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and the duodenum. It covers the lesser sac.      The greater omentum hangs off the stomach, folds over the intestines, and attaches to the transverse colon on the other side.        Because these compartments are continuous with each other, infection/irritation/inflammation can travel.           For instance, a pelvic infection that spreads to the subphrenic (under diaphragm) space. This can even present as shoulder pain because they are innervated by the same nerves (C3-5).      Features/spaces of the intraperitoneal cavity  There is actually a connection between the two sacs, located behind the stomach, called the omental foramen.  Subphrenic space → between the underside of the diaphragm, and the top of the liver.          With an irritated diaphragm, a patient may actually present with shoulder pain, since the nerves that innervate the diaphragm (C3,4,5 keeps the diaphragm alive) also innervate the shoulder.        Paracolic gutters → spaces beside the colon on either side.  Hepatorenal recess (Morrison’s recess) → between the liver and kidney.          Fluid collects here when in a supine position, along with the rectovescial recess.        Rectovesical recess (Rectouterine recess) → behind the bladder/uterus.          Fluid also collects here when in a supine position, along with the hepatorenal recess.      Intraperitoneal vs. Retroperitoneal SpacesRecall secondary retroperitoneal structures from   The SADPUCKER Acronym (3=) defines the structures that are retroperitoneal (including secondary retroperitoneal structures):          S → Suprarenal Glands (Adrenals).      A → Aorta and IVC.      D → Duodenum.      P → Pancreas.      U → Ureter.      C → Colon (ascending and descending).      K → Kidney.      E → Esophagus.      R → Rectum.        Intraperitoneal Structures include:          Stomach.      Liver.      Gallbladder.      Spleen.      Jejunum, ileum.      Transverse &amp; sigmoid colon.      Stomach  From superior to inferior:           Fundus → may be elongated in some patients.      Body → can be grossly identified by the presence of rugae (ridged surface), but this is less prominent in children.      Antrum       Pylorus → goes to duodenum.        Greater and lesser curvatures connect to greater and lesser omentum respectively.  Gastroesophageal junction → near top, where esophagus connects to stomach. Connects to area between fundus and body.  Pyloric sphincter near bottom, connect to pylorus.  Innervated by the vagus.  Blood supply:          The two curvatures receive the majority of the blood.      Greater Curvature: gastroepiploic artery.      Lesser Curvature: left and right gastric arteries.      Abdominal Radiographs  Arrows in the top-left image point to paracolic gutters.  For the top-right image:          Note how far the liver has been pushed off from the wall, in the subphrenic space. This is fluid!      The asterisk is at the lesser sac (between the stomach and pancreas), which is also filled with fluid.        If you see gas in a tube, it’s probably the large intestines  Look for:          Leaks → fluid/air in abdominal cavities (e.g. air in subphrenic space shown on CXR ← perforated stomach ulcer).                  Gas in large intestines and stomach is normal.                    Obstruction      Stones/masses      Duodenum  Connects from pylorus of stomach (intraperitoneal) and goes retroperitoneal  Wraps around head of pancreas (also retroperitoneal).      Runs behind superior mesenteric vessels (recall that these were sandwiched by the two embryologic pancreatic buds).    Pokes back into peritoneal cavity at the duodenojejunal flexure.          The duodenum is maintained in this ‘flexed’ position by a ligament called the ligament of Treitz, seen right.      Will be seen later on as a landmark in helping to distinguish upper and lower GI bleeds.       Note that the proximal half arises from the foregut, while the distal half arises from the midgut. This means that there are different blood supplies to the two halves of the duodenum, namely the celiac artery and the SMA respectively.Spleen  Recall that the function of the spleen was to filter the blood.          Hence the spleen is highly vascularized.      Sits in the left-most side of the abdominal cavity, in a very posterior position.      Recall from Blood that the spleen can become enlarged in a number of conditions → splenomegaly.        Lies in the Left hypochondriac region → below ribs  Supplied by the splenic artery from the celiac trunk          The splenic artery enters the lienorenal ligament (connects the spleen to posterior peritoneal wall, behind which is kidney).        Has a hilum that faces medially.  Shouldn’t be able to palpate it during physical exam.  Surfaces:          Gastric.      Colic (left colic flexure).      Renal.      Pancreas (tail).        Size on imaging should be (much) smaller than the liver.PancreasThe Uncinate process is where the two pancreatic buds merged, and sandiwched the superior mesenteric vessels.  Uncinate process, head, neck, body, tail          Head develops from both dorsal and ventral diverticuli, the rest from dorsal only.      The Superior mesenteric artery and vein runs sandwiched between neck (anteriorly) and uncinate process (posteriorly).      They can get compressed if there’s a splenic mass, etc.        The pancreas is retroperitoneal like the duodenum, but unlike the spleen and stomach.  No serosa → easy target for infection/cancer in abdominal cavity          Also hard to identify on a cadaver → look like cottage cheese                  Use the splenic artery as landmark (it has a characteristic winding structure and should be just superior to the pancreas).          The splenic vein runs posterior to the body and tail.

	{"title": "Anatomy &ndash; Anterior Abdominal Wall and Abdominal Cavity", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Use knowledge of surface landmarks, planes, quadrants, regions to determine the position of abdominal viscera and interpret pain presentation.  Use knowledge of inguinal region to diagnose the physical signs &amp; symptoms of inguinal hernias and comment on possible complications that might arise due to anatomy of the area.  Describe the layering of the anterior abdominal wall with respect to fascia, muscles, nerve and blood vessel pathways that need to be considered when making an incision.  Extrapolate the anatomical structures, found on the cadaver and images, to histological, CT and radiographic images in order to interpret clinical findings of a given scenario.Lecture Outline  Regions, surface features and layers of abdominal wall.  Muscles of abdominal wall (lab).  Vasculature and innervation (lab).  Define and describe inguinal region.  Coverings spermatic cord.  Hernias (Assignment and lab).Quadrants, Regions and PlanesQuadrants  There are four abdominal quadrants:          Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ).      Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ).      Right Lower Quadrant. (RLQ).      Left Lower Quadrant. (LLQ).      Regions  There are nine abdominal regions:          Epigastric.      Umbilical.      Suprapubic (hypogastric).      R &amp; L Hypochondriac.      R &amp; L Lumbar.      R &amp; L Inguinal.      Planes  Transpyloric Plane → L1.          Recall that the renal hilum was around here from Genitourinary!      Also crosses the pylorus → of course, it is the transpyloric plane.      The gallbladder, duodenum, and pancreas also come off at this level.      Surface Features of the Anterior Wall  Linea Alba          Attachment of the fascia of the rectus abdominus muscles.      Leaves the vertical ‘line’ down the middle of the 6-pack.        Tendinous Intersections          Also caused by fascial attachments of the rectus abdominus.      These leave the horizontal indentations between each ‘pack’ of the 6-pack.        Linea Semilunaris          Where the muscular wall of the abdominal wall stops, and becomes more fascial.      This is the rounded, half-moon like ‘side’ of each pack of rectus abdominal.        Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (ASIS).          What you put your hand on when you put your hand on your hips.      The anterior part of the iliac crest, where the inguinal ligament and the sartorius muscle attach.        Inguinal Ligament          Ligament that runs from the ASIS to the pubic tubercle.        Costal Margin          Margins of the ribcage.        Umbilicus (L3)          Where the belly-button is.       Should be at the level of the 3rd lumbar vertebrae.      These surface landmarks are useful surgically, because they can be used as incision landmarks.        Remember      L1 → Transpyloric Plane.    L3 → Umbilicus.  Layers of the Abdominal WallRight under the skin, we have 2 layers of superficial fascia.  Camper’s Fascia → the fatty, soft layer of fascia.          Covers everything under the skin, sort of like putting on a wet-suit.      In the lab, Camper’s fascia is very difficult to delineate, because when the cadavers get embalmed, you lose lots of the delineation.        Scarpa’s Fascia → the membranous fascia that can hold stitches.          Traditionally has been thought to only exist in the lower anterior abdominal region.      So it’s like wearing a thong!         Colle’s (Darto’s) Fascia          Scarpa’s fascia is continuous with the fascia of the perineum.      So Scarpa’s fascia merges and blends into Colle’s Fascia, also known as Darto’s fascia, which is the fascia lining the perineum.      So if a man had a urethral injury, it could spread up the abdominal wall, because the fascial layers are continuous!        Fascia of the Abdominal Wall      Camper’s Fascia → fatty, soft, lines everything.    Scarpa’s Fascia → thin, membranous (can put stitches through it), localized only to the lower anterior abdominal wall.    Colle’s Fascia → the fascia surrounding the perineum. Continuous with Scarpa’s fascia.  Abdominal Musculature  Note the linea alba in the middle, with rectus abdominus muscle on either side.  Also note that there are fewer tendinous intersections lower down the rectus abdominis.           This is why it’s often harder to obtain ‘definition’ lower in your abs!      It’s also why you can easily get fat down there.      Also, exercising the lower abdominal muscles requires lifting the legs, not doing crunches, which are what most people think of when working out their abs.This is what we saw with the intercostal muscles as well!        The outermost external oblique has fibres that run downwards → hands in pockets.  Second is the internal oblique, which has fibres that run upwards → giving yourself a hug.  The innermost transversus abdominus muscle has fibres that run transversely (horizontally).By having these muscles run in different directions, your collective abdominal strength is much higher.  Layers of Abdominal Musculature      Superficially to deeply, we have:              External Oblique → fibres run downwards (hands in pocket).        Internal Oblique → fibres run upwards (personal hug).        Transversus Abdominus → fibres run transversely.              To get a better look at this, look at the plates from Anatomy Lab – Anterior Abdominal Wall  It’s called an aponeurosis because it’s a wider sheet of fascia.  There’s a thick layer of fascia that covers the rectus abdominus → the aponeurosis of the external oblique.          The external oblique stops becoming muscle around the linea semiluminaris, and becomes this aponeurosis.      This aponeurosis also folds upon itself at its inferior margin, forming the inguinal ligament.      There’s a natural opening in this inguinal ligament, which is referred to as the superficial inguinal ring.                  The spermatic cord travels through this ring in males.          The round ligament of the uterus travels through this in females.                     The Rectus Sheath  The rectus sheath is a lining that surrounds the rectus abdominis muscles.          Anteriorly, the sheath is formed by the external and internal oblique aponeuroses.      Posteriorly, the sheath is formed by the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, and the transversus abdominis.      The internal oblique aponeurosis actually splits into two lamellae – one of which travels in front of the rectus, and one of which travels behind.        If you follow the posterior sheath down, you’ll notice that it stops part-way, at a point called the arcuate line.          Below the arcuate line, the posterior sheath stops, and you only have a very thin layer of fascia called the transversalis fascia.      This is important surgically, because when you make an incision below the arcuate line, you have to be careful when you pass the rectus sheath, since there’s no fascia there.        Remember      The posterior sheath stops at the arcuate line!    Below this, all you have is transversalis fascia.  Nerve &amp; Blood SupplyArteries  There are two main arteries that feed the abdominal wall:          Superior epigastric (from the internal thoracic), comes down from the top.      Inferior epigastric (from the external iliac), comes up from the bottom.        These two blood vessels anastamose.  The inferior epigastric is the main blood supply.          It can actually be an important collateral circulation when the abdominal aorta is occluded.        Remember      The abdominal wall is fed by the superior epigastric from above, and the inferior epigastric from below. These two blood vessels anastamose.    The inferior epigastric is the main blood supply.    The inferior epigastric vessels actually enter into the posterior rectus sheath through the arcuate line.          So the arcuate line is also important for landmarking it.        These vessels are also used as a landmark for the deep inguinal ring.Here we're looking at the abdominal wall from behind, and looking at how the inferior epigastric enters the posterior rectus sheath at the arcuate line.Nerves  The nerves of the upper abdominal wall come out segmentally, similarly to the intercostal nerves.          These are referred to as the thoracoabdominal nerves, and they come off of T7-T9.      There is also a subcostal nerve at T12.      These nerves enter the rectus sheath.        The umbilicus is at L3 vertebrally, but dermatomally, it’s at T10.  The nerves of the lower abdominal wall, include the:          Iliohypogastric nerve (L1).                  Doesn’t enter the rectus sheath, and is suprapubic.                    Ilioinguinal nerve (L1).                  Enters the superficial inguinal ring, which, as we recall, was a fold in the aponeurosis of the external oblique.                      Remember  The umbilicus is at the:      T10 dermatome level.    L3 vertebral level.  The Inguinal Region  The inguinal ligament goes from the ASIS to the pubic tubercle.  The superficial inguinal ring opens by the pubic tubercle.  The deep inguinal ring is around halfway between the the two.          It can be landmarked by finding it just lateral to the inferior epigastric artery.        The inguinal canal runs from the deep ring to the superficial ring.          It contains the spermatic cord in males, and the round ligament in females.      The ilioinguinal nerve also passes through this, so it has to be carefully preserved during hernia repair.      Formation of the Inguinal Canal  The inguinal canal is a tube with different components comprising its walls:          The (aponeurosis of the) external oblique acts as the anterior wall.      The internal oblique acts as the roof.      The transversus abdominus and the transversalis fascia act as the roof and posterior wall.      Part of the inguinal ligament forms the floor.        Arching fibres of ‘TIE’ serve to keep the contents of the inguinal canal in place:          T → transversus abdominus.      I → internal oblique.      E → external oblique.        The parietal peritoneum will form a pouch that follows the track of the testes, which is the processus vaginalis.          As we develop, the opening of the processus vaginalis seals up, preventing any organs from passing through it.      If this fails to seal, you can end up with a congenital hernia.      The peritoneum that remains wrapped around the testes becomes the tunica vaginalis.        Because the testes pull abdominal muscles and peritoneum down as they descend, we end up with a number of structures:          The aponeurosis of the external oblique becomes the external spermatic fascia.      The internal oblique becomes the cremaster muscle/fascia.      The transversalis fascia becomes the internal spermatic fascia.      The remaining parietal peritoneum wrapped around the testes becomes the tunica vaginalis.        Abdominal/Inguinal Equivalents                    Abdominal Structure        Inguinal Equivalent                            External Oblique        External spermatic fascia                    Internal Oblique        Cremaster muscle/fascia                    Transversalis Fascia        Internal spermatic fascia                    Parietal Peritoneum        Tunica vaginalis            Hernia Types  An inguinal hernia can either be direct or indirect.          Direct hernias → where the hernia directly breaks through a weak point in the fascia of the abdominal wall, typically near the superficial inguinal ring.      Indirect hernia → when the hernia actually goes through the inguinal canal (it enters the deep inguinal ring, and exits at the superficial inguinal ring).        A good summary is listed below:  Direct vs. Indirect Hernias                    Indirect Hernia        Direct Hernia                            Originates at the deep inguinal ring        Originates at the superficial inguinal ring                    Usually associated with patent processus vaginalis        Usually associated with a weak superficial ring and/or weak conjoint tendon                    Passes through the inguinal canal        Does not pass through the inguinal canal                    Usually exits to scrotum at the superficial inguinal ring        Bulges at the superficial ring and rarely enters the scrotum                    Herniation is lateral to the inferior epigastric artery        Herniation is medial to the inferior epigastric artery              These two can often be differentiated clinically by looking at their location relative to Hesselbach’s triangle.  Hesselbach’s triangle is formed by 3 structures:          Medial border: The lateral margin of the rectus sheath (the linea semilunaris).      Superolateral border: Inferior epigastric vessels.      Inferior border: The inguinal ligament.        Indirect hernias enter at the deep inguinal ring, which is lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, they occur outside Hesselbach’s triangle.  Direct hernias on the other hand typically occur at the superficial inguinal ring, which is inside Hesselbach’s triangle.  Hesselbach’s Triangle      Medial border: linea semilunaris.    Superolateral border: inferior epigastric vessels.    Inferior border: inguinal ligament.

Dysphagia &amp; Motility DisordersEsophagitis  Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus) can be caused by:          GERD → by far the most common.      Eosinophilic.      Infections → Candida, HIV, CMV.  Recall that kayexelate was a potassium-binding resin that’s sometimes used when dealing with hyperkalemia.      Drugs → NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, iron, kayexelate.      Chemical.      Physical.      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)  GERD = most common cause of esophagitis.  injury due to acid/pepsin/bile reflux into the esophageal lining causing damage  Damages the mucosa of the esophagus.What prevents GERD?  A competent lower esophageal sphincter is the big one.          Factors that can affect this, by lowering the LES pressure, include:                  Diet → alcohol, chocolate, peppermint, fatty foods.          Drugs → relaxants like calcium-channel blockers, and benzodiazepines.          Smoking          Pregnancy → either due to hormonal changes, or just increases in abdominal pressure.          Hiatal Hernia.                      Efficient esophageal clearance (normal peristalsis)  Normal gastric emptying  Mucosal integrity  If any of these mechanisms are faulty, then GERD can occur.  What is a Hiatal Hernia?    Hiatal Hernia → when the stomach ends up moving out of the abdominal cavity through the esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm.      Sliding Hiatal Hernia → the stomach gets pulled up through the esophageal hiatus.    Paraesophageal Hiatal Hernia → the stomach prolapses alongside the esophagus through the esophageal hiatus.  GERD Symptoms  Heartburn → retrosternal burning pain.          Post-prandial pain → after eating.      relieved with antacids → gravity doesn’t help keep things down anymore.      aggravated by lying down.        Regurgitation → spontaneous vomit.  Atypical chest pain → ‘non-cardiac chest pain’.  Signs of gastric contents affecting other parts of the body:          Dental erosions      Cough, pharyngitis.        When these are mild and infrequent, then it’s not serious → it happens all the time in the general population.          GERD is common, but most is mild, and isn’t treated.      Those with more moderate symptoms seen by FPs.      Those with severe symptoms seen by gastroenterologists.      Diagnosing GERD  Diagnostic tests are often not necessary → the diagnosis can usually be made by the history.  A physical exam can be done to exclude other illnesses.  Other tests include:          Barium swallow to assess anatomy (see other lectures).      Esophageal manometry can be done to assess LES pressure and competence.      pH monitoring studies → an acidic esophagus indicates reflux.        To assess complications, do an upper GI endoscopy, with biopsy.What are these Complications?  Hemorrhage (acute and chronic).  Repeated damage → fibrosis → stricture.  Barrett’s esophagus (repeated damage).          This is the most worrisome complication of GERD, because it can lead to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.      Primary adenocarcinoma is the most common esophageal malignancy.      Barrett’s Esophagus  Barrett’s Esophagus is a complication from long-term esophageal damage from GERD.          It’s defined as the replacement of normal squamous mucosa by columnar epithelium containing goblet cells.      In other words, the esophagus undergoes metaplasia to more closely resemble intestinal cells.      Physiologically, this is a adaptive response to an acidic esophageal milieu.         Seen in 10% of patients with symptomatic GERD.  Barrett’s is the biggest predisposing factor for the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.          Increases your risk by 30-fold.        Barrett’s Esophagus      Barrett’s Esophagus is the replacement of squamous mucosa with columnar epithelium.    In other words, the esophagus undergoes intestinal metaplasia.    It’s the biggest predisposing factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma!  Management of GERD/Barrett’s Esophagus  Treatment can either be done via a step-up approach, or a step-down approach.          Step-up → start with the weakest treatments, and work your way up to stronger treatments (until the issue is resolved).      Step-down → start with a strong treatment, and back off once symptoms have been controlled.        Along these lines, possible treatments for GERD/Barrett’s, in order from least potent to most potent, are:          Lifestyle Modification                  This should be added to the treatment of any patient with GERD/smoking.          Elevate head of bed, lets gravity assist your esophageal sphincter.          Dietary modification, lower fatty foods, chocolate, alcohol.          Weight loss, stop smoking.          Discontinue medications that weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, i.e. benzos, CCBs.                    Pharmacological Therapy                  These are the antacids, and are used more for patients with predictable, frequent symptoms.          H2 Antagonists → ranitidine, famotidine.                          Less effective that PPIs, but also fewer side effects.                                Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) → ‘prazole’ drugs.                           Omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, etc.              Largely superseded H2 antagonists.              These will treat &gt;90% of all patients with GERD, so physicians are increasingly starting with these (as a step-down approach).                                Prokinetics → domperidone.                          These improve GI tract motility and gastric emptying.              But there are risks of cardiac side-effects with any drug that’s strong enough to affect motility → domperidone has a black-box warning about potential arrhythmias.                                          Surgery                  Nissen Fundoplication.                          For patients refractory to pharmacological treatment.              Reflux is improved by wrapping the fundus of the stomach around the LES, to create a high-pressure zone (see below).                                            When do you Endoscope a Patient?            We mentioned that GERD is usually diagnosed by history, but there are obviously cases where endoscopy is needed, namely when screening for Barrett’s esophagus.      With Barrett’s, the disease progression to adenocarcinoma is:                  Metaplasia → low grade dysplasia → high grade dysplasia → adenocarcinoma.                    Anyone middle aged individual requiring daily medication for GERD should undergo endoscopic screening.       Other Causes of Esophagitis  Eosinophilic esophagitis.  Infections → candida, HSV, CMV, HIV.  Drugs → NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, antibiotics, iron, kayexalate.  Chemicals → lye, acid.  Physical → radiation, NG tubes.Eosinophilic esophagitis  Seen as in patients with asthma, very common cause of esophagitis among younger patients.  Upon endoscope, shows vertical furrows, corrugated rings.  Upon microscopic pathology, squamous tissue is filled with eosinophils.Candida Esophagitis  Seen most often in patients that are immunocompromised.  Upon endoscope, can see candida plaques  microscopic pathology shows pseudo hyphaeDysphagia &amp; Motility Disorders  After GERD/Barrett’s, the next most important thing when diagnosing esophageal disorders is to have an approach to dysphagia.  Dysphagia → difficulty swallowing.  Dysphagia can have an oropharyngeal etiology, or an esophageal etiology.          Oropharyngeal → the transfer of food from the mouth into the esophagus.                  Oropharnygeal dysphagia is usually due to some sort of neuromuscular problem.                    Esophageal → the transfer of food down the esophagus to the stomach.      You can differentiate between these two by asking where do things stick?                  If it’s oropharyngeal, then they usually point to the Adam’s apple or above.          If it’s esophageal, then they usually point to the sternal notch or below.                      Clinical Note      Patients will point to where they feel food gets stuck, but The actual pathology can be anywhere downstream from where they point.    One example is with achalasia, where loss of peristalsis at the bottom of the esophagus causes a swallowing dysfunction.    You can then diagnose esophageal dysphagia with 3 questions:          Solid or Solid/Liquid                  This helps you determine if it’s a mechanical problem or a motility problem.          Solid → mechanical problem.          Solid/liquid → motility problem.          These make sense → if your GI tract can’t move anything, then you’ll have issues with both solids or liquids, but if it’s an obstruction, then liquids should be able to sneak through.          For instance, if there’s a problem with how we coordinate movement down the GI tract, then it’s more                     Progressive or Intermittent                  Some things won’t spontaneously get better (eg a tumour).          Other things may fluctuate (eg. an allergy).                    Associated Symptoms                  For instance, the presence/absence of heartburn.          With a tumour, you would be looking at potential B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss).          For more, see below.                      An Approach to Dysphagia  Esophageal Motility DisordersThe esophageal motility disorders can be classified as primary or secondary.  Primary Causes:          Achalasia.      Diffuse esophageal spasm (chest pain)      Nutcracker esophagus (odynophagia)      Hypertensive LES.      non‐specific esophageal motor disorder        Secondary Causes:          Connective tissue disorders (Scleroderma, CREST syndrome) → the only clinically important secondary cause of dysmotility. The others are very minor.      Diabetes mellitus.      Alchohol abuse.      Neurologic disorders → can affect both the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing as well as the esophageal phase.      Diagnosis of Esophageal Disorders  A barium swallow, also known as an upper GI series, is the best screening tool for dysphagia, because it looks at both anatomy and function of the esophagus.          Note: Upon radiology, peptic strictures look very geometric, while malignant structures are more convoluted or asymmetric.        Schatzki’s Ring → a radiological finding, where you have a 2-3 mm mucosal ring, showing as narrowing.          Easily fixed by dilation.      1. Primary Esophageal Disorder: Achalasia  Achalasia is where the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax, for some reason.          Leads to a predictable and progressive dysphagia.        This acts as a functional obstruction, resulting in a loss of peristalsis at the bottom of the esophagus.  The esophagus becomes an inappropriate reservoir.  Diagnosis          Manometry will show high pressure at level of LES      Will also often see a classic bird’s beak esophagus with a barium swallow.        Treatment (from less severe to most severe)          Smooth muscle relaxants.       Balloon dilatation or Botox.      Surgical myotomy (cut the sphincter laparoscopically).      2. Primary Esophageal Disorder: Diffuse Esophgeal Spasm  Diffuse Esophageal Spasm → is where the entire esophagus has simultaneous prolonged contractions.  Atypical chest pain → Has cardiac-like chest pain (central, squeezing), but all their cardiac tests come back normal.  Intermittent and unpredictable dysphagia, unlike achalasia, which is progressive and predictable.  Diagnosis:          Manometry shows unpredictable spasms which prevent peristalsis.      May also see a rosary-bead esophagus or a cork-screw esophagus radiologically.        Treatment → Reassurance and smooth muscle relaxants.3. Primary Esophageal Disorder: Nutcracker Esophagus  Nutcracker esophagus is characterized by high amplitude, peristaltic contractions.          This differs from diffuse esophageal spasm in that these contractions are still peristaltic.      So the esophagus is basically working normally, except in a way that’s too powerful.        Contractions are so powerful that swallowing becomes painful (odynophagia).  Will also present with atypical chest pain.  Treatment → Reassurance and smooth muscle relaxants.4. Secondary Esophageal Disorder: Scleroderma Esophagus  Scleroderma, a connective tissue disease that causes hardening of the skin, does two things to the esophagus:          Makes the LES hypotensive.      Affects smooth muscle peristalsis, so you lose your mechanical defense mechanism for acid reflux.        As a result, you get severe, complicated, GERD.  Diagnosis → Manometry shows little pressure at LES.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/03/medicine-pathology-esophageal-disorders.html"},
	{"title": "Physiology &amp; Pathophysiology of Motility", "text": "  Lecture Notes      See Physiology &amp; Pathophysiology of Motility Notes.  General ConceptsFunctions of Motility  Propulsion from oral to anal.  Mixing → mechanical dispersion, increase contact with digestive secretions and absorbing cells.  Reservoir/storage → stomach, gallbladder and colon.Clinical GI Motility ProblemsAchalasia—Greek for ‘no relaxation’—is where the esophageal sphincter is unable to relax, preventing food from reaching the stomach.  Motility is important → problems with motility can cause issues anywhere in the GI tract:          Esophagus → GERD, esophageal spasm, and achalasia.      Stomach → gastroparesis, dumping syndrome, functional dyspepsia.      Small bowel → diarrhea, bacterial overgrowth.      Large bowel → constipation, IBS.      Anus → fecal incontinence.      Generalized GI → pseudoobstruction, diabetes and CT disorders (scleroderma).      Control of GI Motility  Control of GI motility is a complex and multi-faceted process.  There are multiple levels of control:          CNS (brain and spinal cord)                  Top level control.          For instance, motility changes when you’re prepping for an exam, or running a marathon.                    Enteric NS (myenteric plexus)                  Composed of Myenteric plexuses, also known as Auerbach Plexuses, which we saw last lecture.          The GI tract has its own ‘brain’.          There are actually more neurons in the GI tract than in the spinal cord!          This allows most of the patterns of motility to exist independent of the brain.          This is why your gut still works when you’re in a vegetative state.                    Myogenic (unique smooth muscle)                  Some GI motility behaviour is pre-programmed in the muscle itself, just like with cardiac muscle!                    Hormonal (endocrine and paracrine)       Luminal contents                  The stuff in the gut plays a role as well!          For instance, if you have too much acid in the duodenum, it will signal the stomach to slow down gastric emptying.                    Smooth MuscleAborally → away from the mouth.  Smooth muscle is innervated by the enteric nervous system, but it also has an intrinsic activity.          Muscle fibres exhibit a slow wave (spontaneous variations in membrane potential), that propagates aborally.      These slow waves are independent of innervation → they’re part of the muscle.      Interstitial cells of Cajal  Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are specialized cells found in the smooth muscle of the GI tract.          They attach to the outside of smooth muscle cells, and act like a pacemaker to set the rate of depolarization and coordinate the slow wave between smooth muscle cells.      This way, instead of having several independent smooth muscle membrane potentials, they’re coordinated together.      So they play an important role in the generation of the slow wave electrical activity.        ICCs also mediate a phase lag, where the downstream smooth muscle is slightly delayed in depolarizing, so that we produce propagated contractions.Physiology of ContractionsThis is conceptually similar to how hyperkalemia raises the cardiac membrane potential, increasing the risk for arrythmias.  Note that the slow waves don’t produce contractions themselves.          Rather, they bring the membrane potential to a level where it can be more easily stimulated.        Spike potentials are what trigger contractions, via cholinergic (parasympathetic) stimulation.          These spike potentials are inhibited by sympathetic stimulation → this makes sense, since you don’t want to be digesting food when your flight-or-flight response is active.        Slow waves dictate the timing and maximum frequency of contractions (by dictating when the membrane is closest to the threshold potential).  Remember      Slow waves dictate the timing and frequency of contractions.    Spike potentials dictate the triggering of the contractions themselves.  This image demonstrates the concept. Note that you can have slow waves without depolarizations when there isn't parasympathetic stimulation. Conversely, parasympathetic stimulation by itself is insufficient for triggering depolarization without the help of a slow wave. You require spike potentials in conjunction with a slow wave to lead to contraction.Patterns of GI Muscle Contractions  Tonic Contraction → sustained contraction, seen with sphincters.  Peristaltic Waves → propagated rings of contraction moving aborally.  Segmental Contraction → stationary ring of contraction to brake contents, and allow them to mix.           This is like ‘kneading a sausage’ → random, unpropagated rings of contraction that mix contents back and forth.      Sphincters in the GI System  The GI tract is divided into functional subdivisions by sphincters.  These act as valves to regulate forward flow, and prevent backwards flow.  These are muscular high pressure zones:          They relax to allow aboral flow.      They contract to prevent retrograde flow.        The GI sphincters include:          Upper esophageal sphincter → between the pharynx and the esophagus.      Lower esophageal sphincter → between the esophagus and stomach.      Pylotic sphincter → between the stomach and duodenum.      Sphincter of Oddi → separating the common bile duct and the duodenum.      Ileocecal Valve → between the small intestine and the colon.      Internal Anal Sphincter.      External Anal Sphincter.        Throughout most of the GI tract, the pressure is low.  However, at the regions of the sphincter, you have endogenously high contraction pressures → they are tonically contracted.  The sphincter is designed in a way that mediates aboral flow:          If the sphincter distends proximally, then the sphincter relaxes, allowing stuff to pass though.      If the sphincter distends distally, then the sphincter tightens, preventing stuff from coming back up.      The EsophagusEsophageal Functional Anatomy  The esophagus is the junction between the striated muscle of the throat, and the smooth muscle of the rest of the GI tract.          Proximally, the esophagus is striated muscle, just like the throat.      Distally, the esophagus is smooth muscle, just like the rest of the GI tract.        This is important with regards to innervation:          The striated muscle component of the esophagus is under central nervous system control.      The smooth muscle component of the esophagus is under enteric nervous system control.        That’s why when you have a stroke, you may have trouble swallowing, but the rest of your digestion behaves normally.  Peristalsis has two phases, triggered by different inputs:          Swallowing induces primary peristalsis.      Distension induces secondary peristalsis.        Remember      The proximal esophagus is composed of striated muscle, and is innervated by the CNS.    The distal esophagus is composed of smooth muscle, and is innervated by the ENS.  Neural Control of the Esophagus  CNS input to the esophagus is via the vagus nerve.          In the striated muscle component of the esophagus, the vagus nerve innervates the muscle directly.      In the smooth muscle component of the esophagus, the vagal nerves feed into enteric plexuses, and relay CNS signals to the enteric nervous system.        Hence, the vagus nerve directly stimulates the esophageal striated muscle, and indirectly regulates the esophageal smooth muscle (via the enteric nervous system).Control of Esophageal Motility  CNS → Central nervous system.          Triggering of swallowing via the swallowing centre.      Signals from the brain are transmitted via the vagus nerve.        ENS → Enteric nervous system.          Regulates pre-patterned peristalsis.        LES → Lower esophageal sphincter.          Multiple control factors, including neural, myogenic, hormonal, and dietary factors.      Incompetence leads to GERD (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease).      Failure to relax leads to Achalasia.        Remember      An LES that’s incompetent leads to GERD.    An LES that fails to relax leads to achalasia.  The Stomach  The stomach has 3 functions with regards to motility:          Storage (accomodation).      Mixing and grinding.      Emptying (propulsion).        If the stomach fails to empty on time, you can have delayed gastric emptying.  Some causes of delayed gastric emptying includes:          Diabetic Gastroparesis (caused by autonomic neuropathies due to diabetes).      Connective Tissue Disorders (eg. scleroderma).      Post gastric surgery (eg. when there’s a vagotomy).                  In the past, when we had poorer treatments for peptic ulcer disease, vagotomies were used often as a treatment.          By cutting branches of the vagus nerve, you reduce parasympathetic innervation to the stomach, resulting in the production of less acid.                    Stomach Functional Anatomy  Functionally, the stomach can be divided into two components:          Orad Stomach → including the fundus and proximal body.                  This acts as a reservoir, and distends with gastric content.                    Caudad Stomach → including the antrum and distal body.                  This area acts to ‘grind and pump’ gastric content.                    Control of Gastric Motility  Receptive Relaxation → vagal reflexes allow the stomach to accomodate more content without an increase in pressure.          Patients who have a vagotomy have a dumping syndrome.      This is because the patient can no longer accomodate extra contents in the stomach, so it just dumps everything into the duodenum, overwhelming it.        Gastric Contractions → coordinated gastric contractions are mediated by a gastric pacemaker, just like in the heart.          This gastric pacemaker is a dense region of Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICCs), located at the greater curvature of the stomach.      If you make a transverse incision through this area, you can actually make another region of the GI tract become the pacemaker, much like what we saw in Heart &amp; Circulation        Gastric Emptying → the rate of gastric emptying is determined by a combination of factors, including pH, osmolarity, fat, and protein content.          One example is that low stomach pH is sensed by receptors, slowing gastric emptying into the duodenum, preventing it from being overwhelmed with acid.      The gastric pacemaker of the stomach.The Small Bowel  Motility in the small bowel is designed to maximize absorption.          Lots of mixing (to mix contents with secretion)      Lots of circulation too (to increase contact with absorptive cells)      Propulsion occurs in a controlled fashion so that there’s still forward movement.        Intestinal contractions may be (1) propagated or (2) localized, as seen above.          Localized contractions act to mix the contents.      Propagated contractions act to move the contents forward.        So we have intervals of mixing and circulation, along with short segments of peristaltic activity in order to slowly bring food through the small bowel.  There is a special behaviour specific to the stomach and small bowel known as the Migrating Myoelectric Complex (MMC), also known as the inter-digestive cycle.          This is a special activity that’s used to maintain the cleanliness of the small bowel.      Normally, after you eat, you have a ‘fed’ motor activity, which slowly moves content through the small bowel in a way that maximizes absorption.      However, when you fast for more than 6 hours, this transitions into a ‘fasting’ motor activity → the migrating myoelectric complex.                  With the MMC, you have coordinated waves of peristalsis that rapidly sweep everything out of the bowel.          This clears out undigested material, leftover food, and bacteria.                    So the MMC acts as a housekeeper, making sure the bowel stays clean.        Remember      We have a ‘fed’ motor activity and a ‘fasting’ motor activity in the bowel.              The ‘fed’ motor activity maximizes absorption.        The ‘fasting’ motor activity (the MMC) cleans up the bowel.            Here we see progression of the MMC over time. Note the rapid spike potentials that fire when the MMC is occurring.The Colon  The colon mainly functions as a reservoir, and to extract water and electrolytes.  Most of the activity in the colon is in the form of segmental contractions, rather than propagated contractions.          This is to maximize absorption of water, and to solidify the stool.        Interspersed with these segmental contractions are short propagated contractions that move the contents slowly down.  Occassionally, we have mass movements → sweeping waves of propagated contraction down to the rectum.          This triggers the urge to take a shit!      Distension of the GI tract usually cannot be sensed until it has reached the rectum, so you don’t really feel the urge until this has happened.      This diagram illustrates the 3 types of contraction patterns in the colon &rarr; (1), the mixing caused by segmental contractions, (2), the short propagated contractions that slowly push the colonic contents along, and (3), mass movements that push everything down to the rectum, ready to be pooped out!The Anus  We have two anal sphincters          Internal Anal Sphincter                  This is smooth muscle.          Involuntary control → this automatically contracts to prevent ‘leaking’.                    External Anal Sphincter                  This is striated muscle.          Voluntary control → this is what you use to prevent yourself from shitting your pants while you run to the toilet!                      These two sphincters are critical in maintaining continence.  If something is wrong with them, you can have fecal incontinence.          This can be myogenic → eg. obstetric misadventures (tears), or post-hemorrhoidectomy.      These can also be neurogenic →. eg. diabetic neuropathy, cauda equina syndrome.        Remember      We have 2 anal sphincters              Internal Anal Sphincter → smooth muscle, under involuntary control.        External Anal Sphincter → striated muscle, under voluntary control.

	{"title": "Anatomy, Histology &amp; Embryology of the Esophagus &amp; Congenital Abnormalities", "text": "  Anatomy &amp; Embryology of the Esophagus Notes      See Anatomy &amp; Embryology of the Esophagus Notes.  Anatomy, Histology &amp; EmbryologyTake Home Points  Foregut structure develops with an associated respiratory diverticulum, therefore respiratory anomalies may be associated with esophagus development.  Muscular tube of skeletal muscle that changes to smooth muscle in mid-third, reflecting function.  Covered in non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.  Innervation and blood supply varies along course.  Closely related to the descending aorta, left atrium, left recurrent laryngeal nerve, thoracic duct, azygos vein, bifurcation of trachea and vertebral column.  Pathologies of these neighbouring structures may show as constrictions of the esophagus.  Case Example      Presents to the ER with dyspnea and dysphagia.    Dysphagia has increased over past six months, has lost 30 pounds    Dyspnea for 3 months; coughing produces blood-tinged sputum.    Last few weeks he has become quite hoarse and has a painful swelling over the right clavicle.    Examination        Patient is distressed and emaciated.    Laryngoscopy shows left vocal fold is abducted.              This is suggestive of left RLN compression.              CXR → partial destruction of the right clavicle.    Fluoroscopy shows an obstruction at the level of the tracheal bifurcation.    Recall that RLN compression could cause dysphagia.          The left RLN branches around the aortic arch.      The right RLN branches around the right subclavian.        Recall that adjacent to the trachea and the bronchi are lymphatic chains that can easily be enlarged.Embryology of the EsophagusA diverticulum is an outpouching from a hollow, or fluid-filled, structure..  The esophagus is lined by endoderm, and is surrounded by mesoderm, which forms the muscular outer wall.  The respiratory diverticulum and the foregut are originally conjoined.  They separate, forming an esophagotracheal septum, around week 4.  If this doesn’t happen, you can have inappropriate communication between the trachea and the esophagus.          This is a tracheal esophageal fistula, and it’ll be seen in the second half of this lecture.      Position of the Esophagus in the Mediastinum  The esophagus passes through the thoracic inlet in between the vertebral column and trachea, from C6 → T10.          In other words, anteriorly to posteriorly, you have the trachea → esophagus → vertebral column.      It’s sandwiched between the trachea and vertebral column!        It starts to the right of the aorta, but moves anterior to it as it descents.  It passes through an opening in the diaphragm at T10 → the esophageal hiatus.          Recall this from Anatomy of the Retroperitoneum.      We saw that there were 3 openings in the diaphragm:                  The caval opening → T8.          The esophageal opening → T10.          The aortic opening → T12.                    Esophageal Hiatus → The opening in the diaphragm, letting the esophagus through.      The right crus of the diaphragm forms a muscular sphincter-like sling, preventing backflow.      This sphincter isn’t particularly strong, because gravity itself prevents backflow.      Other Relationships  The left recurrent nerve lies between the esophagus and the trachea.          So compression between the esophagus and the trachea could result in hoarseness.        Separated from the vertebral column by the thoracic duct, azygos, hemiazygos, &amp; aorta.  Crossed by the left bronchus, aortic arch, and subclavian artery.Constrictions  There are several regions where the esophagus can be constricted by other systems.          At the origin of the cricoid cartilate.      When it’s crossed by the cartilaginous left main bronchus.      When it passes behind the left atrium.      When it enters the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus.      Thoracic Cross-sectionFeatures of the Esophagus  The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube, from C6-T10.  There are 2 layers of muscle running perpendicularly to one another:          Inner circular layer.      Outer longitudinal layer.        This is similar to the ureter, except that with the ureter, you have an inner longitudinal layer, and an outer circular layer.  The muscular composition of the esophagus changes as you go down:          The superior third is skeletal.      The middle third is mixed.      The inferior third is smooth.        In other words, as you go down the esophagus, it changes from a skeletal muscle composition to a smooth muscle composition (which makes sense, since most of the GI tract is smooth muscle).          As we mentioned before, this makes sense functionally.      The top skeletal component can be controlled voluntarily via the CNS with swallowing.      The bottom smooth component can be regulated with the rest of the enteric nervous system.        This CNS innervation is parasympathetic, via the vagus.Blood Supply  Upper → Inferior thyroid artery &amp; vein.  Middle → Esophageal branches from the aorta, venous drainage into the azygos  Lower → left gastric and inferior phrenic arteries and veins.Innervation  Upper → somatic via the RLN (off the vagus).  Middle/lower → autonomic.Histology of the Esophagus  Recall from yesterday, that there were 4 layers of tissue in the GI tract:          Mucosa.      Submucosa.      Muscularis Externae.      Adventitia        Characteristics of each of these in the esophagus are as follows:          Mucosa.                  Stratified squamous cells.          Prominent muscularis mucosa (recall that this was the thin layer of muscle separating the mucosa and submucosa).          Typically these cells are non-keratinized, although in heavy smokers, they can become keratinized as a protective mechanism.                    Submucosa.                  Mucous glands are here, that lubricate the mucosa.                    Muscularis Externa.      Adventitia.                  Loose connective tissue.          No serosa → no membrane lining that encloses it.          Since there’s no serosa, this means that it can be easily invaded from other tissues. So they’re vulnerable to the spread of infection, for instance.                    Junction Regions  Between the esophagus and stomach, you have a junction where the cell type changes.          The esophagus has stratified squamous cells.      The stomach has simple columnar cells.        Stomach cells are also more heavily covered with mucous, thanks to the mucin producing cells we saw yesterday (surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells).  Case Continued    The patient died and an autopsy revealed a large cauliflower-like tumor obstructing the lumen of the esophagus.The mass had perforated the trachea and surrounded and compressed it.  The left recurrent laryngeal nerve was embedded in the mass. The mediastinal lymph nodes were greatly enlarged and adherent. Both lungs showed signs of scattered nodular metastases. The liver also had round tumors. The destruction of the right clavicle also was found to be cancerous metastasis.Congenital Abnormalities of the Esophagus  We’ll be focusing on two congenital esophageal anomalies:          Esophageal Atresia.      Esophageal Duplication Cyst.      1. Esophageal Atresia  Esophageal Atresia (EA).          Atresia → discontinuity.      Hence, esophageal atresia is where the esophagus isn’t in one piece!        Esophageal atresia sometimes also presents with a tracheal esophageal fistula (TEF).  There are 5 types of esophageal atresia:          The most common one is Type C, where you have a proximal pouch, and a distal pouch with a tracheal esophageal fistula.      Type E esophageal atresia is also known as ‘H-type’ esophageal atresia, because the fistula formed between the esophagus and upper trachea makes an ‘H’ shape.  It’s referred to as complete atresia because there are two distinct pouches, with no fistula connecting to the trachea      Type A esophageal atresia is also known as complete atresia, and is harder to surgically repair, because the distal and proximal pouches are very far apart.      Type C, shown in the middle, is the most common type of esophageal atresia.  Remember      There are 5 types of esophageal atresia.    The most common one is Type C, with a proximal pouch, and a distal pouch with a TEF.    In infants with esophageal atresia, how do you make the diagnosis?          They’ll be unable to feed.      Attempts to breast-feed or bottle feed will lead to instantaneous regurgitation.      Often, the nurse will then attempt to insert a NG tube → which will obviously fail, since there’s nowhere for the tube to go because the esophagus is discontinuous.        How can you differentiate between these types of EA?          One differentiating factor is whether there’s air in the stomach when you perform a CXR + an abdominal X-ray.      If there’s no distal fistula (Type A, Type B), then you won’t see air in the gut, because there’s no pathway for it to get in.      If there is a distal fistula (Type C, Type D, Type E), then you would see air in the gut, because it can get in from the trachea through the fistula.      Embryology of Esophageal Atresia  The trachea and the esophagus are originally one tube.  At around 4-weeks, a septum begins to form that separates the two → the esophagotracheal septum.  With EA, for some unknown reason, this division fails to complete, resulting in a missing chunk of esophagus, and often residual communication with the trachea.Presentation of EAIf you’re ever asked what the incidence of a pediatric congenital anomaly is, the answer is almost always 1 in 5000 births!  Incidence = 1 in 5000 births.  Cause unknown.  Environmental teratogens have been associated → birth control pills, thalidomide.  Higher in infants of diabetic mothers  Caucasians &gt; Non-caucasians (2:1)   1.26M : 1F  Even worse, low birth weight males don’t do as well as low birth weight females.  Babies with esophageal atresia often have other associated anomalies (50-70%)          Highest with pure EA, lowest with an H-type fistula (as mentioned before, this is the same as Type E EA).      CVS(35%) → VSD, tet of Fallot, PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), ASD (atrial septal defect)      GI (24%) → other GI atresias (eg duodenal atresia), malrotation (Midgut malrotation, at risk of twisting?! midgut valvus?!)      GU (20%) → hypospadias, undescended testes, renal abnormalities.      Neurologic (10%) → neural tube defects (makes sense, since it’s kind of close to neural tubes)      Skeletal (13%)      VACTERL (25%)                  Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheoesophageal fistula and/or Esophageal atresia, Renal &amp; Radial anomalies and Limb defects.                    Genetic → Trisomies 13, 18, 21.      Diagnosis of EA  Prenatally:          Nowadays, diagnosis is done prenatally with U/S.      Small or absent stomach → since any fluid that’s swallowed can’t get into the esophagus.      Polyhydramnios → no swallowing, more amniotic fluid!      Dilated upper esophagus → if it can’t get through, it distends the proximal pouch!        Postnatally:          Excessive salivation.      Choking, coughing, or regurgitation* with the first feed, since no solids/liquids would be able to reach the stomach.      The nurse is unable to pass a NG tube past 10 cm.                  If the baby isn’t feeding properly, this is usually the next step.          If it doesn’t work, then it suggests that something’s wrong with the esophagus.                    You can see bowel gas with the baby on the left, but on the right, you don't see any bowel gas at all. This suggests that baby on the right has no tracheal esophageal fistula to let air in &rarr; they must have a Type A esophageal atresia. For the other baby, where there's air in the gut, it's most likely to be Type C (the most common esophageal atresia).Workup for an infant with EA  ABCs → make sure their vitals are okay.  Rule out associated anomalies:          Cardiac echocardiogram.      Abdominal U/S.      Karyotype.        Operative repair will depend on the the type of anomaly.          Often, repair will be done within 24 hours of birth, if there’s a TEF. This is because there’s a risk of aspiration, since the distal pouch communicates with the lung.      Surgical repair typically involves making an incision on the right, to avoid the aorta.  This is why the cardiac echocardiogram is necessary, to map out the location of the aorta!      The most robust blood supply is also at the proximal end of the esophagus, not the distal end.      So if you’re trying to attain a healthy lengthened esophagus, you try to extend the esophagus from the top, not from the bottom.      Prognosis of EA  Survival 85-95%.  Worse Prognosis if:          Long Gap EA.      BW &lt; 1500g.      Major congenital heart disease.      Severe associated anomalies.      Possible complications  Even if you repair the esophagus, it won’t be as good as a ‘normal esophagus’.  Anastomotic leak (15%).  Esophageal stricture (up to 40%).  Recurrent TEF (5-15%).  GERD (40-70%) -&gt; destroy gastroesophageal sphincter.  Tracheomalacia (10-20%) → softening of the tracheal cartilage, causing collapse.  Disordered esophageal motility.2. Esophageal Duplication Cyst  Won’t be tested on the exam → focus on Esophageal Atresia!  Duplication Cyst → Duplication of mucosa and submucosa, without the epithelium duplicated.  There are a number of embryological theories:          Aberrant luminal recanalization (Bremer).      Diverticulum theory (Lewis and Thyng).      Environmental factors ie. fetal trauma or hypoxia (Mellish and Koop).      Split notochord theory (Bentley and Smith) → most accepted.      The Split-Notochord Theory  3rd Week Gestation → the developing notochord fuses with the embryonic endoderm.  4th Week Gestation          The endoderm is supposed to separate from the notochord.      But if there are adhesions or bands, then this may fail to happen, leading to a duplication cyst.      This theory explains the frequent association of foregut duplications with spinal column/cord malformations.                  These cysts are then called neuroenteric cysts.                    Presentation of Duplication Cysts  Incidence → 1 in 4500 births.  Only 5% are located in the esophagus → most are in the terminal ileum.  Patients can often have synchronous duplications (15-20%).  If the duplication cyst is esophageal, then there’s an increased risk of vertebral anomalies (75% comorbidity).Diagnosis of Duplication Cysts  Prenatally          Cystic structure in posterior mediastinum.        Postnatally          Respiratory compromise.      Obstructive symptoms eg. dysphagia.      Bleeding eg. hematemesis.      Treatment of Duplication Cysts  Ideally, you want complete excision.  You typically need to resect local regions because of shared blood supplies.  There are long term risks if the duplication cyst is left inside, include hemorrhage, obstruction, airway compromise, and infection.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/03/anatomy-histology-embryology-esophagus-congenital-anomalies.html"},
	{"title": "Embryology &ndash; Development of the GI System", "text": "  Embryology of the GI System Lecture Notes      See GI Embryology Notes.    These expand on the material that’s covered in this class.  Take Home Points  The GI tract starts as a tube suspended by a membrane called the mesentery.  3 parts → foregut, midgut, hindgut.  Each part has a separate blood supply coming out of the aorta. These travel in the mesentary.  Rotation of the foregut and midgut.  The hindgut opens into the cloaca with the allantois, and will be separated by the urorectal septum (remember this from Embryology of the Kidney).  Lines of fusion of the mesentery create intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal structures.The Foregut, Midgut, and Hindgut  Above is a sagittal view of the developing embryo:  The developing GI tract is a tube suspended by a mesentery.          A mesentery is a double layer of peritoneum that supports structures that hang off the abdominal wall.                  Recall that the inside of the abdominal cavity is lined by parietal peritoneum.          This parietal peritoneum reflects around the midline to wrap around the developing organs.          Where the two layers of peritoneum touch (ie, when they’re not wrapping around an organ), you end up with a mesentery.                      Why are mesenteries important?          Vessels can travel inside them → between the two layers of peritoneum.      So they function as a sort of highway for vessels to travel through.        We actually have two mesenteries:          A ventral mesentery that attaches organs to the anterior abdominal cavity.      A dorsal mesentery that attaches organs to the posterior abdominal cavity.        The developing tube itself has 3 parts:          Foregut, supplied by the celiac artery.      Midgut, supplied by the superior mesenteric artery.      Hindgut, supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery.        This is useful, because if you know the developmental origin of a specific region, you’ll know it’s blood supply!          These blood vessels were also the 3 main unpaired branches coming off of the abdominal aorta → recall the ‘Aorta Man’ from Anatomy of the Retroperitoneum.        Also, only the foregut region of the GI tract is attached to both the front and back by the dorsal and ventral mesenteries.          The midgut and the hindgut are only attached to the posterior wall by the dorsal mesentery.        Blood Supply for the GI Tract      The foregut is supplied by the celiac artery.    The midgut is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery.    The hindgut is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery.    The derivatives of the foregut, midgut, and hindgut are listed below.  As mentioned before, since derivatives from the same part of the GI tract hvae the same feeding artery, these are good to know!  Derivatives of the Foregut, Midgut, and Hindgut                    Part        Derivatives        Artery                            Foregut (Proximal)        Oral cavity, pharynx, upper esophagus, respiratory tract.

Eventually, the liver gets so large that it actually breaks out of the double layer of peritoneum, and touches the top of the abdominal cavity, naked.          This is where the diaphragm is.      In other words, you end up with a bare area at the top of the liver, where it’s in direct contact with the diaphragm.      We’ll be seeing this in greater detail later in Anatomy of the Liver, Gallbladder, Celiac, &amp; Portal System.        As mentioned before, the organs are suspended in space by mesenteries.          The space that they are suspended in is called the greater sac.      There is also a lesser sac, which forms behind the stomach, which we will be discussing later.        When the mesentery forms a drape, we have an omentum.Rotations of the ForegutRotation of the Foregut  Both the foregut and the midgut undergo rotation.  Rotation of the foregut especially involves the stomach.          The stomach rotates longitudinally.      The dorsal side curves more rapidly than the ventral side, forming the classic stomach shape.      Then it rotates horizontally, to end up in its final position in the body.        The twisting of the stomach pulls its surrounding mesentery around to create another space → that is the lesser sac.          The mesentery that attaches to the stomach dorsally is the dorsal mesogastrium.      The mesentery that attaches to the stomach ventrally is the ventral mesogastrium.      You can go from the greater sac to the lesser sac through a gap at the free edge of the ventral mesentery. This is near the hepatoduodenal ligament (which will be seen in later lectures).        This also places the other organs into their final position in the body, such as the spleen and liver.          Originally, as shown below, the liver, stomach, and spleen are suspended in a line, anteriorly to posteriorly.      As the stomach rotates longitudinally, the liver rotates to the left to take its final position, and the spleen rotates to the right into its final position.      The mesentery that attached the spleen to the posterior abdominal wall then moves to connect it to the right kidney → forming a lienorenal ligament.      The mesentery that attached the spleen to the stomach then becomes the gastrosplenic ligament.      ‘Lieno’ refers to the spleen, so the lienorenal ligament is a connection to the spleen and the kidney.  Ligaments of the Spleen      Lienorenal Ligament → connects the spleen to the right kidney.    Gastrosplenic Ligament → connects the spleen to the stomach.  Here we see the twisting of the mesenteries caused by the longitudinal rotation of the stomach. This forms the lesser sac behind the stomach.  The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas also arise from the foregut.          These start out as little diverticuli (buds), jutting out of the nascent GI tract.      The liver, gallbladder, hepatic diverticulum, and ventral pancreatic bud, jut out anteriorly.      The dorsal pancreatic bud juts out posteriorly.      So the pancreas arises from two buds, that originally project in different directions!        As these buds enlarge, and the stomach rotates, the buds that projected anteriorly end up on the right side of the body.  The ventral pancreatic bud rotates further, and eventually hits its dorsal companion, and they combine → how romantic!          The superior mesenteric artery actually ends up getting sandwiched between these two buds when they meet.      This becomes important clinically later on in the block.      Rotations of the Foregut AnimationRotations of the Midgut  The midgut is a long tube → it doesn’t actually fit completely into the fetus as it’s developing.          It originally projects out into the yolk sac, and as the fetus develops, the midgut begins to fold into the abdominal cavity. This allows you to end up with a long, convoluted intestine!      This forms a loop that re-enters the fetus near the head (a cranial limb), and the ‘tail’ (a caudal limb).        The midgut undergoes a number of rotations to fit it back into the body.   Developmentally, the following processes occur:          The loop of midgut rotates 90° counter-clockwise (looking out ventrally), so that the cranial limb ends up on the right, and the caudal limb ends up on the left.      The loop of midgut grows, and the future caecum appears as a little bump in the distal limb.      At around the 10th week, the midgut begins to return to the peritoneal cavity → starting from the cranial limb.      As the small intestines fold into the abdominal cavity, the remaining project undergoes another 180° counter-clockwise turn → resulting in a 270° turn in total.                  This wraps the large intestine around the borders of the small intestine, like a picture frame.          The ascending and descending colons eventually become affixed to the abdominal wall → losing their mesentery.                      The ascending and descending colon get affixed to the sides. The transverse stays suspended.Rotations of the Midgut AnimationThe Hindgut  We saw much of this in GU, with Embryology of the Kidney  We effectively have two tubes (the hindgut, and the allantois), entering one common space called the cloaca.          Look over the notes from last year for review.      Intraperitoneal and Retroperitoneal Structures  Recall that:          Parietal Peritoneum → lines the walls.      Visceral Peritoneum → lines the organs.      Mesentery → where two layers of peritoneum meet.        Intraperitoneal Structures lie within the parietal peritoneum.   Secondary Retroperitoneal Stuctures are structures that originally were within the peritoneum (suspended by mesentery), but lost their mesentery after development.          For example, the ascending and descending colon are organs that get ‘stuck down’ to the abdominal wall, because their mesentery folds over and fuses with the parietal peritoneum.      This fusion creates a line of fusion.      This is important surgically, because secondary retroperitoneal structures can by mobilized by separating them along these lines of fusion.        Primary Retroperitoneal Structures are structures that were always outside the parietal peritoneum.          Recall that some of these organs include the aorta, IVC, and kidneys.

	{"title": "Histology of the GI Tract", "text": "Lecture Objectives  With the aid of a diagram, label the different layers of the GI tract.  List the main functions of the GI tract.  Using histological markers, distinguish the following regions of the GI tract, stomach, small intestine, large intestine.  Differentiate between the six cell types in the stomach epithelium and describe one function for each.  List four ways in which the surface area of the intestinal tract is increased for absorption.  Describe the functions of four cell types of the intestinal epithelium.  Name and identify the locations of stem cells in the stomach andintestines.  With the aid of a diagram identify the location of Auerbach’s andMeissner’s nerve plexus.  Describe the function of Auerbach’s and Meissner’s nerve plexus.General Organization of the GI Tract  Functions of the GI Tract include:          Barrier.      Absorption/Digestion.      Secretion: endo-and exocrine.      Motility.        The GI tract is effectively a long tube. Cutting into the tube, there are 4 concentric layers.  Superficially to deeply, we have:  Mucosa          The mucosa changes depending on where we are in the GI tract.        Submucosa          Contain glands that lubricate the mucosa.      Also contains arrangements of nerve plexuses, known as Meissner Plexuses.      These Meissner plexuses innervate the mucosa, and provide sensory function and some motor function.        Muscularis Externa          The muscular external contains two layers of muscle → an outer longitudinal layer and an inner circular layer.                  Recall from Histology of the Urinary Tract that the ureter also has 2 layers of muscle in perpendicular arrangements, except their order is reversed.                    These muscle layers are comprised of smooth muscle, and are innervated by another nerve plexus called Auerbach’s plexus.      These nerve plexuses arise from the autonomic nervous system (the one that we have no direct control over), and are responsible for peristalsis.        Serosa/Adventitia          This is either a layer of dense connective tissue, or a single layer of epithelium (called serosa), depending on the location.        Layers of the GI Tract      Mucosa    Submucosa              Contains glands that lubricate the mucosa.        Also contains Meissner plexuses that innervate the mucosa.              Muscularis Externa              Contains two smooth muscle layers running in different directions → an inner circular layer, and an outer longitudinal layer.        Contains Auerbach’s plexuses which innervate these muscles.        These muscles are responsible for peristalsis.              Serosa/Adventitia  Here you can see the two muscle layers, as well as Auerbach's plexus, which innervates them.The StomachFeatures of the Stomach  The stomach acts as a reservoir and a digestive organ → there is little to no absorption.  The stomach has rugae → folds in the mucosa.  Gastric pits (foveolae) are invaginations in the surface.  The cardiac region releases bicarbonate to neutralize acids from the acidic stomach, protecting the esophagus.Layers of the StomachThe mucosa is split into 3 layers:  Epithelium          Covers the luminal surface of the GI tract.      In the stomach, it forms indentations in the mucosa.        Lamina propria → recall from ITM that this is loose connective tissue.  Muscularis mucosae          A thin layer of smooth muscle separating the submucosa and the mucosa.                  This is important because it is a muscle layer that is independent of the muscularis externa!          This gives the mucosa movement that is separate from that of the muscularis externa.                    Gastric Glands &amp; Gastric Pits  The indentations formed by the epithelium create gastric pits in the mucosa, increasing surface area.  At the bottom of these pits are gastric glands.  These gastric glands release important compounds into the gastric pits, which are critical for stomach function.Cells of the StomachCells in the Gastric Pit  Surface Mucous Cell          Produce mucin and bicarbonate.      This creates a viscous, alkaline mucous.        Mucous Neck Cell          Produce a more soluble mucous.      Can respond to nervous stimuli (eg. excitement about food).      Cells in the Gastric Gland  Parietal Cell          Produces hydrochloric acid (HCl) in response to gastrin.      Also produces Intrinsic Factor, which, as you recall from Blood, attaches to Vitamin B12.                  Vitamin B12 breaks down quickly in low pH, without being protected by binding to Intrinsic Factor.          Recall that Pernicious Anemia was where you didn’t have a problem with B12 intake, but you had a problem with IF.          The Schilling Test was the classic test for this, but it’s no longer done.                      Enteroendocrine Cell          Entero—, in GI tract, Endocrine—, secretes hormones.      Produces gastrin.      Hence gastrin production by the enteroendocrine cell → HCl production by the parietal cell.      This gastrin is actually released into the extracellular space, and ends up in the bloodstream. It’s not secreted directly into the lumen.        Chief Cell          Called chief cells because they’re abundant.      Produces lipase and pepsinogen.        Cell Types in the Stomach                    Cell Type        Produces        Additional Information                            Surface Mucous Cell        Mucin and Bicarbonate        Creates a viscous, alkaline mucous                    Mucous Neck Cell        Mucin        Creates a more soluble mucous                    Parietal Cell        HCl and IF        Responds to gastrin.                    Enteroendocrine Cell        Gastrin        Gastrin stimulates parietal cell HCl production                    Chief Cell        Lipase and Pepsinogen        Pepsinogen becomes Pepsin in acidic environments            Pepsin Activation  Pepsin is the active form of Pepsinogen, which is activated by HCl.  This means that we need the activity of the parietal cell (produces the HCl), the enteroendocrine cell (produces the gastrin that stimulates parietal cell HCl production), and the chief cell (produces the pepsinogen), in order to produce pepsin.  Since pepsin is a key proteolytic enzyme, the cells of the gastric gland are extremely important in digesting proteins.  Remember      Pepsin is the active form of Pepsinogen, and is activated by HCl.              Pepsinogen is produced by the Chief Cell.        HCl is produced by the Parietal Cell, in response to Gastrin.        Gastrin is produced by the Enteroendocrine Cell.            Histology of Gastric Cells  Surface Mucous Cells          Clear cytoplasm, since they contain lots of clear mucin granules.      Histologically, they are simple columnar epithelium.        Mucous Neck Cell          As we begin to transition from the pit to the gland, the cytoplasm starts to stain darker, and the cell type changes.        Parietal Cells          More eosinophilic.        Enteroendocrine Cells          Hard to distinguish histologically, since they lack differentiating histological markers.      Can be identified with EM, by the fact that they secrete granules into the extracellular space, and not into the lumen.        Chief Cells          More basophilic, since they have lots of enzymes and RER, which stain blue.      Contains zymogens (aka. proenzymes), namely pepsinogen, which is activated to pepsin.      The above image shows both parietal cells and chief cells. As said before, parietal cells are more eosinophilic, while chief cells are more basophilic. Note that the band at the bottom right of the image is the muscularis mucosa &rarr; since the gastric pits are formed by invaginating the mucosa, we're still above the submucosa!  Remember      Parietal Cells are eosinophilic.    Chief Cells are basophilic.  The Small IntestineFeatures of the Small Intestine  The small intestine is unique in the fact that they have surface projections into the lumen.  In the duodenum, there are glands in the submucosa called Brunner’s glands          Brunner’s glands provides the mucous in the small intestine (as opposed to the surface mucous cells and the surface neck cells in the stomach).        In the ileum, there are aggregated lymphoid nodules called Peyer’s patches, which detect antigens, and can mount immune responses.  Remember      The duodenum can be identified by having Brunner’s glands, which provide mucous.    The ileum can be identified by having Peyer’s patches, which sense antigens and mediate immune responses.  Structure of the Small IntestineBecause the small intestine is where most of our food is absorbed, it’s designed structurally to maximize surface area.  The small intestine itself is extremely long and coiled.  The mucosa of the small intestine folds upon itself into coiled rings called plica circularis. These travel circumferentially around the intestine.  On the surface of the mucosa there are surface projections called villi.  The cells on the surface of each villus themselves have projections called microvilli.  On the surface of each microvilli is a glycocalyx, glycosylated transmembrane proteins that form a tree-like network.Hence, the small intestine has been designed to maximize the surface area for absorption from an anatomical level down to a molecular level!  Similar to the gastric glands we saw in the stomach, there are intestinal glands, also known as Crypts of Lieberkühn.  These also produce compounds critical in digestion.Histological features of the duodenum are shown here. Note the presence of Brunner's glands in the submucosa &rarr; this is an identifying feature of the duodenum!Lacteals are named as such because they look white and milky when they have taken up a lot of lipids.  The villi of the small intestine are organized into specialized structures that are designed to absorb food.  Within each villus, there’s a capillary network right at the epithelial surface, facilitating absorption.  Each villi has a lacteal, a part of the lymphatic system that functions to absorb lipids.  Remember      Lipid absorption is done via a component of the lymphatic system called the lacteal.    The lacteal absorbs lipids in the form of chylomicrons (we saw this in Introduction to Medicine).          These lipids then enter the general circulation, via the thoracic duct.      Other nutrients are delivered to the liver, via the portal vein.        Hence lipids and other nutrients take different paths in entering the body.  Remember      Lipids enter the body via lacteals, and go directly into the general circulation.    Other nutrients (amino acids, sugars) enter the body via capillary networks, and go to the liver.  Cells of the Small IntestineCells in the Villus  Goblet Cells          Produce mucin.      These are similar to mucous producing cells in the small intestine, except that they have a characteristic goblet shape.        Enterocytes (Absorptive Cells)          Absorptive cells found on the surface of the villi.      These mediate the absorption of nutrients.      Cells in the Intestinal Pits (Crypts of Lieberkühn)  Paneth Cells          Produce lysozymes (not to be confused with lysosomes) → enzymes that break down bacterial cell walls.      Hence Paneth Cells play a key role in acting as a barrier to bacteria in the GI tract.        Entero-endocrine Cells          Intestinal entero-endocrine cells are different from gastric entero-endocrine cells.      Instead of producing gastrin, they produce 2 hormones.                  Secretin.          Cholecystokinin.                    These hormones communicate with the gallbladder and pancreas to tell them to (1) produce digestive enzymes and (2) release bile into the duodenum.      Both are critical for the further breakdown of food in the stomach.        Cell Types in the Small Intestine                    Cell Type        Produces        Additional Information                            Goblet Cells        Mucin        Similar to stomach mucous cells, but goblet shaped                    Enterocytes        N/A        Absorptive cells on the surface of villi                    Paneth Cells        Lysozymes        Lysozymes break down bacterial cell walls.                    Enteroendocrine Cell        Secretin and Cholecystokinin        Stimulates the release of gastric enzymes and bile                  Goblet Cells and Enterocytes are in the villi.    Paneth Cells and Enteroendocrine Cells are in the intestinal glands (Crypts of Lieberkühn)  Histology of Cells of the Small Intestine  Goblet Cells          Shaped like a wine goblet.      Narrow base, and a wide apical end filled with mucin granules.        Enterocytes (Absorptive Cells)          Have a large surface area because they have an array of plasma membrane extensions called microvilli.      The enterocytes are the cells on the surface of the villi with the microvilli! Recall that eosinophilic structures are high in protein, while basophilic structures are high in DNA.        Paneth Cells          Histologically easy to identify, because they have bright eosinophilic granules full of lysozymes that are ready to be secreted.      These are generally at the base of the Crypts of Lieberkühn.        Enteroendocrine Cells          As with gastric enteroendocrine cells, intestinal enteroendocrine cells are hard to identify histologically.      The Large Intestine  The large intestine doesn’t have villi anymore, so it almost looks like stomach.  As with the stomach and small intestine, there continue to be indentations into the surface.  There are more goblet cells and fewer enterocytes:          This makes sense → goblet cells produce mucous lubrication, and as the contents of the gut get thicker, you require more lubrication.      It also makes sense to have fewer enterocytes → since we’ve already absorbed most of the nutrients, the only role for enterocytes here is the absorbing water.      Sample Exam Questions  Which structures are present in the intestinal submucosa?      Muscularis mucosae.    Goblet Cells.    Lacteals.    Crypts of Lieberkühn.    Meissner’s plexus.    Gastric Enteroendocrine Cells:      Contain apical zymogen granules.    Secrete HCl.    Are required for the production of pepsin.    Aid in the absorption of Vitamin B12.    Are abundant in the submucosa.  ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/02/histology-gi-tract.html"},

Anatomy SimulatorIntro Case Presentation  Case Summary      Mr and Mrs Smithers are 51 and 50 years old    Recently moved to London and are seeing a new family doctor    Both generally healthy with normal physical exams and insignificant past medical histories    Hisvfamily history is insignificant    Her family history is notable for colorectal cancer in her father at age 53 and paternal grandmother at age 48    Both willing to undergo all necessary age- appropriate screening exams and tests. The family doctor offers them fecal occult blood which they undergo.    Both sets are OB(-) x3 samples (Occult Blood).    One Year Later      Mr. and Mrs. Smithers return one year later. Mr. Smithers feels fine.    Mrs. Smithers notes a little fatigue and looks a bit pale. Her CBC reveals Iron-deficiency anemia with haemoglobin of 92 and MCV 70. FOBT testing is positive 2/3 samples.    On their next visit, the doctor suggests that they each undergo a screening sigmoidoscopy. They agree. Mr. Smithers has a few diverticulae, and Mrs. Smithers has some internal haemorrhoids.  What do you think might be going on and what would you do?  Occult blood loss could be because of bleeding from her hemorrhoids, or due to a cancer.  If it was something, it would more likely be higher up in the colon, because the sigmoidoscopy only looks at the lower areas of the colon.  Case Continued        She is referred for colonoscopy which reveals a 5 centimeter mass in the cecum.              Ulcerated, firm intraluminal mass.              Biopsies return positive for adenocarcinoma    CEA level is elevated    Staging CT scan shows no evidence of metastatic disease  What treatment is done?  A right hemicolectomy.  The surgical details of this will be discussed later.  Case Continued      Mrs Smithers was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.    Her colonoscopy and CT scan 1 year later showed no recurrence.    By the end of the course, you’ll know what was done right/wrong in this case.  Will be discussed in detail in PCCIA session 1.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/02/intro-digestive-system-nutrition.html"},
