The neoplasm (left is fairly well-circumscirbed, soft, and may be enclosed in a capsule. Sinc it is made of hepatocytes, it will be vascular and will not have a lot of connective tissue. The hemorrhage tracks through and may even be extending to the surface. Note that the hepatocytes are still fucntioning properly. Even malignant cells function well.The cells are extremely well-differentiated. The benign liver is on the ____ and the abnormal liver is on the _____.

HCC can have a wide variety of appearances, but it frequently dispalys a trabecular pattern. In malignant HCC, hepatocytes can be arranged in WIDE cords, but with sinuosidal looking blood vessels and variety in size of nuclei, etc. The more poorly differentiated the hepatocytes become, the less they will function like regular cells.  Routes of Spread of HCC          Intrahepatic                  Direct invasion (see right; the lighter coloured nodules are HCC and they directly invade into the adjacent liver)          Vascular (spread by portal or hepatic veins)          Bile duct                    Extrahepatic                  Hematogenous - lung (most commonly), bone…but can also show up in more distant sites          Lymphatic - porta hepatis (hilum of liver)          Direct (rare)                          To abdominal wall, kidneys, etc.                                Peritoneal (rare)                      Clinical Features of HCC          Present with mass, pain, cirrhotic decompensation, or asymptomatic (identified through a screening program)      Serum alpha-fetoprotein may elevated (although only in 30-40% of patients; this depends on the size of the tumour)      Prognosis ∝ size, number of nodules and vascular invasion        Treatment of HCC          Noncirrhotic pt → surgical resection is the primary treatment      Compensated cirrhosis → transplantation is the primary treatment…but there aren’t enough livers to go around      Other options aim to eradicate the nodule: ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation      Patients with cirrhosis should be in surveillance program (regular serum AFP + ultrasound) because HCC is treatable!      ####Hepatoblastoma- The most common in children- The incidence is increasing    + One hypothesis is that this is due to increased survival of premature babies- Typically quite a large mass at diagnosis- Presents with failure to thrive- Serum AFP is hihgly elevated- Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation and surgeryIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (bile ducts)  Main risk factors in North America          Ulcerative colitis ± PSC (primary sclerosing colangitis - a disease of large bile ducts in young males)      Congenital anomalies of biliary tree      Other                  HCV, ?HBV          Flukes (SE Asia)          Hepatolithiasis (stones in the liver)          (Thorotrast)                          Radiocontrast material 1920’s-50’s              Half life: 400 years!

They are often visible from outside and are well circumscribed in nature. They may be umbilicated if there is central necrosis.These are emtastases from small cell carcinoma of the lung.  Focal Nodular Hyperplasia          Due to arterial malformation in one area of the liver → increased blood flow → local hyperplasia      Often an incidental finding                  Patient will complain of abdominal pain          Might suspect cholecystitis (inflammation of gall bladder), however, on ultrasound, a liver nodule will be visible                          Frequently, it is diagnosed just like this, through imaging              If you are quite sure that it is not focal nodular hyperplasia, you can image it again in 6 months to 1 year to see if it’s changed              If you are not sure what it is, biopsy it!                                          This looks like it could be a cirrhotic liver, but it’s actually focal nodular hyperplasia &amp;rarr; remember, cirrhosis is diffuse, not focal! Moreover, this is a biopsy of a mass lesion, not of the liver.Summary  The #1 benign tumour is a hemangioma  The #1 malignant tumour is from metastasis  The #1 primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/17/liver-masses.html"},

	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Selected Topics in Pathology", "text": "  Case 1  A 40 yr old male came to the emergency department with a 24 hour history of vomiting coffee grounds-like material. He had a long history of alcohol abuse as well as a history of chronic dyspepsia. Upper GI endoscopy was performed, and an oozing gastric ulcer was identified. The endoscopist thought the ulcer looked benign. Endoscopic biopsies were taken.Notes  Vomiting coffee grounds-like material directs your attention to a gastric bleed.  An ulceration of the gastric mucosa must have occurred.  Bleeds occurring in the stomach mix with gastric juices; curdling the blood into coffee grounds-like material.   The blood also becomes oxidized, leading to the black colouration.  Clinical Note – Vomiting Blood:      Esophogeal varices will also bleed into the stomach.    However, the emesis of blood will be red in colour, caused by dilated esophageal veins that rupture within the esophagus.    The patient would likely have a clinical history of alcohol abuse and liver cirrhosis.    This is life-threatening and a medical emergency.  Questions1. What is Your Differential Diagnosis?  Gastritis due to alcohol injury  Chronic dyspepsia points to peptic ulcer disease  Alcohol abuse → ulceration.  NSAID abuse → ulceration.  H. pylori → ulceration.  Tumors are unlikely due to age of patient2. Why were the biopsies taken?  To rule out cancer.  Assess H. pylori status.  Pathological assessment is the only way to make this definitive diagnosis.  Case Continued  He continued to bleed from the ulcer, despite medical therapy, and eventually had a partial gastrectomy.Above (gross): Partial gastrectomy specimen with a gastric ulcer. The ulcer is punched out, gastric folds radiate right up to the edges, edges are regular and flat, not heaped up, base is bloody but clean with no obvious necrotic material.3. Does this ulcer look benign or malignant? Why?  This ulcer looks benign because it appears: punched-out, well-defined, and round with rugae converging at the ulceration.   If the ulcer looked malignant, the ulcer borders would be: mountainous, uneven and ill-defined.4. Can benign (peptic or NSAID-induced) gastric ulcers become malignant?  No, they cannot. Malignant ulcers can masquerade as benign ulcers but benign ulcers have no malignant potential.   Benign gastric ulcers are most often caused by NSAIDs followed by peptic ulcer/H. pylori etiology.   Benign does not mean it cannot kill you. Benign ulcerations have the potential to cause life-threatening bleeds.5. What are the complications of peptic ulcers?  Hemorrhage  Obstruction (especially at the muscular but narrow Pylorus regionthat becomes inflammed)  Penetration (denotes: onto other organs)  Perforation (denotes: into a body cavity space)  Case 2  A 60 yr old male presented to his family doctor with difficult swallowing for 3 weeks. This had been gradually increasing in severity. There was a long history of heartburn for which he regularly used antacids. He was referred to a gastroenterologist who performed an upper GI endoscopy.  Endoscopy showed Barrett’s esophagus, inflammation and irregular, partially ulcerated mucosa. Multiple biopsies were taken.  The patient was referred to a surgeon for definitive management. A distal esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy was performed. The tumor extended through the wall of the esophagus and there were 3 positive lymph nodes.  Pathological Note - Cause of Barrett’s Esophagus:      Metaplasia of the esophagus aka Barrett’s esophagus is caused by chronic esophageal inflammation from acid reflux (GERD).     The esophagus is lined with stratified squamous epithelium and changes to intestinal tall columnar epithelium with goblet cells to better tolerate and protect the esophagus from acid and pepsin.    The metaplastic intestinal epithelium is unstable and prone to dysplasia, which progresses to malignancy.    1. What is the pathogenetic sequence of events that lead to malignancy developing in this patient?  Metaplasia → Low Grade Dysplasia → High Grade Dysplasia → Adenocarcinoma2. Why is it important to biopsy patients with suspected or known Barrett’s esophagus?  Barrett’s esophagus is a pathological diagnosis on the basis of metaplastic cellular changes in the esophagus.  It is important to biopsy to monitor the progression of pre malignant changes to esophageal cancer before it occurs. 3. What is the prognosis in this case?  &lt;10% for 5 yr survival.   This case is very advanced and the prognosis is poor as the malignancy has spread through the esophageal wall and would be able to access other organs. Positive lymph nodes also suggests metastatic spread.  Case 3   A 36 yr old female went to her family doctor because she had noted some bright red blood on her stools and occasionally on the toilet paper. She also complained of fatigue. The family doctor performed a digital rectal exam, which revealed a soft mass. She was referred to a surgeon. The surgeon performed a colonoscopy.   The colonoscopy revealed a 6 cm sessile polyp, 2 cm proximal to the anal verge. Multiple biopsies of the polyp were taken.  The report is signed out by a pathologist as villous adenoma without malignancy. The polyp was removed transanally by submucosal resection.Notes  The 2 most common causes for a young woman to get bright red blood in her stool are:          Anal Fissures      Hemorrhoids        The key to this case is fatigue, which does not occur in either anal fissures or hemorrhoids. 1. What are the two commonest types of colorectal polyp?  Hyperplastic polyp (benign or malignant)  Adenomatous Polyp (benign gland-forming neoplasms composed of dysplastic epithelium) 2. How do these two types differ in their clinical importance?  Hyperplastic polyps have until very recently been considered to be innocuous non-neoplastic lesions but it is now known that these are a heterogenous group of lesions, some of which are neoplastic and pre-malignant.   Adenomatous polyps are the precursors of colorectal adenocarcinomas. The majority of these cancers arise from adenomatous polyps. Removal of an adenoma significantly reduces the subsequent risk of cancer in the patient.  The key fact is that is colorectal cancer is preceded by a benign lesion in almost 100% of cases, which is why the disease incidence can be markedly reduced by screening.3. Why was it deemed necessary to remove this polyp after the pathologist did not find malignancy on the biopsies?  Polyps demonstrate pre-malignant changes and biopsies of polyps may not be representative of the entire section.  Biopsies only sample the surface mucosa, so the entire polyp is removed so pathologists can determine if malignancy is present.  Polyps are deemed malignant in GI if the histological pattern shows invasion.  The risk of malignancy in an adenomatous polyp increases with increasing size of the polyp and is generally higher with villous adenomas than withtubular adenomas. 4. What type of clinical follow-up would you recommend for this patient?  Follow-up should contain surveillance colonoscopies every 3-5 years.  The patient is young, so she is at increased risk for developing more adenomas.  A family history must also be put together, as she may be a genetic testing candidate for Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC).  Individuals with HNPCC get adenomatous polyps and cancer at a younger age than those without the syndrome (however, these patients usually present with right-sided adenomatous polyps).   Pathological Note - Rule of 2’s for malignancy:      20% of 2 cm polyps are malignant.    40% of 4 cm polyps are malignant.    60% of 6 cm polyps are malignant.

	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Esophagus &amp; Stomach", "text": "Case 1  Case Summary  A 60 year old man presents to you with trouble swallowing. The dysphagia appeared three months ago and has been progressive, starting with solids but now occurring with thick liquids. He has lost 10 kg in weight.Notes  Dysphagia = difficulty swallowing  You can diagnose dysphagia with 3 questions:          Solid or Solid/Liquid                  This helps you determine if it’s a mechanical problem or a motility problem.          Solid → mechanical problem.          Solid/liquid → motility problem.          These make sense, if you have          For instance, if there’s a problem with how we coordinate movement down the GI tract, then it’s more                     Progressive or Intermittent                  Some things won’t spontaneously get better (eg a tumour).          Other things may fluctuate (eg. an allergy).                    Associated Symptoms                  For instance, some problems may cause acid backflow, causing heartburn.          With a tumour, you would be looking at potential B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss).                      Discuss the clinical features that help to distinguish:          Oro-pharyngeal vs. esophageal causes.                  This would likely be esophageal.          We don’t see the typical features of an oropharnygeal cause.          Oropharyngeal Causes:                          “Choking sensation”              Saliva hypersecretion              Aspiration (and potentially aspiration pneumonia)              In more common with neurological problems → stroke, neuromuscular disorders, dementia (so, often the elderly).                                Esophageal Causes:                          Associated more with sensations of difficulty/discomfort.              A sensation of ‘sticking’ in the chest.                                In this case, it’s an esophageal problem → the sensation is more of difficulty/discomfort than choking, and there’s no history of neurological problems.                    Motility problems vs mechanical obstruction.                  Motility problems are associated with difficulty swallowing liquids.                          Often motility problems are associated with chest pain.              Patients will often also experience regurgitation, since a problem with motility will affect any aboral movement.                                Mechanical problems are associated with difficulty swallowing foods.                          They are a partial blockage, so liquid can pass through, but solids can’t pass through a smaller diameter.              With mechanical problems, there is usually no regurgitation, since there is still some room for food to pass through beyond an obstruction.                                In this case, it’s probably a mechanical problem, since he has issues with solid foods only, and we don’t see any regurgitation suggestive of a motility problem.                    Benign vs malignant strictures.                  Benign strictures:                          These are slow-growing (years)                                Malignant strictures:                          There are two primary tumours of the esophagus:                                  Adenocarinoma                  Squamous cell carcinoma.                                            These are quickly growing (weeks to maybe months).              Associated with weight-loss:                                  Solid food dysphagia and weight-loss puts malignancy high up on the loss                                            Risk factors:                                  Smoking is a risk for squamous cell carcinomas.                  GERD → Barrett’s esophagus is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma.                  Age, smoking, and caustic ingestions (eg. alcohol) are also risk factors.                                                                          What is the most likely diagnosis? What tests need to be done?          Probably an adenocarcinoma or a squamous carcinoma.      An endoscopy would be done (fairly quickly, considering the rate of growth).      If there was a better time frame, a barium swallow could be used for imaging.      Since this is a pretty clear-cut case, you might as well directly proceed to the endoscopy, because you can do a biopsy simultaneously.      Case 2  Case Summary    A 25 year old male presents with trouble swallowing. The dysphagia occurs with both solids and liquids. It is worse as the meal progresses. There is no pain.  If the patient lies down he frequently experiences regurgitation of non-acidic material into his throat. An upper GI series is shown at right.  What is the most likely diagnosis and why?          The most likely diagnosis is achalasia.                  We see the classic Bird’s beak esophagus.          There’s regurgitation of non-acidic material, suggesting that the material hasn’t reached the stomach before it got regurgitated.          The image is also pretty obvious. The lower esophageal sphincter can’t relax here, so you esophagus proximal to it begins to dilate.                    This is different from scleroderma, which deposits collagen in the muscle to make the sphincter weak, but peristalsis is still present → there would still be flow of acidic fluid.      Also, the patient is young, and is regurgitating (which aligns with a motility problem).        What tests should be ordered?          Manometry → test motor function      Endoscopy → take a scope to make sure there is no growth at the sphincter (eg. pseudo-achalasia due to cancer growing in the cardia, but this would be more likely in an older individual).                  Scoped people are at high risk for aspiration, so mind the risk.                      Describe the principle of therapy          Therapy aims to relax and open the lower esophageal sphincter:                  Medications: nitrates, CCBs (but this is not enough for a young person with severe achalasia).          Endoscopic treatment to physically stretch it out.                          Botox → this wears off in about 3 months.              Pneumatic dilation to tear the muscle (with a balloon) → this has a 5% risk of perforation.                                Surgery                          Surgical myotomy can be done laparoscopically in London.                                          Case 3  Case Summary  A 45 year old female comes to your office with a 2 year history of a burning epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the chest. It occurs typically 15 minutes after she eats and is associated with regurgitation of acid material into her throat.1. What is the most likely diagnosis?  GERD → Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.          We see this after meals (where more acid is secreted).      There’s regurgitation of acidic material into the throat.      We don’t see any signs suggesting otherwise (there’s a 2-year history, so it’s likely not malignant, and we see no oropharyngeal signs).      2. List symptoms that suggest complications:  Ulcers (evidenced by melena).  Esophageal strictures from acid reflux.  Lung problems like aspiration pneumonia.  Asthma (acid causing bronchoconstriction).  Acid reflux damaging vocal chords (hoarse voice).  Dental/gum problems.3. List potential causes / exacerbating factors:Of particular note are medications that are used to treat achalasia! Since they aim to weaken the tone of the esophageal sphincter, they would make GERD worse.  Diet (alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods).  Smoking.  Drugs → especially those for achalasia.  Pregnancy.  Scleroderma.  Obesity.4. When is endoscopy indicated?  Concern for Barrett’s esophagus:          Age &gt; 50, with chronic GERD (about 10% of these will have Barrett’s, and about 0.5%/year will develop esophageal cancer).      Family history of esophageal cancer.      Men, smokers, overweight, GERD and the amount of Barrett’s esophagus.        Complications: dysphagia, vomiting, bleeding, strictures or ulceration, potential cancer.          E.g. 30 year old who vomits blood with heartburn.      5. What is your approach to GERD therapy?  Elevate head off of bed:          Propping yourself up with pillows still makes you bend at the waist, which increases your intra-abdominal pressure and makes things stay inside your abdomen which exacerbates the problem.      Use bricks or telephone books underneath the bed posts! (raise the head of the bed about 10°-15°).        Dietary modification:          Types of foods.      Amounts of foods.      Don’t eat and lie down.      Space out your calories evenly across your meals (don’t load up on dinner).        Weight loss:          There is evidence to show that this improves symptoms in GERD enough to mitigate the need for medications.      Even 20 pounds can make a difference in a 200 pound person.        Stop smoking:          Nicotine relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter which makes it easier to get reflux.      It also dries up mucus (which protects it from acid) leading to ulcers.        Decrease alcohol  Medications (but discontinue harmful medications)          PPIs (prescription required) work very well, even prohylactically before a meal.      H2 antagonists (OTC) work well, but they are less used now that PPIs are so common.      Antacids (OTC) are a quick fix → TUMS is the mainstay in pregnancy.        Surgery:          Fundiplication: wrapping the stomach around the esophagus to create a barrier against reflux.                  It works pretty well, but a lot of patients end up back on PPIs 5 years out. Still, their quality of life is much better.          If there’s a hiatus hernia, they pull the hernia down before they do the wrap.                    Case 4  Case Summary  A 25 year old otherwise healthy male comes to your office with a 1 year history of epigastric abdominal pain. It is intermittent and seems to worsen after eating. It lasts 30 mins to 2 hours. He denies vomiting, weight loss and bleeding. He is a nonsmoker and denies NSAIDS. He feels otherwise well. He has mild epigastric tenderness on palpation.  What is the most likely diagnosis in this man and why?          A peptic ulcer.                  Post-prandial pain, most likely due to acid production.          Epigastric pain, does not radiate, so less likely to be GERD.          Young, otherwise well, so no reason for other diagnosis.                      Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most likely etiology?          Most likely a duodenal ulcer because he is young and there’s no evidence of NSAID use (which would be suggestive of a gastric ulcer).      Also, pain after you eat is more suggestive of duodenal ulcers.                  This is because the acid in your stomach is pumped out into the duodenum after eating.          Gastric ones sometimes actually ‘get better after eating’.                    With duodenal ulcers, the most likely etiology is H. pylori.        List potential complications and clinical features of each.          H emorrhage → melena (black tarry blood in stool), typical of an upper GI bleed, or vomiting blood.      O bstruction → pain, bloating, vomiting.      P enetration → pain (depending on what organ it’s penetrating into).      P erforation → pain, distended and tender abdomen, rebound tenderness and guarding because of peritoneal irritation, acidotic, in distress.        Discuss your approach to the diagnosis and management of this patient.          H. pylori serology testing and blood test.      Empiric therapy → give the patient a PPI and then bring him back.      If he’s H. pylori positive, eradicate it with PPI 4-8 weeks, with 10-14 days of two antibiotics.      If he’s negative, is it GERD or is it an ulcer?                  Can keep him on PPIs if his symptoms resolve, otherwise scope him if you think it’s an ulcer.          If he’s older (&gt; 40-50 years old), definitely scope him because you could be missing a cancer.

Extrapolate the anatomical structures, found on the cadaver and images, to histological, CT and radiographic images in order to interpret clinical findings of a given scenario.Branches of abdominal aortaUNPAIREDSpleen, duodenum- L1 → S uperior Mesenteric → jejunum, ileum, 2/3 colon- L3 → I nferior Mesenteric → descending, sigmoid, rectum			   &gt; ####Tip&gt; Blood supply travels in mesentery and follows development of gut. SMA comes off at the level of L1 - transpyloric planeIMA comes off at L3 - umbilicus Superior Mesenteric ArterySMA can become occluded if there is abnormal growth of the pancreas.   Comes off at L1, behind the pancreas   Between the neck and uncinate of pancreas  Gives branches to the pancreas, duodenum (inferior pancreaticoduodenal)If the midgut rotates around the SMA too much in development, we can get twisting of the SMA. Branches of SMA  Middle Colic:  1st branch coming off the SMA. Supplies transverse colon.   Right Colic: Supplies ascending colon.  Intestinal: Small branches supply the small intestine.   Ileocolic: Supplies cecum, ileum, appendix. Inferior Mesenteric Artery  L3 level, above bifurcation of common iliac artery   Supply to Hindgut structures Descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum.   Gives branches to the left side of the colon, anastomosis with right sided vessels  Blockage of IMA does not result in ischemia of this region due to right sided anastomosis.

Marginal artery of Drummond is followed to 7. which is the kidney.Jejunal vs Ileal branches of SMA  The jejenum and ileum can be differentiated based on the arrangment of blood supply          The jejenum has few arterial arcades (1-2 rows) and long vasa recta      The ileum has many arterial arcades (4-5 rows) and short vasa recta      Venous System  Mesenteric venous drainage goes to the portal vein  Does not drain directly to the IVC  Inferior Mesenteric Vein: Drains the descending and sigmoid colon  Splenic Vein: Drains the spleen, posterior to stomach  Superior Mesenteric Vein: Drains the right side of colon  Inferior Mesenteric Vein: Drains the left side of colon.  Dumps into either splenic vein, SMV, or directly into portal vein.    Junction of Splenic Vein and SMV form Portal Vein entering the liver Jejenum and Ileum  Intraperitoneal  Visceral fat vs. superficial (subcutaneous) fat  The Duodenojejunal Flexure differentitates upper and lower GI bleeds. Large Intestine  Large intestines begin at ileocaecal junction  Appendix is typically inferior to cecum and indicates the large intestine  Tenea coli are longitudinal strands of muscle that are characteristic large intestine  Position of appendix is variable PATIENT CASE  Case Summary  19 year old female presents with dull but intense umbilical pain that spreads to the right inguinal region. Hip extension increases umbilical pain and deep pelvic pain is experienced as well.   Umbilical pain means L3  Important: R/O Pregnancy should be the first thing you do.   This is a case of appendicitis.   The patient presented with Psoas Sign           Hip extension stretches the psoas muscle. The appendix is inflamed and is tucked in the pelvic area, attaching itself to the overlying fascia of the psoas muscle. Pulling of the inflamed appendix during extension results in pain. this is individual with inflamed appendix.         The Obturator Sign is another sign of an inflamed appendixThe Colon  Teniae coli are under chronic contraction causing puckering appearance of large intestine. These indentations are known as haustra and are very typical of the large intestine.  Apendices epiploicae are fat tags hanging off the colon. They are very typical of the large intestine as well.  Lymphatics  Lymphatic drainage follows the vessels   Peripheral nodes are located on the gut wall  Intermediate nodes - arterial branch  Preaortic (celiac, mesentaric &amp; lumbar)  Cisterna chyli and thoracic duct   Common iliac  Inguinal Radiographs  Remember      Always look for leaks, obstructions, masses      Look for diameter, plicae, haustra  Most common cause of obstruction is adhesionsPost-op ensure the patient is passing gas to confirm there is no obstruction.  Post-op surgery, hernias, tumours = adhesions  Splenic flexure is identified. The wall of the colon is thickened. Some sort of colitis is occuring.   A cyst is identified in the pancreas   Diaphragmatic hernia Large intestines are pushed up through diaphragm. Rectum &amp; Anus  Rectum          supported by pelvic diaphragm      Teniea coli end      as passes thru pelvic diaphragm becomes anal canal        Anus          anal columns      opening is controlled by sphincters       Blue line is pectinate line which marks the transition of GI columnar epithelium to anal stratified squamous epithelia       Black line on diagram is known as the white line which marks keratinization as there is continuation with the skin.

	{"title": "Physiology &amp; Pathophysiology of Motility", "text": "General ConceptsFunctions of Motility  Propulsion from oral to anal.  Mixing → mechanical dispersion, increase contact with digestive secretions and absorbing cells.  Reservoir/storage → stomach, gallbladder and colon.Clinical GI Motility ProblemsAchalasia—Greek for ‘no relaxation’—is where the esophageal sphincter is unable to relax, preventing food from reaching the stomach.  Motility is important → problems with motility can cause issues anywhere in the GI tract:          Esophagus → GERD, esophageal spasm, and achalasia.      Stomach → gastroparesis, dumping syndrome, functional dyspepsia.      Small bowel → diarrhea, bacterial overgrowth.      Large bowel → constipation, IBS.      Anus → fecal incontinence.      Generalized GI → pseudoobstruction, diabetes and CT disorders (scleroderma).      Control of GI Motility  Control of GI motility is a complex and multi-faceted process.  There are multiple levels of control:          CNS (brain and spinal cord)                  Top level control.          For instance, motility changes when you’re prepping for an exam, or running a marathon.                    Enteric NS (myenteric plexus)                  Composed of Myenteric plexuses, also known as Auerbach Plexuses, which we saw last lecture.          The GI tract has its own ‘brain’.          There are actually more neurons in the GI tract than in the spinal cord!          This allows most of the patterns of motility to exist independent of the brain.          This is why your gut still works when you’re in a vegetative state.                    Myogenic (unique smooth muscle)                  Some GI motility behaviour is pre-programmed in the muscle itself, just like with cardiac muscle!                    Hormonal (endocrine and paracrine)       Luminal contents                  The stuff in the gut plays a role as well!          For instance, if you have too much acid in the duodenum, it will signal the stomach to slow down gastric emptying.                    Smooth MuscleAborally → away from the mouth.  Smooth muscle is innervated by the enteric nervous system, but it also has an intrinsic activity.          Muscle fibres exhibit a slow wave (spontaneous variations in membrane potential), that propagates aborally.      These slow waves are independent of innervation → they’re part of the muscle.      Interstitial cells of Cajal  Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are specialized cells found in the smooth muscle of the GI tract.          They attach to the outside of smooth muscle cells, and act like a pacemaker to set the rate of depolarization and coordinate the slow wave between smooth muscle cells.      This way, instead of having several independent smooth muscle membrane potentials, they’re coordinated together.      So they play an important role in the generation of the slow wave electrical activity.        ICCs also mediate a phase lag, where the downstream smooth muscle is slightly delayed in depolarizing, so that we produce propagated contractions.Physiology of ContractionsThis is conceptually similar to how hyperkalemia raises the cardiac membrane potential, increasing the risk for arrythmias.  Note that the slow waves don’t produce contractions themselves.          Rather, they bring the membrane potential to a level where it can be more easily stimulated.        Spike potentials are what trigger contractions, via cholinergic (parasympathetic) stimulation.          These spike potentials are inhibited by sympathetic stimulation → this makes sense, since you don’t want to be digesting food when your flight-or-flight response is active.        Slow waves dictate the timing and maximum frequency of contractions (by dictating when the membrane is closest to the threshold potential).  Remember      Slow waves dictate the timing and frequency of contractions.    Spike potentials dictate the triggering of the contractions themselves.  This image demonstrates the concept. Note that you can have slow waves without depolarizations when there isn't parasympathetic stimulation. Conversely, parasympathetic stimulation by itself is insufficient for triggering depolarization without the help of a slow wave. You require spike potentials in conjunction with a slow wave to lead to contraction.Patterns of GI Muscle Contractions  Tonic Contraction → sustained contraction, seen with sphincters.  Peristaltic Waves → propagated rings of contraction moving aborally.  Segmental Contraction → stationary ring of contraction to brake contents, and allow them to mix.           This is like ‘kneading a sausage’ → random, unpropagated rings of contraction that mix contents back and forth.      Sphincters in the GI System  The GI tract is divided into functional subdivisions by sphincters.  These act as valves to regulate forward flow, and prevent backwards flow.  These are muscular high pressure zones:          They relax to allow aboral flow.      They contract to prevent retrograde flow.        The GI sphincters include:          Upper esophageal sphincter → between the pharynx and the esophagus.      Lower esophageal sphincter → between the esophagus and stomach.      Pylotic sphincter → between the stomach and duodenum.      Sphincter of Oddi → separating the common bile duct and the duodenum.      Ileocecal Valve → between the small intestine and the colon.      Internal Anal Sphincter.      External Anal Sphincter.        Throughout most of the GI tract, the pressure is low.  However, at the regions of the sphincter, you have endogenously high contraction pressures → they are tonically contracted.  The sphincter is designed in a way that mediates aboral flow:          If the sphincter distends proximally, then the sphincter relaxes, allowing stuff to pass though.      If the sphincter distends distally, then the sphincter tightens, preventing stuff from coming back up.      The EsophagusEsophageal Functional Anatomy  The esophagus is the junction between the striated muscle of the throat, and the smooth muscle of the rest of the GI tract.          Proximally, the esophagus is striated muscle, just like the throat.      Distally, the esophagus is smooth muscle, just like the rest of the GI tract.        This is important with regards to innervation:          The striated muscle component of the esophagus is under central nervous system control.      The smooth muscle component of the esophagus is under enteric nervous system control.        That’s why when you have a stroke, you may have trouble swallowing, but the rest of your digestion behaves normally.  Peristalsis has two phases, triggered by different inputs:          Swallowing induces primary peristalsis.      Distension induces secondary peristalsis.        Remember      The proximal esophagus is composed of striated muscle, and is innervated by the CNS.    The distal esophagus is composed of smooth muscle, and is innervated by the ENS.  Neural Control of the Esophagus  CNS input to the esophagus is via the vagus nerve.          In the striated muscle component of the esophagus, the vagus nerve innervates the muscle directly.      In the smooth muscle component of the esophagus, the vagal nerves feed into enteric plexuses, and relay CNS signals to the enteric nervous system.        Hence, the vagus nerve directly stimulates the esophageal striated muscle, and indirectly regulates the esophageal smooth muscle (via the enteric nervous system).Control of Esophageal Motility  CNS → Central nervous system.          Triggering of swallowing via the swallowing centre.      Signals from the brain are transmitted via the vagus nerve.        ENS → Enteric nervous system.          Regulates pre-patterned peristalsis.        LES → Lower esophageal sphincter.          Multiple control factors, including neural, myogenic, hormonal, and dietary factors.      Incompetence leads to GERD (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease).      Failure to relax leads to Achalasia.        Remember      An LES that’s incompetent leads to GERD.    An LES that fails to relax leads to achalasia.  The Stomach  The stomach has 3 functions with regards to motility:          Storage (accomodation).      Mixing and grinding.      Emptying (propulsion).        If the stomach fails to empty on time, you can have delayed gastric emptying.  Some causes of delayed gastric emptying includes:          Diabetic Gastroparesis (caused by autonomic neuropathies due to diabetes).      Connective Tissue Disorders (eg. scleroderma).      Post gastric surgery (eg. when there’s a vagotomy).                  In the past, when we had poorer treatments for peptic ulcer disease, vagotomies were used often as a treatment.          By cutting branches of the vagus nerve, you reduce parasympathetic innervation to the stomach, resulting in the production of less acid.                    Stomach Functional Anatomy  Functionally, the stomach can be divided into two components:          Orad Stomach → including the fundus and proximal body.                  This acts as a reservoir, and distends with gastric content.                    Caudad Stomach → including the antrum and distal body.                  This area acts to ‘grind and pump’ gastric content.                    Control of Gastric Motility  Receptive Relaxation → vagal reflexes allow the stomach to accomodate more content without an increase in pressure.          Patients who have a vagotomy have a dumping syndrome.      This is because the patient can no longer accomodate extra contents in the stomach, so it just dumps everything into the duodenum, overwhelming it.        Gastric Contractions → coordinated gastric contractions are mediated by a gastric pacemaker, just like in the heart.          This gastric pacemaker is a dense region of Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICCs), located at the greater curvature of the stomach.      If you make a transverse incision through this area, you can actually make another region of the GI tract become the pacemaker, much like what we saw in Heart &amp; Circulation        Gastric Emptying → the rate of gastric emptying is determined by a combination of factors, including pH, osmolarity, fat, and protein content.          One example is that low stomach pH is sensed by receptors, slowing gastric emptying into the duodenum, preventing it from being overwhelmed with acid.      The gastric pacemaker of the stomach.The Small Bowel  Motility in the small bowel is designed to maximize absorption.          Lots of mixing (to mix contents with secretion)      Lots of circulation too (to increase contact with absorptive cells)      Propulsion occurs in a controlled fashion so that there’s still forward movement.        Intestinal contractions may be (1) propagated or (2) localized, as seen above.          Localized contractions act to mix the contents.      Propagated contractions act to move the contents forward.        So we have intervals of mixing and circulation, along with short segments of peristaltic activity in order to slowly bring food through the small bowel.  There is a special behaviour specific to the stomach and small bowel known as the Migrating Myoelectric Complex (MMC), also known as the inter-digestive cycle.          This is a special activity that’s used to maintain the cleanliness of the small bowel.      Normally, after you eat, you have a ‘fed’ motor activity, which slowly moves content through the small bowel in a way that maximizes absorption.      However, when you fast for more than 6 hours, this transitions into a ‘fasting’ motor activity → the migrating myoelectric complex.                  With the MMC, you have coordinated waves of peristalsis that rapidly sweep everything out of the bowel.          This clears out undigested material, leftover food, and bacteria.                    So the MMC acts as a housekeeper, making sure the bowel stays clean.        Remember      We have a ‘fed’ motor activity and a ‘fasting’ motor activity in the bowel.              The ‘fed’ motor activity maximizes absorption.        The ‘fasting’ motor activity (the MMC) cleans up the bowel.            Here we see progression of the MMC over time. Note the rapid spike potentials that fire when the MMC is occurring.The Colon  The colon mainly functions as a reservoir, and to extract water and electrolytes.  Most of the activity in the colon is in the form of segmental contractions, rather than propagated contractions.          This is to maximize absorption of water, and to solidify the stool.        Interspersed with these segmental contractions are short propagated contractions that move the contents slowly down.  Occassionally, we have mass movements → sweeping waves of propagated contraction down to the rectum.          This triggers the urge to take a shit!      Distension of the GI tract usually cannot be sensed until it has reached the rectum, so you don’t really feel the urge until this has happened.      This diagram illustrates the 3 types of contraction patterns in the colon &rarr; (1), the mixing caused by segmental contractions, (2), the short propagated contractions that slowly push the colonic contents along, and (3), mass movements that push everything down to the rectum, ready to be pooped out!The Anus  We have two anal sphincters          Internal Anal Sphincter                  This is smooth muscle.          Involuntary control → this automatically contracts to prevent ‘leaking’.                    External Anal Sphincter                  This is striated muscle.          Voluntary control → this is what you use to prevent yourself from shitting your pants while you run to the toilet!                      These two sphincters are critical in maintaining continence.  If something is wrong with them, you can have fecal incontinence.          This can be myogenic → eg. obstetric misadventures (tears), or post-hemorrhoidectomy.      These can also be neurogenic →. eg. diabetic neuropathy, cauda equina syndrome.        Remember      We have 2 anal sphincters              Internal Anal Sphincter → smooth muscle, under involuntary control.        External Anal Sphincter → striated muscle, under voluntary control.

	{"title": "Anatomy, Histology &amp; Embryology of the Esophagus &amp; Congenital Abnormalities", "text": "Anatomy, Histology &amp; EmbryologyTake Home Points  Foregut structure develops with an associated respiratory diverticulum, therefore respiratory anomalies may be associated with esophagus development.  Muscular tube of skeletal muscle that changes to smooth muscle in mid-third, reflecting function.  Covered in non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.  Innervation and blood supply varies along course.  Closely related to the descending aorta, left atrium, left recurrent laryngeal nerve, thoracic duct, azygos vein, bifurcation of trachea and vertebral column.  Pathologies of these neighbouring structures may show as constrictions of the esophagus.  Case Example      Presents to the ER with dyspnea and dysphagia.    Dysphagia has increased over past six months, has lost 30 pounds    Dyspnea for 3 months; coughing produces blood-tinged sputum.    Last few weeks he has become quite hoarse and has a painful swelling over the right clavicle.    Examination        Patient is distressed and emaciated.    Laryngoscopy shows left vocal fold is abducted.              This is suggestive of left RLN compression.              CXR → partial destruction of the right clavicle.    Fluoroscopy shows an obstruction at the level of the tracheal bifurcation.    Recall that RLN compression could cause dysphagia.          The left RLN branches around the aortic arch.      The right RLN branches around the right subclavian.        Recall that adjacent to the trachea and the bronchi are lymphatic chains that can easily be enlarged.Embryology of the EsophagusA diverticulum is an outpouching from a hollow, or fluid-filled, structure..  The esophagus is lined by endoderm, and is surrounded by mesoderm, which forms the muscular outer wall.  The respiratory diverticulum and the foregut are originally conjoined.  They separate, forming an esophagotracheal septum, around week 4.  If this doesn’t happen, you can have inappropriate communication between the trachea and the esophagus.          This is a tracheal esophageal fistula, and it’ll be seen in the second half of this lecture.      Position of the Esophagus in the Mediastinum  The esophagus passes through the thoracic inlet in between the vertebral column and trachea, from C6 → T10.          In other words, anteriorly to posteriorly, you have the trachea → esophagus → vertebral column.      It’s sandwiched between the trachea and vertebral column!        It starts to the right of the aorta, but moves anterior to it as it descents.  It passes through an opening in the diaphragm at T10 → the esophageal hiatus.          Recall this from Anatomy of the Retroperitoneum.      We saw that there were 3 openings in the diaphragm:                  The caval opening → T8.          The esophageal opening → T10.          The aortic opening → T12.                    Esophageal Hiatus → The opening in the diaphragm, letting the esophagus through.      The right crus of the diaphragm forms a muscular sphincter-like sling, preventing backflow.      This sphincter isn’t particularly strong, because gravity itself prevents backflow.      Other Relationships  The left recurrent nerve lies between the esophagus and the trachea.          So compression between the esophagus and the trachea could result in hoarseness.        Separated from the vertebral column by the thoracic duct, azygos, hemiazygos, &amp; aorta.  Crossed by the left bronchus, aortic arch, and subclavian artery.Constrictions  There are several regions where the esophagus can be constricted by other systems.          At the origin of the cricoid cartilate.      When it’s crossed by the cartilaginous left main bronchus.      When it passes behind the left atrium.      When it enters the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus.      Thoracic Cross-sectionFeatures of the Esophagus  The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube, from C6-T10.  There are 2 layers of muscle running perpendicularly to one another:          Inner circular layer.      Outer longitudinal layer.        This is similar to the ureter, except that with the ureter, you have an inner longitudinal layer, and an outer circular layer.  The muscular composition of the esophagus changes as you go down:          The superior third is skeletal.      The middle third is mixed.      The inferior third is smooth.        In other words, as you go down the esophagus, it changes from a skeletal muscle composition to a smooth muscle composition (which makes sense, since most of the GI tract is smooth muscle).          As we mentioned before, this makes sense functionally.      The top skeletal component can be controlled voluntarily via the CNS with swallowing.      The bottom smooth component can be regulated with the rest of the enteric nervous system.        This CNS innervation is parasympathetic, via the vagus.Blood Supply  Upper → Inferior thyroid artery &amp; vein.  Middle → Esophageal branches from the aorta, venous drainage into the azygos  Lower → left gastric and inferior phrenic arteries and veins.Innervation  Upper → somatic via the RLN (off the vagus).  Middle/lower → autonomic.Histology of the Esophagus  Recall from yesterday, that there were 4 layers of tissue in the GI tract:          Mucosa.      Submucosa.      Muscularis Externae.      Adventitia        Characteristics of each of these in the esophagus are as follows:          Mucosa.                  Stratified squamous cells.          Prominent muscularis mucosa (recall that this was the thin layer of muscle separating the mucosa and submucosa).          Typically these cells are non-keratinized, although in heavy smokers, they can become keratinized as a protective mechanism.                    Submucosa.                  Mucous glands are here, that lubricate the mucosa.                    Muscularis Externa.      Adventitia.                  Loose connective tissue.          No serosa → no membrane lining that encloses it.          Since there’s no serosa, this means that it can be easily invaded from other tissues. So they’re vulnerable to the spread of infection, for instance.                    Junction Regions  Between the esophagus and stomach, you have a junction where the cell type changes.          The esophagus has stratified squamous cells.      The stomach has simple columnar cells.        Stomach cells are also more heavily covered with mucous, thanks to the mucin producing cells we saw yesterday (surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells).  Case Continued    The patient died and an autopsy revealed a large cauliflower-like tumor obstructing the lumen of the esophagus.The mass had perforated the trachea and surrounded and compressed it.  The left recurrent laryngeal nerve was embedded in the mass. The mediastinal lymph nodes were greatly enlarged and adherent. Both lungs showed signs of scattered nodular metastases. The liver also had round tumors. The destruction of the right clavicle also was found to be cancerous metastasis.Congenital Abnormalities of the Esophagus  We’ll be focusing on two congenital esophageal anomalies:          Esophageal Atresia.      Esophageal Duplication Cyst.      1. Esophageal Atresia  Esophageal Atresia (EA).          Atresia → discontinuity.      Hence, esophageal atresia is where the esophagus isn’t in one piece!        Esophageal atresia sometimes also presents with a tracheal esophageal fistula (TEF).  There are 5 types of esophageal atresia:          The most common one is Type C, where you have a proximal pouch, and a distal pouch with a tracheal esophageal fistula.      Type E esophageal atresia is also known as ‘H-type’ esophageal atresia, because the fistula formed between the esophagus and upper trachea makes an ‘H’ shape.  It’s referred to as complete atresia because there are two distinct pouches, with no fistula connecting to the trachea      Type A esophageal atresia is also known as complete atresia, and is harder to surgically repair, because the distal and proximal pouches are very far apart.      Type C, shown in the middle, is the most common type of esophageal atresia.  Remember      There are 5 types of esophageal atresia.    The most common one is Type C, with a proximal pouch, and a distal pouch with a TEF.    In infants with esophageal atresia, how do you make the diagnosis?          They’ll be unable to feed.      Attempts to breast-feed or bottle feed will lead to instantaneous regurgitation.      Often, the nurse will then attempt to insert a NG tube → which will obviously fail, since there’s nowhere for the tube to go because the esophagus is discontinuous.        How can you differentiate between these types of EA?          One differentiating factor is whether there’s air in the stomach when you perform a CXR + an abdominal X-ray.      If there’s no distal fistula (Type A, Type B), then you won’t see air in the gut, because there’s no pathway for it to get in.      If there is a distal fistula (Type C, Type D, Type E), then you would see air in the gut, because it can get in from the trachea through the fistula.      Embryology of Esophageal Atresia  The trachea and the esophagus are originally one tube.  At around 4-weeks, a septum begins to form that separates the two → the esophagotracheal septum.  With EA, for some unknown reason, this division fails to complete, resulting in a missing chunk of esophagus, and often residual communication with the trachea.Presentation of EAIf you’re ever asked what the incidence of a pediatric congenital anomaly is, the answer is almost always 1 in 5000 births!  Incidence = 1 in 5000 births.  Cause unknown.  Environmental teratogens have been associated → birth control pills, thalidomide.  Higher in infants of diabetic mothers  Caucasians &gt; Non-caucasians (2:1)   1.26M : 1F  Even worse, low birth weight males don’t do as well as low birth weight females.  Babies with esophageal atresia often have other associated anomalies (50-70%)          Highest with pure EA, lowest with an H-type fistula (as mentioned before, this is the same as Type E EA).      CVS(35%) → VSD, tet of Fallot, PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), ASD (atrial septal defect)      GI (24%) → other GI atresias (eg duodenal atresia), malrotation (Midgut malrotation, at risk of twisting?! midgut valvus?!)      GU (20%) → hypospadias, undescended testes, renal abnormalities.      Neurologic (10%) → neural tube defects (makes sense, since it’s kind of close to neural tubes)      Skeletal (13%)      VACTERL (25%)                  Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheoesophageal fistula and/or Esophageal atresia, Renal &amp; Radial anomalies and Limb defects.                    Genetic → Trisomies 13, 18, 21.      Diagnosis of EA  Prenatally:          Nowadays, diagnosis is done prenatally with U/S.      Small or absent stomach → since any fluid that’s swallowed can’t get into the esophagus.      Polyhydramnios → no swallowing, more amniotic fluid!      Dilated upper esophagus → if it can’t get through, it distends the proximal pouch!        Postnatally:          *Excessive salivation.      Choking, coughing, or regurgitation* with the first feed, since no solids/liquids would be able to reach the stomach.      The nurse is unable to pass a NG tube past 10 cm.                  If the baby isn’t feeding properly, this is usually the next step.          If it doesn’t work, then it suggests that something’s wrong with the esophagus.                    You can see bowel gas with the baby on the left, but on the right, you don't see any bowel gas at all. This suggests that baby on the right has no tracheal esophageal fistula to let air in &rarr; they must have a Type A esophageal atresia. For the other baby, where there's air in the gut, it's most likely to be Type C (the most common esophageal atresia).Workup for an infant with EA  ABCs → make sure their vitals are okay.  Rule out associated anomalies:          Cardiac echocardiogram.      Abdominal U/S.      Karyotype.        Operative repair will depend on the the type of anomaly.          Often, repair will be done within 24 hours of birth, if there’s a TEF. This is because there’s a risk of aspiration, since the distal pouch communicates with the lung.      Surgical repair typically involves making an incision on the right, to avoid the aorta.  This is why the cardiac echocardiogram is necessary, to map out the location of the aorta!      The most robust blood supply is also at the proximal end of the esophagus, not the distal end.      So if you’re trying to attain a healthy lengthened esophagus, you try to extend the esophagus from the top, not from the bottom.      Prognosis of EA  Survival 85-95%.  Worse Prognosis if:          Long Gap EA.      BW &lt; 1500g.      Major congenital heart disease.      Severe associated anomalies.      Possible complications  Even if you repair the esophagus, it won’t be as good as a ‘normal esophagus’.  Anastomotic leak (15%).  Esophageal stricture (up to 40%).  Recurrent TEF (5-15%).  GERD (40-70%) -&gt; destroy gastroesophageal sphincter.  Tracheomalacia (10-20%) → softening of the tracheal cartilage, causing collapse.  Disordered esophageal motility.2. Esophageal Duplication Cyst  Won’t be tested on the exam → focus on Esophageal Atresia!  Duplication Cyst → Duplication of mucosa and submucosa, without the epithelium duplicated.  There are a number of embryological theories:          Aberrant luminal recanalization (Bremer).      Diverticulum theory (Lewis and Thyng).      Environmental factors ie. fetal trauma or hypoxia (Mellish and Koop).      Split notochord theory (Bentley and Smith) → most accepted.      The Split-Notochord Theory  3rd Week Gestation → the developing notochord fuses with the embryonic endoderm.  4th Week Gestation          The endoderm is supposed to separate from the notochord.      But if there are adhesions or bands, then this may fail to happen, leading to a duplication cyst.      This theory explains the frequent association of foregut duplications with spinal column/cord malformations.                  These cysts are then called neuroenteric cysts.                    Presentation of Duplication Cysts  Incidence → 1 in 4500 births.  Only 5% are located in the esophagus → most are in the terminal ileum.  Patients can often have synchronous duplications (15-20%).  If the duplication cyst is esophageal, then there’s an increased risk of vertebral anomalies (75% comorbidity).Diagnosis of Duplication Cysts  Prenatally          Cystic structure in posterior mediastinum.        Postnatally          Respiratory compromise.      Obstructive symptoms eg. dysphagia.      Bleeding eg. hematemesis.      Treatment of Duplication Cysts  Ideally, you want complete excision.  You typically need to resect local regions because of shared blood supplies.  There are long term risks if the duplication cyst is left inside, include hemorrhage, obstruction, airway compromise, and infection.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/03/anatomy-histology-embryology-esophagus-congenital-anomalies.html"},

The hindgut opens into the cloaca with the allantois, and will be separated by the urorectal septum (remember this from Embryology of the Kidney).  Lines of fusion of the mesentery create intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal structures.The Foregut, Midgut, and Hindgut  Below is a sagittal view of the developing embryo:  The developing GI tract is a tube suspended by a mesentery (in grey).

This is useful, because if you know the developmental origin of a specific region, you’ll know it’s blood supply!    LISTEN TO THIS LATER.  The foregut has a ventral and a dorsal mesentery.  The mesenteries help suspend the tube in a big open space.  Developing out of the foregut (in vellow), are some diverticuli, which become the pancreas, gallbladder, and the liver.

	{"title": "Histology of the GI Tract", "text": "Lecture Objectives  With the aid of a diagram, label the different layers of the GI tract.  List the main functions of the GI tract.  Using histological markers, distinguish the following regions of the GI tract, stomach, small intestine, large intestine.  Differentiate between the six cell types in the stomach epithelium and describe one function for each.  List four ways in which the surface area of the intestinal tract is increased for absorption.  Describe the functions of four cell types of the intestinal epithelium.  Name and identify the locations of stem cells in the stomach andintestines.  With the aid of a diagram identify the location of Auerbach’s andMeissner’s nerve plexus.  Describe the function of Auerbach’s and Meissner’s nerve plexus.General Organization of the GI Tract  Functions of the GI Tract include:          Barrier.      Absorption/Digestion.      Secretion: endo-and exocrine.      Motility.        The GI tract is effectively a long tube. Cutting into the tube, there are 4 concentric layers.  Superficially to deeply, we have:  Mucosa          The mucosa changes depending on where we are in the GI tract.        Submucosa          Contain glands that lubricate the mucosa.      Also contains arrangements of nerve plexuses, known as Meissner Plexuses.      These Meissner plexuses innervate the mucosa, and provide sensory function and some motor function.        Muscularis Externa          The muscular external contains two layers of muscle → an outer longitudinal layer and an inner circular layer.                  Recall from Histology of the Urinary Tract that the ureter also has 2 layers of muscle in perpendicular arrangements, except their order is reversed.                    These muscle layers are comprised of smooth muscle, and are innervated by another nerve plexus called Auerbach’s plexus.      These nerve plexuses arise from the autonomic nervous system (the one that we have no direct control over), and are responsible for peristalsis.        Serosa/Adventitia          This is either a layer of dense connective tissue, or a single layer of epithelium (called serosa), depending on the location.        Layers of the GI Tract      Mucosa    Submucosa              Contains glands that lubricate the mucosa.        Also contains Meissner plexuses that innervate the mucosa.              Muscularis Externa              Contains two smooth muscle layers running in different directions → an inner circular layer, and an outer longitudinal layer.        Contains Auerbach’s plexuses which innervate these muscles.        These muscles are responsible for peristalsis.              Serosa/Adventitia  Here you can see the two muscle layers, as well as Auerbach's plexus, which innervates them.The StomachFeatures of the Stomach  The stomach acts as a reservoir and a digestive organ → there is little to no absorption.  The stomach has rugae → folds in the mucosa.  Gastric pits (foveolae) are invaginations in the surface.  The cardiac region releases bicarbonate to neutralize acids from the acidic stomach, protecting the esophagus.Layers of the StomachThe mucosa is split into 3 layers:  Epithelium          Covers the luminal surface of the GI tract.      In the stomach, it forms indentations in the mucosa.        Lamina propria → recall from ITM that this is loose connective tissue.  Muscularis mucosae          A thin layer of smooth muscle separating the submucosa and the mucosa.                  This is important because it is a muscle layer that is independent of the muscularis externa!          This gives the mucosa movement that is separate from that of the muscularis externa.                    Gastric Glands &amp; Gastric Pits  The indentations formed by the epithelium create gastric pits in the mucosa, increasing surface area.  At the bottom of these pits are gastric glands.  These gastric glands release important compounds into the gastric pits, which are critical for stomach function.Cells of the StomachCells in the Gastric Pit  Surface Mucous Cell          Produce mucin and bicarbonate.      This creates a viscous, alkaline mucous.        Mucous Neck Cell          Produce a more soluble mucous.      Can respond to nervous stimuli (eg. excitement about food).      Cells in the Gastric Gland  Parietal Cell          Produces hydrochloric acid (HCl) in response to gastrin.      Also produces Intrinsic Factor, which, as you recall from Blood, attaches to Vitamin B12.                  Vitamin B12 breaks down quickly in low pH, without being protected by binding to Intrinsic Factor.          Recall that Pernicious Anemia was where you didn’t have a problem with B12 intake, but you had a problem with IF.          The Schilling Test was the classic test for this, but it’s no longer done.                      Enteroendocrine Cell          Entero—, in GI tract, Endocrine—, secretes hormones.      Produces gastrin.      Hence gastrin production by the enteroendocrine cell → HCl production by the parietal cell.      This gastrin is actually released into the extracellular space, and ends up in the bloodstream. It’s not secreted directly into the lumen.        Chief Cell          Called chief cells because they’re abundant.      Produces lipase and pepsinogen.        Cell Types in the Stomach                    Cell Type        Produces        Additional Information                            Surface Mucous Cell        Mucin and Bicarbonate        Creates a viscous, alkaline mucous                    Mucous Neck Cell        Mucin        Creates a more soluble mucous                    Parietal Cell        HCl and IF        Responds to gastrin.                    Enteroendocrine Cell        Gastrin        Gastrin stimulates parietal cell HCl production                    Chief Cell        Lipase and Pepsinogen        Pepsinogen becomes Pepsin in acidic environments            Pepsin Activation  Pepsin is the active form of Pepsinogen, which is activated by HCl.  This means that we need the activity of the parietal cell (produces the HCl), the enteroendocrine cell (produces the gastrin that stimulates parietal cell HCl production), and the chief cell (produces the pepsinogen), in order to produce pepsin.  Since pepsin is a key proteolytic enzyme, the cells of the gastric gland are extremely important in digesting proteins.  Remember      Pepsin is the active form of Pepsinogen, and is activated by HCl.              Pepsinogen is produced by the Chief Cell.        HCl is produced by the Parietal Cell, in response to Gastrin.        Gastrin is produced by the Enteroendocrine Cell.            Histology of Gastric Cells  Surface Mucous Cells          Clear cytoplasm, since they contain lots of clear mucin granules.      Histologically, they are simple columnar epithelium.        Mucous Neck Cell          As we begin to transition from the pit to the gland, the cytoplasm starts to stain darker, and the cell type changes.        Parietal Cells          More eosinophilic.        Enteroendocrine Cells          Hard to distinguish histologically, since they lack differentiating histological markers.      Can be identified with EM, by the fact that they secrete granules into the extracellular space, and not into the lumen.        Chief Cells          More basophilic, since they have lots of enzymes and RER, which stain blue.      Contains zymogens (aka. proenzymes), namely pepsinogen, which is activated to pepsin.      The above image shows both parietal cells and chief cells. As said before, parietal cells are more eosinophilic, while chief cells are more basophilic. Note that the band at the bottom right of the image is the muscularis mucosa &rarr; since the gastric pits are formed by invaginating the mucosa, we're still above the submucosa!  Remember      Parietal Cells are eosinophilic.    Chief Cells are basophilic.  The Small IntestineFeatures of the Small Intestine  The small intestine is unique in the fact that they have surface projections into the lumen.  In the duodenum, there are glands in the submucosa called Brunner’s glands          Brunner’s glands provides the mucous in the small intestine (as opposed to the surface mucous cells and the surface neck cells in the stomach).        In the ileum, there are aggregated lymphoid nodules called Peyer’s patches, which detect antigens, and can mount immune responses.  Remember      The duodenum can be identified by having Brunner’s glands, which provide mucous.    The ileum can be identified by having Peyer’s patches, which sense antigens and mediate immune responses.  Structure of the Small IntestineBecause the small intestine is where most of our food is absorbed, it’s designed structurally to maximize surface area.  The small intestine itself is extremely long and coiled.  The mucosa of the small intestine folds upon itself into coiled rings called plica circularis. These travel circumferentially around the intestine.  On the surface of the mucosa there are surface projections called villi.  The cells on the surface of each villus themselves have projections called microvilli.  On the surface of each microvilli is a glycocalyx, glycosylated transmembrane proteins that form a tree-like network.Hence, the small intestine has been designed to maximize the surface area for absorption from an anatomical level down to a molecular level!  Similar to the gastric glands we saw in the stomach, there are intestinal glands, also known as Crypts of Lieberkühn.  These also produce compounds critical in digestion.Histological features of the duodenum are shown here. Note the presence of Brunner's glands in the submucosa &rarr; this is an identifying feature of the duodenum!Lacteals are named as such because they look white and milky when they have taken up a lot of lipids.  The villi of the small intestine are organized into specialized structures that are designed to absorb food.  Within each villus, there’s a capillary network right at the epithelial surface, facilitating absorption.  Each villi has a lacteal, a part of the lymphatic system that functions to absorb lipids.  Remember      Lipid absorption is done via a component of the lymphatic system called the lacteal.    The lacteal absorbs lipids in the form of chylomicrons (we saw this in Introduction to Medicine).          These lipids then enter the general circulation, via the thoracic duct.      Other nutrients are delivered to the liver, via the portal vein.        Hence lipids and other nutrients take different paths in entering the body.  Remember      Lipids enter the body via lacteals, and go directly into the general circulation.    Other nutrients (amino acids, sugars) enter the body via capillary networks, and go to the liver.  Cells of the Small IntestineCells in the Villus  Goblet Cells          Produce mucin.      These are similar to mucous producing cells in the small intestine, except that they have a characteristic goblet shape.        Enterocytes (Absorptive Cells)          Absorptive cells found on the surface of the villi.      These mediate the absorption of nutrients.      Cells in the Intestinal Pits (Crypts of Lieberkühn)  Paneth Cells          Produce lysozymes (not to be confused with lysosomes) → enzymes that break down bacterial cell walls.      Hence Paneth Cells play a key role in acting as a barrier to bacteria in the GI tract.        Entero-endocrine Cells          Intestinal entero-endocrine cells are different from gastric entero-endocrine cells.      Instead of producing gastrin, they produce 2 hormones.                  Secretin.          Cholecystokinin.                    These hormones communicate with the gallbladder and pancreas to tell them to (1) produce digestive enzymes and (2) release bile into the duodenum.      Both are critical for the further breakdown of food in the stomach.        Cell Types in the Small Intestine                    Cell Type        Produces        Additional Information                            Goblet Cells        Mucin        Similar to stomach mucous cells, but goblet shaped                    Enterocytes        N/A        Absorptive cells on the surface of villi                    Paneth Cells        Lysozymes        Lysozymes break down bacterial cell walls.                    Enteroendocrine Cell        Secretin and Cholecystokinin        Stimulates the release of gastric enzymes and bile                  Goblet Cells and Enterocytes are in the villi.    Paneth Cells and Enteroendocrine Cells are in the intestinal glands (Crypts of Lieberkühn)  Histology of Cells of the Small Intestine  Goblet Cells          Shaped like a wine goblet.      Narrow base, and a wide apical end filled with mucin granules.        Enterocytes (Absorptive Cells)          Have a large surface area because they have an array of plasma membrane extensions called microvilli.      The enterocytes are the cells on the surface of the villi with the microvilli! Recall that eosinophilic structures are high in protein, while basophilic structures are high in DNA.        Paneth Cells          Histologically easy to identify, because they have bright eosinophilic granules full of lysozymes that are ready to be secreted.      These are generally at the base of the Crypts of Lieberkühn.        Enteroendocrine Cells          As with gastric enteroendocrine cells, intestinal enteroendocrine cells are hard to identify histologically.      The Large Intestine  The large intestine doesn’t have villi anymore, so it almost looks like stomach.  As with the stomach and small intestine, there continue to be indentations into the surface.  There are more goblet cells and fewer enterocytes:          This makes sense → goblet cells produce mucous lubrication, and as the contents of the gut get thicker, you require more lubrication.      It also makes sense to have fewer enterocytes → since we’ve already absorbed most of the nutrients, the only role for enterocytes here is the absorbing water.      Sample Exam Questions  Which structures are present in the intestinal submucosa?      Muscularis mucosae.    Goblet Cells.    Lacteals.    Crypts of Lieberkühn.    Meissner’s plexus.    Gastric Enteroendocrine Cells:      Contain apical zymogen granules.    Secrete HCl.    Are required for the production of pepsin.    Aid in the absorption of Vitamin B12.    Are abundant in the submucosa.  ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/02/histology-gi-tract.html"},

Anatomy SimulatorIntro Case Presentation  Case Summary      Mr and Mrs Smithers are 51 and 50 years old    Recently moved to London and are seeing a new family doctor    Both generally healthy with normal physical exams and insignificant past medical histories    Hisvfamily history is insignificant    Her family history is notable for colorectal cancer in her father at age 53 and paternal grandmother at age 48    Both willing to undergo all necessary age- appropriate screening exams and tests. The family doctor offers them fecal occult blood which they undergo.    Both sets are OB(-) x3 samples (Occult Blood).    One Year Later      Mr. and Mrs. Smithers return one year later. Mr. Smithers feels fine.    Mrs. Smithers notes a little fatigue and looks a bit pale. Her CBC reveals Iron-deficiency anemia with haemoglobin of 92 and MCV 70. FOBT testing is positive 2/3 samples.    On their next visit, the doctor suggests that they each undergo a screening sigmoidoscopy. They agree. Mr. Smithers has a few diverticulae, and Mrs. Smithers has some internal haemorrhoids.  What do you think might be going on and what would you do?  Occult blood loss could be because of bleeding from her hemorrhoids, or due to a cancer.  If it was something, it would more likely be higher up in the colon, because the sigmoidoscopy only looks at the lower areas of the colon.  Case Continued        She is referred for colonoscopy which reveals a 5 centimeter mass in the cecum.              Ulcerated, firm intraluminal mass.              Biopsies return positive for adenocarcinoma    CEA level is elevated    Staging CT scan shows no evidence of metastatic disease  What treatment is done?  A right hemicolectomy.  The surgical details of this will be discussed later.  Case Continued      Mrs Smithers was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.    Her colonoscopy and CT scan 1 year later showed no recurrence.    By the end of the course, you’ll know what was done right/wrong in this case.  Will be discussed in detail in PCCIA session 1.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/02/intro-digestive-system-nutrition.html"},
