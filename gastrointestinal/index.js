	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Selected Topics in Pathology", "text": "  Case 1  A 40 yr old male came to the emergency department with a 24 hour history of vomiting coffee grounds-like material. He had a long history of alcohol abuse as well as a history of chronic dyspepsia. Upper GI endoscopy was performed, and an oozing gastric ulcer was identified. The endoscopist thought the ulcer looked benign. Endoscopic biopsies were taken.Notes  Vomiting coffee grounds-like material directs your attention to a gastric bleed.  An ulceration of the gastric mucosa must have occurred.  Bleeds occurring in the stomach mix with gastric juices; curdling the blood into coffee grounds-like material.   The blood also becomes oxidized, leading to the black colouration.  Clinical Note – Vomiting Blood:      Esophogeal varices will also bleed into the stomach.    However, the emesis of blood will be red in colour, caused by dilated esophageal veins that rupture within the esophagus.    The patient would likely have a clinical history of alcohol abuse and liver cirrhosis.    This is life-threatening and a medical emergency.  Questions1. What is Your Differential Diagnosis?  Gastritis due to alcohol injury  Chronic dyspepsia points to peptic ulcer disease  Alcohol abuse → ulceration.  NSAID abuse → ulceration.  H. pylori → ulceration.  Tumors are unlikely due to age of patient2. Why were the biopsies taken?  To rule out cancer.  Assess H. pylori status.  Pathological assessment is the only way to make this definitive diagnosis.  Case Continued  He continued to bleed from the ulcer, despite medical therapy, and eventually had a partial gastrectomy.Above (gross): Partial gastrectomy specimen with a gastric ulcer. The ulcer is punched out, gastric folds radiate right up to the edges, edges are regular and flat, not heaped up, base is bloody but clean with no obvious necrotic material.3. Does this ulcer look benign or malignant? Why?  This ulcer looks benign because it appears: punched-out, well-defined, and round with rugae converging at the ulceration.   If the ulcer looked malignant, the ulcer borders would be: mountainous, uneven and ill-defined.4. Can benign (peptic or NSAID-induced) gastric ulcers become malignant?  No, they cannot. Malignant ulcers can masquerade as benign ulcers but benign ulcers have no malignant potential.   Benign gastric ulcers are most often caused by NSAIDs followed by peptic ulcer/H. pylori etiology.   Benign does not mean it cannot kill you. Benign ulcerations have the potential to cause life-threatening bleeds.5. What are the complications of peptic ulcers?  Hemorrhage  Obstruction (especially at the muscular but narrow Pylorus regionthat becomes inflammed)  Penetration (denotes: onto other organs)  Perforation (denotes: into a body cavity space)  Case 2  A 60 yr old male presented to his family doctor with difficult swallowing for 3 weeks. This had been gradually increasing in severity. There was a long history of heartburn for which he regularly used antacids. He was referred to a gastroenterologist who performed an upper GI endoscopy.  Endoscopy showed Barrett’s esophagus, inflammation and irregular, partially ulcerated mucosa. Multiple biopsies were taken.  The patient was referred to a surgeon for definitive management. A distal esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy was performed. The tumor extended through the wall of the esophagus and there were 3 positive lymph nodes.  Pathological Note - Cause of Barrett’s Esophagus:      Metaplasia of the esophagus aka Barrett’s esophagus is caused by chronic esophageal inflammation from acid reflux (GERD).     The esophagus is lined with stratified squamous epithelium and changes to intestinal tall columnar epithelium with goblet cells to better tolerate and protect the esophagus from acid and pepsin.    The metaplastic intestinal epithelium is unstable and prone to dysplasia, which progresses to malignancy.    1. What is the pathogenetic sequence of events that lead to malignancy developing in this patient?  Metaplasia → Low Grade Dysplasia → High Grade Dysplasia → Adenocarcinoma2. Why is it important to biopsy patients with suspected or known Barrett’s esophagus?  Barrett’s esophagus is a pathological diagnosis on the basis of metaplastic cellular changes in the esophagus.  It is important to biopsy to monitor the progression of pre malignant changes to esophageal cancer before it occurs. 3. What is the prognosis in this case?  &lt;10% for 5 yr survival.   This case is very advanced and the prognosis is poor as the malignancy has spread through the esophageal wall and would be able to access other organs. Positive lymph nodes also suggests metastatic spread.  Case 3   A 36 yr old female went to her family doctor because she had noted some bright red blood on her stools and occasionally on the toilet paper. She also complained of fatigue. The family doctor performed a digital rectal exam, which revealed a soft mass. She was referred to a surgeon. The surgeon performed a colonoscopy.   The colonoscopy revealed a 6 cm sessile polyp, 2 cm proximal to the anal verge. Multiple biopsies of the polyp were taken.  The report is signed out by a pathologist as villous adenoma without malignancy. The polyp was removed transanally by submucosal resection.Notes  The 2 most common causes for a young woman to get bright red blood in her stool are:          Anal Fissures      Hemorrhoids        The key to this case is fatigue, which does not occur in either anal fissures or hemorrhoids. 1. What are the two commonest types of colorectal polyp?  Hyperplastic polyp (benign or malignant)  Adenomatous Polyp (benign gland-forming neoplasms composed of dysplastic epithelium) 2. How do these two types differ in their clinical importance?  Hyperplastic polyps have until very recently been considered to be innocuous non-neoplastic lesions but it is now known that these are a heterogenous group of lesions, some of which are neoplastic and pre-malignant.   Adenomatous polyps are the precursors of colorectal adenocarcinomas. The majority of these cancers arise from adenomatous polyps. Removal of an adenoma significantly reduces the subsequent risk of cancer in the patient.  The key fact is that is colorectal cancer is preceded by a benign lesion in almost 100% of cases, which is why the disease incidence can be markedly reduced by screening.3. Why was it deemed necessary to remove this polyp after the pathologist did not find malignancy on the biopsies?  Polyps demonstrate pre-malignant changes and biopsies of polyps may not be representative of the entire section.  Biopsies only sample the surface mucosa, so the entire polyp is removed so pathologists can determine if malignancy is present.  Polyps are deemed malignant in GI if the histological pattern shows invasion.  The risk of malignancy in an adenomatous polyp increases with increasing size of the polyp and is generally higher with villous adenomas than withtubular adenomas. 4. What type of clinical follow-up would you recommend for this patient?  Follow-up should contain surveillance colonoscopies every 3-5 years.  The patient is young, so she is at increased risk for developing more adenomas.  A family history must also be put together, as she may be a genetic testing candidate for Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC).  Individuals with HNPCC get adenomatous polyps and cancer at a younger age than those without the syndrome (however, these patients usually present with right-sided adenomatous polyps).   Pathological Note - Rule of 2’s for malignancy:      20% of 2 cm polyps are malignant.    40% of 4 cm polyps are malignant.    60% of 6 cm polyps are malignant.

	{"title": "Small Group &ndash; Esophagus &amp; Stomach", "text": "Case 1  Case Summary  A 60 year old man presents to you with trouble swallowing. The dysphagia appeared three months ago and has been progressive, starting with solids but now occurring with thick liquids. He has lost 10 kg in weight.Notes  Dysphagia = difficulty swallowing  You can diagnose dysphagia with 3 questions:          Solid or Solid/Liquid                  This helps you determine if it’s a mechanical problem or a motility problem.          Solid → mechanical problem.          Solid/liquid → motility problem.          These make sense, if you have          For instance, if there’s a problem with how we coordinate movement down the GI tract, then it’s more                     Progressive or Intermittent                  Some things won’t spontaneously get better (eg a tumour).          Other things may fluctuate (eg. an allergy).                    Associated Symptoms                  For instance, some problems may cause acid backflow, causing heartburn.          With a tumour, you would be looking at potential B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss).                      Discuss the clinical features that help to distinguish:          Oro-pharyngeal vs. esophageal causes.                  This would likely be esophageal.          We don’t see the typical features of an oropharnygeal cause.          Oropharyngeal Causes:                          “Choking sensation”              Saliva hypersecretion              Aspiration (and potentially aspiration pneumonia)              In more common with neurological problems → stroke, neuromuscular disorders, dementia (so, often the elderly).                                Esophageal Causes:                          Associated more with sensations of difficulty/discomfort.              A sensation of ‘sticking’ in the chest.                                In this case, it’s an esophageal problem → the sensation is more of difficulty/discomfort than choking, and there’s no history of neurological problems.                    Motility problems vs mechanical obstruction.                  Motility problems are associated with difficulty swallowing liquids.                          Often motility problems are associated with chest pain.              Patients will often also experience regurgitation, since a problem with motility will affect any aboral movement.                                Mechanical problems are associated with difficulty swallowing foods.                          They are a partial blockage, so liquid can pass through, but solids can’t pass through a smaller diameter.              With mechanical problems, there is usually no regurgitation, since there is still some room for food to pass through beyond an obstruction.                                In this case, it’s probably a mechanical problem, since he has issues with solid foods only, and we don’t see any regurgitation suggestive of a motility problem.                    Benign vs malignant strictures.                  Benign strictures:                          These are slow-growing (years)                                Malignant strictures:                          There are two primary tumours of the esophagus:                                  Adenocarinoma                  Squamous cell carcinoma.                                            These are quickly growing (weeks to maybe months).              Associated with weight-loss:                                  Solid food dysphagia and weight-loss puts malignancy high up on the loss                                            Risk factors:                                  Smoking is a risk for squamous cell carcinomas.                  GERD → Barrett’s esophagus is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma.                  Age, smoking, and caustic ingestions (eg. alcohol) are also risk factors.                                                                          What is the most likely diagnosis? What tests need to be done?          Probably an adenocarcinoma or a squamous carcinoma.      An endoscopy would be done (fairly quickly, considering the rate of growth).      If there was a better time frame, a barium swallow could be used for imaging.      Since this is a pretty clear-cut case, you might as well directly proceed to the endoscopy, because you can do a biopsy simultaneously.      Case 2  Case Summary    A 25 year old male presents with trouble swallowing. The dysphagia occurs with both solids and liquids. It is worse as the meal progresses. There is no pain.  If the patient lies down he frequently experiences regurgitation of non-acidic material into his throat. An upper GI series is shown at right.  What is the most likely diagnosis and why?          The most likely diagnosis is achalasia.                  We see the classic Bird’s beak esophagus.          There’s regurgitation of non-acidic material, suggesting that the material hasn’t reached the stomach before it got regurgitated.          The image is also pretty obvious. The lower esophageal sphincter can’t relax here, so you esophagus proximal to it begins to dilate.                    This is different from scleroderma, which deposits collagen in the muscle to make the sphincter weak, but peristalsis is still present → there would still be flow of acidic fluid.      Also, the patient is young, and is regurgitating (which aligns with a motility problem).        What tests should be ordered?          Manometry → test motor function      Endoscopy → take a scope to make sure there is no growth at the sphincter (eg. pseudo-achalasia due to cancer growing in the cardia, but this would be more likely in an older individual).                  Scoped people are at high risk for aspiration, so mind the risk.                      Describe the principle of therapy          Therapy aims to relax and open the lower esophageal sphincter:                  Medications: nitrates, CCBs (but this is not enough for a young person with severe achalasia).          Endoscopic treatment to physically stretch it out.                          Botox → this wears off in about 3 months.              Pneumatic dilation to tear the muscle (with a balloon) → this has a 5% risk of perforation.                                Surgery                          Surgical myotomy can be done laparoscopically in London.                                          Case 3  Case Summary  A 45 year old female comes to your office with a 2 year history of a burning epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the chest. It occurs typically 15 minutes after she eats and is associated with regurgitation of acid material into her throat.1. What is the most likely diagnosis?  GERD → Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.          We see this after meals (where more acid is secreted).      There’s regurgitation of acidic material into the throat.      We don’t see any signs suggesting otherwise (there’s a 2-year history, so it’s likely not malignant, and we see no oropharyngeal signs).      2. List symptoms that suggest complications:  Ulcers (evidenced by melena).  Esophageal strictures from acid reflux.  Lung problems like aspiration pneumonia.  Asthma (acid causing bronchoconstriction).  Acid reflux damaging vocal chords (hoarse voice).  Dental/gum problems.3. List potential causes / exacerbating factors:Of particular note are medications that are used to treat achalasia! Since they aim to weaken the tone of the esophageal sphincter, they would make GERD worse.  Diet (alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods).  Smoking.  Drugs → especially those for achalasia.  Pregnancy.  Scleroderma.  Obesity.4. When is endoscopy indicated?  Concern for Barrett’s esophagus:          Age &gt; 50, with chronic GERD (about 10% of these will have Barrett’s, and about 0.5%/year will develop esophageal cancer).      Family history of esophageal cancer.      Men, smokers, overweight, GERD and the amount of Barrett’s esophagus.        Complications: dysphagia, vomiting, bleeding, strictures or ulceration, potential cancer.          E.g. 30 year old who vomits blood with heartburn.      5. What is your approach to GERD therapy?  Elevate head off of bed:          Propping yourself up with pillows still makes you bend at the waist, which increases your intra-abdominal pressure and makes things stay inside your abdomen which exacerbates the problem.      Use bricks or telephone books underneath the bed posts! (raise the head of the bed about 10°-15°).        Dietary modification:          Types of foods.      Amounts of foods.      Don’t eat and lie down.      Space out your calories evenly across your meals (don’t load up on dinner).        Weight loss:          There is evidence to show that this improves symptoms in GERD enough to mitigate the need for medications.      Even 20 pounds can make a difference in a 200 pound person.        Stop smoking:          Nicotine relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter which makes it easier to get reflux.      It also dries up mucus (which protects it from acid) leading to ulcers.        Decrease alcohol  Medications (but discontinue harmful medications)          PPIs (prescription required) work very well, even prohylactically before a meal.      H2 antagonists (OTC) work well, but they are less used now that PPIs are so common.      Antacids (OTC) are a quick fix → TUMS is the mainstay in pregnancy.        Surgery:          Fundiplication: wrapping the stomach around the esophagus to create a barrier against reflux.                  It works pretty well, but a lot of patients end up back on PPIs 5 years out. Still, their quality of life is much better.          If there’s a hiatus hernia, they pull the hernia down before they do the wrap.                    Case 4  Case Summary  A 25 year old otherwise healthy male comes to your office with a 1 year history of epigastric abdominal pain. It is intermittent and seems to worsen after eating. It lasts 30 mins to 2 hours. He denies vomiting, weight loss and bleeding. He is a nonsmoker and denies NSAIDS. He feels otherwise well. He has mild epigastric tenderness on palpation.  What is the most likely diagnosis in this man and why?          A peptic ulcer.                  Post-prandial pain, most likely due to acid production.          Epigastric pain, does not radiate, so less likely to be GERD.          Young, otherwise well, so no reason for other diagnosis.                      Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most likely etiology?          Most likely a duodenal ulcer because he is young and there’s no evidence of NSAID use (which would be suggestive of a gastric ulcer).      Also, pain after you eat is more suggestive of duodenal ulcers.                  This is because the acid in your stomach is pumped out into the duodenum after eating.          Gastric ones sometimes actually ‘get better after eating’.                    With duodenal ulcers, the most likely etiology is H. pylori.        List potential complications and clinical features of each.          H emorrhage → melena (black tarry blood in stool), typical of an upper GI bleed, or vomiting blood.      O bstruction → pain, bloating, vomiting.      P enetration → pain (depending on what organ it’s penetrating into).      P erforation → pain, distended and tender abdomen, rebound tenderness and guarding because of peritoneal irritation, acidotic, in distress.        Discuss your approach to the diagnosis and management of this patient.          H. pylori serology testing and blood test.      Empiric therapy → give the patient a PPI and then bring him back.      If he’s H. pylori positive, eradicate it with PPI 4-8 weeks, with 10-14 days of two antibiotics.      If he’s negative, is it GERD or is it an ulcer?                  Can keep him on PPIs if his symptoms resolve, otherwise scope him if you think it’s an ulcer.          If he’s older (&gt; 40-50 years old), definitely scope him because you could be missing a cancer.

Predict the pathway infection/inflammation/exudate/transudate may take within the abdomen, spreading to/from lesser and greater sacs.  Use knowledge of blood supply to GI viscera to determine the extent of ischemia from ligation or obstruction.  Describe the correlation between GI visceral development, blood supply, innervation and lympathic drainage.  Extrapolate the anatomical structures, found on the cadaver and images, to histological, CT and radiographic images in order to interpret clinical findings of a given scenario.Branches of abdominal aortaUNPAIREDspleen, duodenum- L1 -   S uperior Mesenteric -  jejunum, ileum, 2/3 colon- L3 - I nferior Mesenteric - descending, sigmoid, rectum			   &gt; ####TIP: Blood supply travels in mesentery and follows development of gut.

Branches of SMA  Middle Colic:  1st branch coming off the SMA. Supplies transverse colon.   Right Colic: Supplies ascending colon.  Intestinal: Small branches supply the small intestine.   Ileocolic: Supplies cecum, ileum, appendix. Inferior Mesenteric Artery  L3 level, above bifurcation of common iliac artery   Supply to Hindgut structures Descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum.

Hip extension increases umbilical pain and deep pelvic pain is experienced as well.   Umbilical pain means L3  Important: R/O Pregnancy should be the first thing you do.   This is a case of appendicitis.   The patient presented with Psoas Sign           Hip extension stretches the psoas muscle. The appendix is inflamed and is tucked in the pelvic area, attaching itself to the overlying fascia of the psoas muscle. Pulling of the inflamed appendix during extension results in pain. this is individual with inflamed appendix.         The Obturator Sign is another sign of an inflamed appendixThe Colon  Teniae coli are under chronic contraction causing puckering appearance of large intestine. These indentations are known as haustra and are very typical of the large intestine.  Apendices epiploicae are fat tags hanging off the colon. They are very typical of the large intestine as well.

Muscular tube of skeletal muscle that changes to smooth muscle in mid-third, reflecting function.  Non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.  Innervation and blood supply varies along course.  Closely related to the descending aorta, left atrium, left recurrent laryngeal nerve, thoracic duct, azygos vein, bifurcation of trachea and vertebral column.  Pathologies of these neighbouring structures may show as constrictions of the esophagus.  Case Example      Presents to the ER with dyspnea and dysphagia.    Dysphagia has increased over past six months, has lost 30 pounds    Dyspnea for 3 months; coughing produces blood-tinged sputum.    Last few weeks he has become quite hoarse and has a painful swelling over the right clavicle.    Examination        Patient is distressed and emaciated.    Laryngoscopy shows left vocal fold is abducted    CXR → partial destruction of the right clavicle.    Fluoroscopy shows an obstruction at the level of the tracheal bifurcation.    Recall that RLN compression could cause dysphagia.          Left RLN branches around the       Right RLN branches around        Recall that adjacent to the trachea and the bronchi are lymphatic chains that can easily be enlarged.- The respiratory diverticulum and the foregut are originally conjoined.- They separate, forming an esophagotracheal septum, around week 4.- If this doesn’t happen, you can have inappropriate communication between the trachea and the esophagus.Position of the Esophagus in the Mediastinum  The esophagus passes through the thoracic inlet in between the vertebral column and trachea, from C6-T10          In other words, anteriorly to posteriorly, you have the trachea → esophagus → vertebral column.        Laterally, you have the p  Separated from the left atrium by pericardium; descending aorta to the left sideSwerves to the left and assumes a position anterior to the descending aortaPasses through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm into the abdominal cavity at T10 level          Esophageal Hiatus → The opening in the diaphragm, letting the esophagus through.      The right crus of the diaphragm forms a muscular sphincter-like sling, preventing backflow.      This sphincter isn’t particularly strong, because gravity itself prevents backflow.      Other Relationships  The left recurrent nerve lies between the esophagus and the trachea.          So compression between the esophagus and the trachea could result in hoarseness.      Features of the Esophagus  The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube, from C6-T10.  There are 2 layers of muscle running perpendicularly to one another:          Inner circular layer.      Outer longitudinal layer.        This is similar to the ureter, except that with the ureter, you have an inner longitudinal layer, and an outer circular layer.  The muscular composition of the esophagus changes as you go down:          The superior third is skeletal.      The middle third is mixed.      The inferior third is smooth.        In other words, as you go down the esophagus, it changes from a skeletal muscle composition to a smooth muscle composition (which makes sense, since most of the GI tract is smooth muscle).Histology of the EsophagusMucosa• stratified squamous,usually non-keratinizing• Prominent muscularis mucosaSubmucosa: mucous GlandsMuscularis externaAdventitia• loose connective tissue• no serosaSTRATIFIED SQUAMOUS -&gt; SIMPLE COLUMNAR = esophagus to stomach.NOTE CHANGE IN TYPE OF EPITHELIA.There are 4 main regions where the esophagus can be constricted.Either enlargement of another organ or enlargement of a lymph node.1.

Enters diaphragm.The patient died and an autopsy revealed a large cauliflower-like tumor obstructing the lumen of the esophagus.The mass had perforated the trachea and surrounded and compressed it.The left recurrent laryngeal nerve was embedded in the mass. The mediastinal lymph nodes were greatly enlarged and adherent. Both lungs showed signs of scattered nodular metastases. The liver also had round tumors. The destruction of the right clavicle also was found to be cancerous metastasis.Congenital Abnormalities of the Esophagus1. Esophageal AtresiaEA = Esophageal atresiaAtresia = discontinuity.So esophageal atresia = the esophagus isn’t in one piece!TEF = tracheal esophageal fistula.Types of Esophageal Atresia5 types, ABCDE.Most common is C.Pouch actually a little lower in type C.If you did an X-Ray on a baby with a Type-C fistula (CXR + abdo X-ray).Would you see air in the GI tract?A = complete atresia.A called long gap esophageal atresia.Proximal pouch and distal pouch.You can usually count in vertebral bodies how far apart. 3-4 apart at term.CXR + abdo X-ray, should NOT see air in gut.NO CONNECTION TO TRACHEAL TREE.BCDE have fistulas between one of the two pouches and the trachea.Should see air in gut in C though, the distal pouch connects to the trachea!Embryology of Esophageal Atresia  Incidence = 1 in 5000 births  Cause unknown  Usu sporadic  Env teratogens assoc - BCP, thalidomide             Higher in infants of diabetic mothers        Caucasians &gt; Non-caucasians (2:1)             1.26M : 1F        Even worse, low birth weight males don’t do as well as low birth weight females.• Assocanomalies50-70%- Highest with pure EA, lowest with H-type fistula (type E, looks like an H).- CVS (35%) - VSD, tet of Fallot, PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), ASD (atrial septal defect)- GI (24%) - other GI atresias (eg duodenal atresia), malrotation (Midgut malrotation, at risk of twisting?! midgut valvus?!)- GU (20%) - hypospadias, undesc testes, renal abn - Neurologic (10%) - neural tube defects (makes sense, since kind of close to neural tubes)- Skeletal (13%)- VACTERL (25%)	- Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheoesophageal fistula and/or Esophageal atresia, Renal &amp; Radial anomalies and Limb defects.- Trisomies 13, 18, 21LOWER ESOPHAGUS ON LEFT -&gt; Lower = LeftHIGHER ESOPHAGUS ON RIGHT.	- Higher thoracic esophagus on right.	- If you want to fix a problem on the upper esophagus, enter on right.	- But the aortic arch comes out on the right, and goes down the left.	- Right chest, aortic arch in the way.	- Always need to get an echo to know where the arch is.Prenatal Dx with U/S:- Small or absent stomach - Polyhydramnios → baby can’t drink that amniotic fluid.- Dilated upper esophagus → big proximal pouch since nowhere for the fluid to go.Postnatally,- Excessive salivation- Choking, coughing, regurg with 1st feed - Then they try an NG tube.- RN unable to pass NG past 10cmSEE AIR IN GUT, probably Type C.NO AIR IN GUT, probably Type A.What about the other ones with TEFs?In other ones, the proximal pouch is very tiny, since can decompress into trachea.So big proximal pouch = unlikely to be a esophageal fistula.      5 VB distance between the proximal and distal pouch.

Each part has a separate blood supply coming out of the aorta. These travel in the mesentary.  Rotation of the foregut and midgut.  The hindgut opens into the cloaca with the allantois, and will be separated by the urorectal septum (remember this from Embryology of the Kidney).  Lines of fusion of the mesentery create intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal structures.The Foregut, Midgut, and Hindgut  Below is a sagittal view of the developing embryo:  The developing GI tract is a tube suspended by a mesentery (in grey).  This tube has 3 parts:          Foregut supplied by the coeliac artery.      Midgut supplied by the superior mesenteric artery.      Hindgut supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery.            This is useful, because if you know the developmental origin of a specific region, you’ll know it’s blood supply!    LISTEN TO THIS LATER.  The foregut has a ventral and a dorsal mesentery.  The mesenteries help suspend the tube in a big open space.  Developing out of the foregut (in vellow), are some diverticuli, which become the pancreas, gallbladder, and the liver.  Hence, the blood supply of the liver is the coeliac artery!  The hindgut opens into the cloaca, which is a common exit point with the allantois (the urinary system).- Omentum = draping of the mesentery.- LISTEN TO THIS LATER!The ForegutRotation of the Foregut  Both the foregut and the midgut undergo rotation.  Rotation of the foregut especially involves the stomach.          The stomach rotates longitudinally.      The dorsal side curves more rapidly than the ventral side, forming the classic stomach shape.      Then it rotates horizontally, to end up in its final position in the body.        The mesentery that wraps around the stomach then creates a space behind the stomach.   That is the lesser sac.  Everything out there is the greater sac.

	{"title": "Histology of the GI Tract", "text": "Lecture Objectives  With the aid of a diagram, label the different layers of the GI tract.  List the main functions of the GI tract.  Using histological markers, distinguish the following regions of the GI tract, stomach, small intestine, large intestine.  Differentiate between the six cell types in the stomach epithelium and describe one function for each.  List four ways in which the surface area of the intestinal tract is increased for absorption.  Describe the functions of four cell types of the intestinal epithelium.  Name and identify the locations of stem cells in the stomach andintestines.  With the aid of a diagram identify the location of Auerbach’s andMeissner’s nerve plexus.  Describe the function of Auerbach’s and Meissner’s nerve plexus.General Organization of the GI Tract  Functions of the GI Tract include:          Barrier.      Absorption/Digestion.      Secretion: endo-and exocrine.      Motility.        The GI tract is effectively a long tube. Cutting into the tube, there are 4 concentric layers.  Superficially to deeply, we have:  Mucosa          The mucosa changes depending on where we are in the GI tract.        Submucosa          Contain glands that lubricate the mucosa.      Also contains arrangements of nerve plexuses, known as Meissner Plexuses.      These Meissner plexuses innervate the mucosa, and provide sensory function and some motor function.        Muscularis Externa          The muscular external contains two layers of muscle → an outer longitudinal layer and an inner circular layer.                  Recall from Histology of the Urinary Tract that the ureter also has 2 layers of muscle in perpendicular arrangements, except their order is reversed.                    These muscle layers are comprised of smooth muscle, and are innervated by another nerve plexus called Auerbach’s plexus.      These nerve plexuses arise from the autonomic nervous system (the one that we have no direct control over), and are responsible for peristalsis.        Serosa/Adventitia          This is either a layer of dense connective tissue, or a single layer of epithelium (called serosa), depending on the location.        Layers of the GI Tract      Mucosa    Submucosa              Contains glands that lubricate the mucosa.        Also contains Meissner plexuses that innervate the mucosa.              Muscularis Externa              Contains two smooth muscle layers running in different directions → an inner circular layer, and an outer longitudinal layer.        Contains Auerbach’s plexuses which innervate these muscles.        These muscles are responsible for peristalsis.              Serosa/Adventitia  Here you can see the two muscle layers, as well as Auerbach's plexus, which innervates them.The StomachFeatures of the Stomach  The stomach acts as a reservoir and a digestive organ → there is little to no absorption.  The stomach has rugae → folds in the mucosa.  Gastric pits (foveolae) are invaginations in the surface.  The cardiac region releases bicarbonate to neutralize acids from the acidic stomach, protecting the esophagus.Layers of the StomachThe mucosa is split into 3 layers:  Epithelium          Covers the luminal surface of the GI tract.      In the stomach, it forms indentations in the mucosa.        Lamina propria → recall from ITM that this is loose connective tissue.  Muscularis mucosae          A thin layer of smooth muscle separating the submucosa and the mucosa.                  This is important because it is a muscle layer that is independent of the muscularis externa!          This gives the mucosa movement that is separate from that of the muscularis externa.                    Gastric Glands &amp; Gastric Pits  The indentations formed by the epithelium create gastric pits in the mucosa, increasing surface area.  At the bottom of these pits are gastric glands.  These gastric glands release important compounds into the gastric pits, which are critical for stomach function.Function of Gastric Glands &amp; Gastric PitsCells in the Gastric Pit  Surface Mucous Cell          Produce mucin and bicarbonate.      This creates a viscous, alkaline mucous.        Mucous Neck Cell          Produce a more soluble mucous.      Can respond to nervous stimuli (eg. excitement about food).      Cells in the Gastric Gland  Parietal Cell          Produces hydrochloric acid (HCl) in response to gastrin.      Also produces Intrinsic Factor, which, as you recall from Blood, attaches to Vitamin B12.                  Vitamin B12 breaks down quickly in low pH, without being protected by binding to Intrinsic Factor.          Recall that Pernicious Anemia was where you didn’t have a problem with B12 intake, but you had a problem with IF.          The Schilling Test was the classic test for this, but it’s no longer done.                      Enteroendocrine Cell          Entero—, in GI tract, Endocrine—, secretes hormones.      Produces gastrin.      Hence gastrin production by the enteroendocrine cell → HCl production by the parietal cell.      This gastrin is actually released into the extracellular space, and ends up in the bloodstream. It’s not secreted directly into the lumen.        Chief Cell          Called chief cells because they’re abundant.      Produces lipase and pepsinogen.        Cell Types in the Stomach                    Cell Type        Produces        Additional Information                            Surface Mucous Cell        Mucin and Bicarbonate        Creates a viscous, alkaline mucous                    Mucous Neck Cell        Mucin        Creates a more soluble mucous                    Parietal Cell        HCl and IF        Responds to gastrin.                    Enteroendocrine Cell        Gastrin        Gastrin stimulates parietal cell HCl production                    Chief Cell        Lipase and Pepsinogen        Pepsinogen becomes Pepsin in acidic environments            Pepsin Activation  Pepsin is the active form of Pepsinogen, which is activated by HCl.  This means that we need the activity of the parietal cell (produces the HCl), the enteroendocrine cell (produces the gastrin that stimulates parietal cell HCl production), and the chief cell (produces the pepsinogen), in order to produce pepsin.  Since pepsin is a key proteolytic enzyme, the cells of the gastric gland are extremely important in digesting proteins.  Remember      Pepsin is the active form of Pepsinogen, and is activated by HCl.              Pepsinogen is produced by the Chief Cell.        HCl is produced by the Parietal Cell, in response to Gastrin.        Gastrin is produced by the Enteroendocrine Cell.            Histology of Gastric Cells  Surface Mucous Cells          Clear cytoplasm, since they contain lots of clear mucin granules.      Histologically, they are simple columnar epithelium.        Mucous Neck Cell          As we begin to transition from the pit to the gland, the cytoplasm starts to stain darker, and the cell type changes.        Parietal Cells          More eosinophilic.        Enteroendocrine Cells          Hard to distinguish histologically, since they lack differentiating histological markers.      Can be identified with EM, by the fact that they secrete granules into the extracellular space, and not into the lumen.        Chief Cells          More basophilic, since they have lots of enzymes and RER, which stain blue.      Contains zymogens (aka. proenzymes), namely pepsinogen, which is activated to pepsin.      The above image shows both parietal cells and chief cells. As said before, parietal cells are more eosinophilic, while chief cells are more basophilic. Note that the band at the bottom right of the image is the muscularis mucosa &rarr; since the gastric pits are formed by invaginating the mucosa, we're still above the submucosa!  Remember      Parietal Cells are eosinophilic.    Chief Cells are basophilic.  The Small IntestineFeatures of the Small Intestine  The small intestine is unique in the fact that they have surface projections into the lumen.  In the duodenum, there are glands in the submucosa called Brunner’s glands          Brunner’s glands provides the mucous in the small intestine (as opposed to the surface mucous cells and the surface neck cells in the stomach).        In the ileum, there are aggregated lymphoid nodules called Peyer’s patches, which detect antigens, and can mount immune responses.  Remember      The duodenum can be identified by having Brunner’s glands, which provide mucous.    The ileum can be identified by having Peyer’s patches, which sense antigens and mediate immune responses.  Structure of the Small IntestineBecause the small intestine is where most of our food is absorbed, it’s designed structurally to maximize surface area.  The small intestine itself is extremely long and coiled.  The mucosa of the small intestine folds upon itself into coiled rings called plica circularis. These travel circumferentially around the intestine.  On the surface of the mucosa there are surface projections called villi.  The cells on the surface of each villus themselves have projections called microvilli.  On the surface of each microvilli is a glycocalyx, glycosylated transmembrane proteins that form a tree-like network.Hence, the small intestine has been designed to maximize the surface area for absorption from an anatomical level down to a molecular level!TABLE.LISTEN TO THIS LATER…", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/gastrointestinal/2014/09/02/histology-gi-tract.html"},

Anatomy SimulatorIntro Case Presentation  Case Summary      Mr and Mrs Smithers are 51 and 50 years old    Recently moved to London and are seeing a new family doctor    Both generally healthy with normal physical exams and insignificant past medical histories    Hisvfamily history is insignificant    Her family history is notable for colorectal cancer in her father at age 53 and paternal grandmother at age 48    Both willing to undergo all necessary age- appropriate screening exams and tests. The family doctor offers them fecal occult blood which they undergo.    Both sets are OB(-) x3 samples (Occult Blood).    One Year Later      Mr. and Mrs. Smithers return one year later. Mr. Smithers feels fine.    Mrs. Smithers notes a little fatigue and looks a bit pale. Her CBC reveals Iron-deficiency anemia with haemoglobin of 92 and MCV 70. FOBT testing is positive 2/3 samples.    On their next visit, the doctor suggests that they each undergo a screening sigmoidoscopy. They agree. Mr. Smithers has a few diverticulae, and Mrs. Smithers has some internal haemorrhoids.  What do you think might be going on and what would you do?  Occult blood loss could be because of bleeding from her hemorrhoids, or due to a cancer.
