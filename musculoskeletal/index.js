Identify the key features of vertebral column and compare various views of radiographic images.  Identify and describe the joints and ligaments of the vertebralcolumn, including the intervertebral discs, zygopophyseal, sacroiliac joint.  List the muscles that support the back  Describe the Spinal Cord in Relation to the Vertebral Column and the clinical significance.Spinal AnatomyThe vertebral column is made up of a curved series of bones.These bones are held together by ligaments and joints.7 in C12 in thoracic.6 in lumbar6 in sacral (fused to form the sacrum).3-5 coccygeal (fused to form the coccyx, or tailbone).- Vestigial, so the number may vary.Running through the center is the vertebral canal which houses and protects the spinal cord.The vertebral column.Intervertebral disks get thicker and thicker as we move caudally.THERE IS NO INTERVERTEBRAL DISK BETWEEN C1 AND C2.Harder to feel spinous processes in neck because there’s a ligament in between.BETWEEN vertebral bodies ARE INTERVERTEBRAL DISKS.How many processes extend from each vertebral body?	7!?C1 does not have a body. It’s shaped like a ring. Balances the globe, hence known as the atlas.C2 extends into C1, has an extension known as the audentoid process!?!?C7 = vertebra prominens.Normal Curvatures of the Spine  During develpoment, primary ‘C’ shaped curvature of spine: kyphotic curve.  Hence anything like that (kyphosis) = PRIMARY curvature.Lumbar lordosis more prominently in females, hence more butt stick.Excessive = scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis.FEATURES OF THE VERTEBRATypicall vertebra1 = body. (smaller in cervical region, heart shaped in thoracic, kidney shaped in lumbar -&gt; MATCHES THE ORGANS THERE).Body is suspended by 2 stems that project posteriorly (2 = pedicle).Continues as a flattened piece of bone posteriorly called the LAMINA (ie. leaf-like, 3).Between that is the vertebral foramen (all aligned, so form vertebral canal all the way down).5. Suprior articular process + facet.6. Interior articular process + facet.5 and 6 of the two adjacent vertebra interdigitate to form a SYNOVIAL JOINT.At this point lets us to lateral rotation (rotating side to side). NOT BUILT FOR WEIGHT BEARING.7. Facet (zygapophyseal) joint = synovial joint!?!8. Transverse process → project out to the sides (cervical!?!?!) thoracic, has ribs there. Inferiorly, in lumbar, becomes slender (muscles attach). 9. Spinous process (thoracic = downwards? lumbar = horizontal!?)10. Intervertebral disks.Ligaments - Anterior longitudinal ligament along anterior margin, broad ligament, sacrum to foramen magnum!?- Tough ligament, opposing anterior push of vertebrae.- Posterior longitudinal ligament is NOT AS STRONG, sort of fuses with the intervertebral discs posteriorly.- CIRCLED IS FACET JOINT (synovial joint).- Interspinous ligament = more flexible.- Less flexible ligament = supraspinous ligament (longitudinal band surrounding spine?!)- Ligamentum flavum (yellow) = fibrocartilage, between adjacent laminae.	- When would you have to pierce this clinically?	- When accessing the vertebral canal! (spinal tap, epidural).	- Why is this a safe spot? Recall that in the vertebral canal, we also have blood vessels. Most blood vessels are present anteriorly, so less bleeding.- CORRELATE WITH X-RAY IMAGES.AP View, can see spinous process between, pedicels (stalks just posterior to body!?!)Intervertebral Disk (Nutrition)Notochord -&gt; neural tube.Vertebral column forms around neural tube.Notochord gets absorbed into vertebral column, represented as soft part of intervertebral disk.Outside of intervertebral disk, number of sheets of fibrocartilage. In center is gelatinous substance (nucleus pulposus), REMNANT OF NOTOCHORD.No blood supply feeding intervertebral discs themselves, so nutrition to discs are from adjacent vessels.	- In loaded state (seated/standing), intervertebral discs are compressed, forces H2O molecules out, absorbed by surrounding capillaries.	- In unloaded state (lying down), intervertebral discs (nourishment, etc) gushes back into the discs.	- This transmission of fluid in and out explains why you’re taller with some rest.	- 25% of vertebral length is the disk length itself! So this change can be somewhat substantial.- Tear in intervertebral disc is typically posterior (posterior ligament is NOT AS STRONG, recall. Thin band).Due in part to the curvatures of the vertebral column, particularly in the cervical andlumbar regions, the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc is thicker and thereforestronger anteriorly, but thinner and weaker posteriorly. Therefore, when subjected tostresses as in twisting and bending the trunk during weight‐bearing, the posterior, weakerpart of the annulus is much more likely to tear or get disrupted than the stronger anteriorpart, leading to posterior or posterolateral prolapse of the nucleus pulposusLumbar herniation:Push against posterior longitudinal ligament. Can’t pinpoint, since felt through ligament.Push against spinal cord (sciatica). Can test specific nerve, determine level of herniation.CERVICAL REGIONCan’t feel spinous process, between of presence of thick ligament there.Ligamentum nuchae there.What else is different?C1 &amp; C2, no intervertebral disc.C1 = ring shaped, atlas.C2 = tooth like projection into C1, articulating with it. Odontoid process?Edges of body are pushing out and forming hooks at the sides (UNCINATE PROCESS) = C3-C6.	- Intervertebral disc doesn’t go as far, forming a space.	- Known as the Uncocervical joints (of Lushka).	- See pic on right.	- See exposed faces (uncovertebral joints). 	- Why important? In osteoarthritis, this is where osteophytes may occur.The intervertebral discs themselves are SURFACE ANATOMY OF THE BACKPosterior superior iliac spine (L4/L5, ‘dimple’)Erector spinae (just immediately lateral), longitudinal muscles keeping back erect.Trapezius (shoulder shrugger, different bodies).Lat dorsi (wings).Teres major (minor lats, nicknamed as ‘baby lats’, functionally similar to lat dorsi).Deltoid.Extrinsic Muscles of the Back.Superficial to deep:Trapezius and lat dorsi most superficially.Trap comes of occipital bone. C1 all the way to T12.Latissimus dorsi, merge at thoracolumbar fascia (deep fascia of back). Also takes origin from lower 6 spines of thoracic vertebrae. Affects shoulder joint.Deltoid attaches to scapula.On right, taken off trapezius.All muscles that have to do with the shoulder joint.Called extrinsic muscles of the back (not actually involved in movements of the back!?).Levator scapulae (raises scapula).Rhomboids minor and Rhomboids major. Attach to medial margin of scapula.Levator scapulae above level of spine.Rhomboids minor is at level of spine.Rhomboids major below spine.Retracts scapula, keep them close to vertebral column. All 3.Above spine = supraspinatus?!?Below spine = infraspinatus?!?IMPORTANT STUFF:Ligamentum Nuchae is a strong fan‐shaped fibroelastic band stretching from the externaloccipital protuberance down to and between all the seven cervical vertebral spines.First Layer of extrinsic muscles1) Trapezius muscle is flat and triangular in shape. It lies superficially on the back of theneck and thorax and attaches the scapula to the trunk.Nerve Supply ‐ The accessory nerve (cranial nerve 11) and branches from the 3rd and 4thcervical nerves.Actions ‐ raises the scapula, retraction of scapula, depression of scapula, rotation ofscapula so that the glenoid fossa is raised.2) Latissimus Dorsi is a large muscle which passes from the middle of the back to theupper end of the humerus.Nerve Supply ‐ Thoracodorsal nerveActions ‐ Adducts and medially rotates the humerus. Extends the shoulder joint from theflexed position.Second Layer Muscles (these muscles are deep to the trapezius muscle and act on the scapula)The Levator Scapulae and the Rhomboids run from the cervical and upper thoracic vertebraeto the medial aspect of the scapula.Levator Scapulae: Nerve Supply ‐ branches from the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves and the dorsalscapula nerve.Rhomboid Major and Minor form one quadrilateral muscle with the minor lying superiorly.Nerve Supply ‐ dorsal scapular nerve.Actions ‐ the above three muscles act together to elevate and rotate the scapula so that theglenoid fossa is directed downward.ALL SUPPLIED BY BRACHIAL PLEXUS EXCEPT TRAPEZIUS (SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE, Cranial Nerve 11).INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF BACK - Affect vertebral column.- Splenius cervicus (band-aid, around neck, keeps upright).- Long muscle, attaching to ribs, called erector spinae (broadly, as a group).- Work together, but are divided into 3 columns:	- Iliocostalis.	- Longissimus (longitudinal column/band)	- Spinalis (close to spine)	- I LIKE STANDING = muscle used to stand/sit upright.- Diagram also shows nerve supply.	- Posterior rami of spinal nerves.DEEP GROUP OF MUSCLE between transverse process and body!?Filled with deep muscles, known as Transverso-spinalis muscles.Don’t need to know individual names/attachments.But need to know that they manage FINER MOVEMENTS OF FLEXION.Major movement muscle = erector spinae.LATERAL VIEW OF VERTEBRAL COLUMN- See entire spinal cord. (extension of medulla oblongata, foramen magnum!?)- L1/L2 is end of spinal cord?!	- C7 = vertebra proiments.	- The dura mater (dural sac) andarachnoid mater endapproximately at the level of S2vertebra. The subarachnoidspace between the terminationof the spinal cord at L1‐L2 andS2 is referred to as the lumbarcistern and contains the roots ofthe lumbar and sacral spinalnerves which are called thecauda equina because of theirresemblance to a horse’s tail.Meninges = dura + arachnoid mater.Normally can’t separate them, because fluid fills subarachnoid space, and pushes the dura and arachnoid mater.This changes when dead, fluid gone.Hence, call them the ‘dura-arachnoid covering’.Subarachnoid space filled with cerebrospinal fluid.7 cervical vertebrae, but EIGHT cervical nerves.So C1 nerve above C1 vertebrae, and C8 nerve below C7 vertebrae.This shifts all the lower nerves BELOW.	- Hence L3 nerve is BELOW L3, at level of L4!?!C5-T1 = brachial plexus!?! Upper limbs.L1-L4 = lumbar plexus.L45S123 = sacral plexus.Lumbar+ sacral = lower limbs.S234 = pudendal nerve (perineum)S5, and coccygeal nerves.REMEMBERSPINAL CORD STOPS AT L1-L2.EVERYTHING BELOW THAT IS A LARGE SPACE FILLED WITH CSF.DURA MATER AND ARACHNOID EXTEND TO SACRAL AREA THOUGH.The difference is due to differential growth of spinal vertebrae vs. cord. the fluid filled space = LUMBAR CISTERN.Conus medullaris (end of spinal cord).Lumbar puncture/lumbar tap at L4 (around POSTERIOR SUPERIOR ILIAC SPINE, RECALL).IN LUMBAR CISTERN, hence safe since not directly at spinal cord.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/anatomy-spine.html"},
	{"title": "Approach to the Spine", "text": "Lecture Objectives  To introduce basic spine anatomy  To identify clinically relevant spine anatomy  – I.e. understand how anatomy is important to the assessment and diagnosis of spinal pathology.  To correlate spinal anatomy with clinical assessment and radiographic interpretation.Introduction  The spine is a commonly complained about area for patients, doctors, and students.  The spine is an anatomically complex region.  We’ll be focusing on the big picture, rather than the details:          “LEARN THE BIG THINGS RATHER THAN THE DETAILS; this is a generalization that holds good throughout the realm of medicine, and I advise you to evaporate your knowledge not to dryness but to a serviceable bulk. Larger structures, as a rule, are far more important than smaller ones, and moreover will act as guides or ‘rallying‐points’ in calling the latter to mind.” (S.E. Whitnall, 1933)      Anatomic Planes  As we saw in first year:          The sagittal plane splits the body into left and right.      The coronal (frontal) plane splits the body into front and back.      The transverse (axial) plane splits into top and bottom.      Spinal Surface Anatomy  Gives you clues as to what’s going on deeper in the body.  Important landmarks include          C7 = vertebral prominence.                  This is the vertebral bump at the base of your neck.          Useful in localizing an injury to a spinal level.                    L4 = typically at the level of thePIIS *Iliac Crest                  Useful when doing spinal anesthesia (ie. an epidural).The spinal cord from the foramen magenum to L1.Ends at the conus medullaris at L1.The remaining enrve roots come down past the cord and fan out to form the cauda equina.The idea with a spinal is that you want to inject the anesthesia in a place where there’s lots of room (ie. at the cauda equina).	Flexion, canal is larger.Extended, canal is smaller.Therefore have the patient bend forwardSaw this with Type 4 Back Pain.                    The SPinal Cord.  the ‘horses tail’, since they branch out.  Cauda Equina Syndrome → when there’s injury to the cauda equina (eg. via compression or trauma).          Tumour.      Most common cause, disk herniation.      Dermatome vs MyotomeCutaneous distribution of spinal nerves.Dermatome is region on skin that’s covered by a nerve root.eg. T10 = umbilicus.Myotome = motor equivalent of dermatome.Although there’s overlap, not entirely.10 year old girlMVCL3 #, complete L2/L3 paraplegiaMesenteric artery rupture, lumbar puncture, triad!?!Based on localization of spine fracture, and hemorrhagic shock, can localize region of injury and loc’n of blood loss.Functions of the Spine  Structural support and balance for upright posture.  Protects the spinal cord and neural elements.  Mobility.  To achieve these functions:          Must be resistant to axial loading forces.      Must be elastic        Kyphotic and lordoctic sagittal plane curves.  Increased mass of each vertebra from C2 to sacrum.Alternating lordotic and kyphotic curves.Multiple motion segments.MOTION SEGMENT = functional unit of spine	- 2 adjacent vertebrae.	- Intervertebral disc.	- 2 facet joints.- Facet joints allow for the flexion and extension of the spine (see pic).Ligaments of the SpineIMPORTANT ONES:a short band of tough, flexible, fibrous connective tissue that connects two bones or cartilages or holds together a joint.a membranous fold that supports an organ and keeps it in position.A tendon is a fibrous connective tissue which attaches muscle to bone. Tendons may also attach muscles to structures such as the eyeball. A tendon serves to move the bone or structure. A ligament is a fibrous connective tissue which attaches bone to bone, and usually serves to hold structures together and keep them stable.Anterior and Posterior Longitudinal Ligaments (ALL and PLL).- Anterior runs along anterior aspect of vertebral bodies; posterior along post.Both large, important.Supraspinous ligament.Interspinous ligament.Ligamentum Flavum (yellow), STRONGEST LIGAMENT OF SPINE.	Protects elements in the canal.C-spine image.LOSS OF LORDOSIS. (loss of normal contours). This is a clue that there’s somethign else going on.Relative kyphosis.MRI shows white stuff.

Describe the meaning of impairment, disability, and handicap.  Develop alternative approaches to forming the differential diagnosis in MSK disorders.  Integrate some common patterns for MSK disorders from the history into differential formation.  Objective      Learn the importance of history taking in musculoskeletal disorders.    Estimated 90% of the diagnosis is based on accurate history  Likely similar to other clinical areas  Need to form hypothesis on which to base:          Physical exam      Investigations      Treatments        Leads to efficient and effective practice.  Objective      Describe the meaning of impairment, disability, and handicap.    Impairment → ‘Any loss or abnormality of psyhological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function’ (WHO).          Functions at an organ level, ie. a problem involving structure or function (eg. torn achilles tendon).        Disability → ‘An activity limitation that creates a difficulty in the performance, accomplishment, or completion of an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being’ (WHO).          Functions at a person level, ie. failing to do a task or activity (eg. can’t walk up stairs).        Handicap → ‘A disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual (WHO).          Functions at a societal level, eg. unable to work as a bar manager.        Objective      Develop alternative approaches to forming the differential diagnosis in MSK disorders.    Integrate some common patterns for MSK disorders from the history into differential formation.    Some approaches include the following:          Inflammatory vs Degenerative.      Anatomic.      Pain characterization.      Presence of Weakness.      Abnormal Sensation.      Root or peripheral nerve cause.        Inflammatory vs Degenerative          Broadly speaking, MSK disorders can be classified as either inflammatory or degenerative.      Inflammatory disorders will present with pain at rest; degenerative disorders will present with pain with activity.        Degenerative vs Inflammatory Features                    Degenerative        Inflammatory                            Pain with activity        Pain at rest                    May report stiffness        Morning stiffness                    Locking        Swelling                    Instability        Warmth                    May have weakness        Rash                    Swelling? (secondary)        Malaise                             Fever / weight loss / constitutional symptoms              Anatomic          Differential may be highly anatomically based.      Use the ‘generic joint’ → what do all joints have in common?      Apply this to specific joint tissues → ligaments, muscles/tendons, nerves.      Note: # is shorthand for fracture.        Pain Characterization          Pain may be single most common spoken word in musculoskeletal medicine      There are various approaches to take the ‘pain history’ (eg. OPQRST). Another one is ‘OLD CARS’:                  Onset.          Location.          Duration.          Characteristics (quality, severity).          Aggrevating/alleviating.          Radiation.          Symptoms (elsewhere/related).                    Consider the below 4 patients, all presenting with R wrist pain. From the history, we can see that they have very different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis.          Scaphoid Fracture          Rheumatoid Arthritis.          Septic joint.                      Weakness          Weakness is an exceedingly common complaint when pain is involved → if it hurts, you don’t want to move it (hence you have weakness).      Difficulty 1 → is it weakness, or pain, or both?                  Pain without weakness is common.          Painless weakness limits the differential.                    Difficulty 2 → if it’s true weakness, what is causing it? (see possible structures below)        Below are 3 patients, each presenting with foot weakness. Again, they have different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  Tibialis anterior rupture.          Common peroneal neuropathy.          ACA stroke.                      Abnormal Sensation          Abnormal sensation suggests a peripheral nerve injury, which may result in paradoxical sensory changes:                  Increased/spontaneous sensation.          Diminished functional sensation.                    However, tingling and/or outright pain may have a number of causative tissue impairments (eg. nerve, muscle, tendon, bone/joint, referred, etc).      BUT true sensory loss is ALWAYS neurogenic → on P/E, you have to differentiate this from ‘numbness’, which is often vaguely defined by the patient.        Roots vs Peripheral Nerves          Consider the case of a ‘numb thumb’ (frequent tingles, diminished 2-pt discrimination).      Two things in the DDx should include:                  Carpal tunnel syndrome.          C6 Radiculopathy (root level pathology).                    So do we inject their risk, or MRI their neck?      Why are both of these in the differential?                  The C6 nerve root travels down the arm, and becomes the median nerve (which is involved in carpal tunnel syndrome).          The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the thumb, as well as motor innervation to the APB (Abductor Pollicus Brevis muscle at the base of the thumb).          The C6 nerve root also branches into the musculocutaneous nerve, which provides  motor innervation to the biceps.                    Hence, by looking at associated symptoms (eg. biceps weakness), you can help refine your diagnosis!          Root vs. Peripheral Nerve          Nerve roots are not the same as peripheral nerves!      These are similar but not the same; an important concept in MSK/nerve injury.      You must be able to differentiate:                   Dermatome from peripheral nerve territory.          Myotome from peripheral nerve territory.                    For instance, compare the region of innervation of the median nerve (which braches off of C6), and the C6 dermatome (note that these are different):        ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/concepts-musculoskeletal-medicine.html"},
