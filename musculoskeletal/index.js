Case #1  Case Summary  A 65-year-old male presents to you with a history of left knee pain. The pain is dull, has been present for several months, and recently increasing in severity. There is no history of trauma. He is otherwise well. Examination of his knee is normal. You order plain film radiographs (‘X-rays’) of his left knee to rule out any obvious bone abnormality.   Review the radiograph provided and describe the findings.          Radiograph of the distal femur, proximal tibia &amp; fibula.      Lytic, radiolucent, well circumscribed metaphyseal lesion.      The rim is slightly sclerotic.      No growth outside the normal margins of the bone.        What is your differential diagnosis?          Older patient, pain has been increasing in severity, no obvious predisposing factors, so must rule out metastases.      Most common sources of metastases (Prostate, Thyroid, Breast, Lung, Kidney).        Additional Information  You order a bone scan to determine whether this is a solitary lesion versus a multifocal process.  Describe what you see:          Multifocal lesions, makes this more likely to be metastasis (primary tumours will more likely present as a unifocal lesion).      Lymphoma, multiple myeloma.        What is a bone scan?          Radiolabeled technetium is used to look for regions of high bone turnover (where bone is rapidly being destroyed or formed).      Useful when looking for infection or cancer of the bone.        What is a hot spot?          A region of high bone turnover, where more of the radiolabeled agent is taken up.        Given the presence of multiple abnormal foci on the bone scan, what is your differential diagnosis now?          Metastatic carcinoma.      Lymphoma.      Multiple myeloma.        What other investigations might be useful to determine the nature of the lesions?          Biopsy → you need a tissue sample in order to determine the nature of the lesion.      Look for signs of primary cancer:                  Prostate → DRE, PSA.          Thyroid → TSH.          Breast → breast examination, U/S, mammogram.          Lung → CXR.          Kidney → BUN, Cr.                      Describe what you see in the biopsy            Abnormal cells are forming tubular/glandular structures.      Hence, this is suggestive of a glandular cancer; an adenocarcinoma        What is your diagnosis?          Adenocarcinoma.        What cancers, in adults, most commonly metastasize to bone?          PT Barnum Likes Kids.      Prostate, Thyroid, Breast, Lung, Kidney.        By what pathways do these tumours spread to bone?          Hematogenous/lymphangitic spread.      Direct invasion.      Seeding via nerves (especially with prostate cancer, which can invade via the rectal plexus).        Which bones are most commonly affected by metastatic cancer?          Axial skeleton → vertebrae, pelvis, ribs, skull, sternum.      Proximal appendicular skeleton → femur and humerus.      It’s rare to see metastases to the distal appendicular skeleton (hands, feet).        Additional Information  A complete physical examination, including a digital rectal exam, reveals a slightly enlarged, irregular prostate gland with some questionable firm nodularity.  What do you suspect now?          Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.        What can you do to confirm your suspicions?          Serum PSA.      Possibly could to a biopsy of the prostate.        What are treatment options?          Palliative care; the patient already has diffuse metastases, so surgical resection probably won’t help.      Case #2  Case Summary      A 16-year-old male presents to you with a history of left knee pain.    The pain is dull, has been present for several months, and recently increasing in severity. He is otherwise well.    Examination of his left knee reveals a hard, irregular mass.    You order plain film radiographs of his knee.    Describe the findings          Radio-opaque tumour; blastic tumour.      The mass is uneven; some regions are more radio-opaque than others.        What is your differential diagnosis?          The patient is younger, so it’s probably a primary bone tumour (either benign or malignant).      Patient doesn’t have systemic symptoms, so it isn’t osteomyelitis.      The most likely cause is Osteosarcoma.        What do you see in the biopsy?            Really ugly cells here are intertwined with the bone.      The idea here is that the ‘ugly cells’ are trying to make bone.      Hence this is suggestive of an osteosarcoma.        What is the diagnosis?          Osteosarcoma.        What is the treatment?          Generally poor; most patients will have clinically detectable metastases at the time of diagnosis.      Some patients will have to undergo amputation +/- chemotherapy, although we aim to spare the limb when possible.        Who gets this disease? Why?          Most are younger patients (2nd and 3rd decades of life).      Males are more commonly affected.      There’s another peak seen in patients &gt;50; these are often secondary to other causes (Paget’s disease, post-radiation, implants, chronic osteomyelitis).                  These forms of osteosarcomas (secondary osteosarcomas) usually behave more aggressively and do not respond as well to therapy as do osteosarcomas in younger individuals.                    So these are seen in both young and old patients.                  Young patients → primary osteosarcoma.          Older patients → secondary to other causes.                      How is this disease classified?          Not going to be tested on exams.      By location (medullary, surface, cortical).      By association with underlying disease (secondary osteosarcoma).      By histological features, or if it’s a rare inherited form.        What is the prognosis?          Not too great.      Long-term survivals of 60% to 70%.      Case #3  Case Summary      A 15-year-old female injured her knee while rollerblading.    A plain film radiograph was taken in Emergency.    Describe what you see          Lateral radiograph of the knee (distal femur, tibia, fibula, patella).      Radio-opaque mass extending from the metaphyseal surface of the distal humerus (posterior surface).      Seems to be continuous with the bone, well circumscribed.        What is an osteochondroma (exostosis)?          Osteo- → bone.      Chondro- → cartilage.      Oma → benign.      So this is a benign tumour that resembles bone and cartilage.      Most common primary bone tumour.        Who gets osteochondromas? Where do they occur?          Occur in the long bones.      Usually presents in late adolescence and early adulthood. M&gt;F 3:1.      Hereditary multiple osteochondromatosis → genetic disease, will present with osteochondromas in childhood.                  This arises due to a mutation in the EXT gene, which is involved in the synthesis of heparan sulphate, which plays a role in bone formation.                      What is the difference between sessile and pedunculated osteochondromas?          Pedunculated → has a stalk.      Sessile → it’s a bump, no stalk (like speedbumps).        How might patients present with osteochondromas?          Many patients with osteochondromas will present incidentally.      Osteochondromas generally grow slowly, but can present with pain if there’s nerve impingement.      Rarely, they may transform into a malignant tumour, such as a chondrosarcoma. This is more likely with a hereditary syndrome.        What is the treatment?          If asymptomatic, nothing needs to be done.      If symptomatic, surgical resection.      Case #4  Case Summary      A 75-year-old female is referred to you because of a shoulder mass.    The mass is painless and has been gradually increasing in size over the last year and is associated with decreased mobility.    She is otherwise healthy.    A plain film radiograph is obtained.    Describe what you see          Large, destructive, fairly well defined tumour of the proximal humerus.      Destruction of the cortex, extension into the soft tissue.        What is your differential diagnosis?          Chondrosarcoma.      Osteosarcoma.      Metastasis from a primary tumour.        How do you confirm the diagnosis?          Biopsy.        Using clinical-radiographic-pathological correlation, what is the diagnosis?          Given that it’s a central lesion (ie. the hip girdle, shoulder, and pelvis vs. the limbs), large, destructive, and seen in a female, this makes it very likely to be a chondrosarcoma.      Histologically, when we look at the biopsy, we see the formation of bluish nests surrounding pink osteoid.      This is suggestive of cartilage-like cells (which stain bluer).      So this is a Chondrosarcoma.        What is the treatment?          Surgical resection; since most tumours are central, this often involves amputation.      Radiotherapy and chemo are only used for some types of chondrosarcoma, or high grade (poorly differentiated) ones.        Who gets this disease?          Chondrosarcoma is about half as common as osteosarcoma.      Patients who get it are usually 40 or older, M:F = 2:1.        In what bones does this disease occur?          As mentioned before, chondrosarcomas commonly arise in the central portions of the skeleton, such as the pelvis, shoulder, and ribs.        What is the prognosis?          Most chondrosarcomas are low grade, and they have a higher long-term survival than osteosarcomas.      However, they are locally aggressive and can metastasize.      Prognosis varies based on the lesion characteristics, and the treatment approach.

Radiographic analysis of bone tumours.  Work-up of bone tumours.Classification of Bone Tumours  Primary → tumours arising within bone.          Non-neoplastic tumours → reactive/infectious tumours.      Neoplastic → further subclassified based on morphology (what it’s producing), and whether it’s benign or malignant.        Secondary → tumours invading into, or metastasizing to bone.           Most common malignant bone tumour is metastasis!      The most common cancers that metastasize to bone, are (1) Prostate, (2) Thyroid, (3) Breast, (4) Lung, (5) Kidney.      Mnemonic: “P.T. Barnum Loves Kids”.      More common in adult patients.      Will typically presents with slowly progressive pain, and will culminate in a pathologic fracture due to bone damage.        Cancers that Metastasize to Bone      The most common cancers that metastasize to bone are:              Prostate.        Thyroid.        Breast.        Lung.        Kidney.              Mnemonic: “P.T. Barnum Loves Kids”.  Radiographic Analysis of Bone Tumours  Lytic Lesion → loss of bone density (increased blackness, less whiteness).          Radio-lucent, bone destroying.        Blastic Lesion → induction of bone formation (increased whiteness).          Radio-opaque, bone forming.      Bone formation will be diffuse and poorly controlled, and will often look like a ‘cloud of whiteness’.        Multifocal lesions → lesions affecting many regions of bone.          Secondary bone tumours are often multifocal; this makes sense, if the tumour is due to metastases, it’s probably seeded to other areas.      In contrast, primary bone tumours are typically unifocal.      Radiology: Questions to Ask  Where is lesion? What bone? What part?   How large is lesion?  What is lesion doing to bone?  What is bone doing in response?  Is the lesion producing matrix? What kind?   Is the cortex eroded?  Is soft tissue extension present?Examples  Example 1           This is an AP radiograph of the distal tibia and femur. The patient is a child (you can still see the growth plates).      There is a well-circumscribed metaphyseal lesion with a sclerotic margin.      The cortex has a normal contour (there is no ‘bulging’).      As it’s well circumscribed and fairly-non destructive, this seems benign.      These are the typical radiographic features of a non-ossifying fibroma (name isn’t important).        Example 2           Here we see a diaphyseal lesion of some bone (not clearly indicated).      Although there is no patently obvious lesion, there are some important features to note.      Note that there is a peri-osteal reaction on one side of the bone.                  There are many layers of new bone deposition; this is called ‘onion-skinning’          This is a worrisome finding, because it suggests that the periosteum is being irritated by something (often a tumour), and is producing new bone in response..                    In addition, the medullary cavity is more radio-opaque, suggesting that there’s a solid tumour inside.      This is an Ewing’s sarcoma.        Example 3           This is a radiograph of an (adult) knee, showing ballooning of the proximal fibular head.      The cortex is still intact, but is thin, and has swollen.      Bubbles/loculations are visible within the bone.      These are classic findings with a benign bone lesion called an aneurysmal bone cyst.      Clinical presentation of bone tumours  Patients may present for any of the following reasons:          Bone mass.      Soft tissue mass.      Pain → although often patients will have no pain.      Fractures → patients are at risk for pathologic fractures due to bone damage.      Incidental → a bone lesion may be picked up during an XR for something completely different.        The presentation will also differ depending on whether it’s a primary or secondary tumour:          Primary Tumours → rare, can be seen in both young or old patients, will often involve a solitary site, and can involve any bone.      Secondary Tumours → common, usually in elderly, often affects multiple sites, and will usually affect proximal bones and vertebrae.      Work-up of bone tumoursHistory &amp; Physical  History          Age of patient → older, suspect secondary; younger, suspect primary.      Bone involved/part of bone involved       Duration of symptoms/growth rate → A more rapid progression of symptoms would suggest a more aggressive tumour.      Presence or absence of pain.      Mechanical effects of mass.      Hereditary conditions.        Physical Exam          Ensure that the mass originates in the bone (it’s fixed).      Identify the size of the lesion, and how many there are.      Extent of local symptoms during joint motion.      Assess neural function (touch, proprioception).      Assess vascular patency (pulses, skin warmth).      Look for possible signs of an underlying hereditary condition.                  Examples: Cafe au Lait spots or Lisch nodules (seen in NF Type 1).                    Look for signs of primary cancer elsewhere:                  Since the most common cancers that metastasize to bone are Prostate, Thyroid, Breast, Lung, Kidney, assess each.          Prostate → DRE if male.          Thyroid → TSH, thyroid exam.          Breast → Mammogram, U/S.          Lung → CXR, respiratory exam.          Kidney → BUN, Cr.                    Lymph Node Examination → bone tumours, like sarcomas, tend not to metastasize to lymph nodes.                  So if you find positive lymph nodes, it’s less likely to be a bone tumour.                    Investigations  X-ray → unlike with sarcomas, XR is super useful with bone tumours.          Not only are they cheap and quick, they also allow you to assess the biologic potential of the tumour (is it indolent? is it aggressive?).      If the lesion looks borderline, you can even repeat the XR in a few weeks and look for a change.        CT and MRI are less often used, although MRI can be used to look for soft tissue involvement.  CBC, ESR, CRP → infection, inflammation.  Bone Scans → these should be done if you suspect metastases, in order to look for multifocal lesions.  Signs of Primary Tumour:          Prostate → PSA.      Lung → CXR, chest CT.      Breast → U/S, mammogram.        Biopsy          If you suspect an active, aggressive, or malignant lesion, A biopsy MUST be done in order to establish a diagnosis and plan management.      Complications of a biopsy include fracture (especially since the tumour will weaken the bone), infection, and hemorrhage.      Be as atraumatic as possible when performing the biopsy to avoid seeding the tumour.        Summary of Investigations      X-ray    Bone scan if you suspect metastases (eg. older patient).    Look for signs of primary tumour → investigations correspond to the most common cancers that metastasize to bone (Prostate, Breast, Lung, etc).    Biopsy in order to make a diagnosis and plan management.  ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/02/25/bone-tumours.html"},
	{"title": "Soft Tissue Tumours", "text": "  Soft Tissue Tumours Notes      See Soft Tissue Tumours Notes.  Lecture Objectives  General Considerations.  Clinical Evaluation.  Histological Approach to Diagnosis.  Management.  Common Soft Tissue Tumours.General ConsiderationsWhat is Soft Tissue?  Soft Tissue → any tissue that connects, supports, or surround other structures and organs of the body, but isn’t bone.          Basically, everything that’s not in the       All soft tissues are derived from the mesoderm.      Hence, soft tissue tumours are often referred to as ‘mesenchymal’.      Tumours of the soft tissue can be both benign and malignant.      Incidence &amp; Demographics of Soft Tissue Tumours  Benign:malignant → 100:1          Most benign tumours will stay benign; they won’t transform to malignant tumours.      There are however, a few exceptions; one example is neurofibromatosis, where diffuse tumours form.         Sarcoma = malignant soft tissue tumour.          So ‘malignant sarcoma’ is redundant.      The incidence of sarcomas increase with age, much like most other cancers.      Most generally arise in areas where there’s lots of soft tissue, such as the large muscles of the retroperitoneum.      Soft tissue tumours are relatively rare, compared to the ‘big cancers’ (breast, lung, colon, etc).      Estimated New Cases of Cancer by Site (USA, 2000).  How do sarcomas differ from carcinomas?          Recall from ITM that these have different embryological origins.      Sarcoma → malignant smooth muscle tumour.                  Arises from cells of mesodermal origin.                    Carcinoma → malignant epithelial cell tumour.                  Arises from cells of endodermal or ectodermal origin.                    Causes of Soft Tissue Tumours  Environmental causes          Asbestos (mesothelioma), vinyl chloride, herbicides, dioxin, radiation (eg. radiotherapy), foreign materials.      The most common of these is probably radiotherapy; since patients survive much longer after the use of radiotherapy,         Oncogenic Viruses:          HHV8 (Human Herpes Virus 8) → Kaposi’s sarcoma, in immunocompromised patients.      EBV → less common, but also sometimes associated with smooth muscle tumours.        Immunodeficiency States:          Stewart Treves → often seen post-axillary dissection in women who had a mastectomy, chronic lymphedema.                  This is an angiosarcoma (vascular tumour) related to the chronic lymphedema seen post axillary dissection.          Now occurs less commonly because of an increase in breast sparing operations, and more precise and judicious axillary LN dissection.                      Genetic Disposition          Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, aka. Sarcoma, breast, leukemia and adrenal gland (SBLA) syndrome.      Rb → Retinablastoma.      NR → Neurofibromatosis.        The majority of sarcomas have an UNKNOWN etiology.Clinical Evaluation of Soft Tissue TumoursHistory &amp; Physical  Typically presents as a lump.  History          Mass +/- pain, increasing in size      Age, duration, change in size over time      Predispositions/ risk factors        Physical Exam            Location, size, multifocality, involvement of adjacent structures.      Try to determine whether the lesion is superficial or deep:                  Superficial lesions (skin, cutaneous tissue) are more likely to be benign.          Deep lesions (fascia or below) are more likely to be malignant.                    Determine regional lymph node status:                  Carcinomas prefer lymphangitic spread.          Sarcomas prefer hematogenous spread.          So if you see regional lymph node involvement, you would suspect a carcinoma over a sarcoma.                    Investigations  Imaging          XR and U/S don’t give you much information with a suspected soft tissue tumour; XR is only really good for bony lesions.      When you suspect a soft tissue tumour, a CT and/or an MRI are better.        Tissue Sampling          Aim to be as minimally invasive as possible, in order to avoid seeding the tumour.      However, although FNABs are minimally invasive, FNABs are a poor choice, because the diagnostic yield is poor.                  Often it’s difficult to classify the tumour and perform ancillary tests (such as histochemical staining).                    Incisional/excisional biopsies give you more tissue (and more diagnostic power), but are much more invasive, and carry the risk of seeding.                  Incisional biopsy → partial removal of lesion.          Excisional biopsy → compelete removal of lesion with minimal surrounding tissue.                    A core biopsy is the best choice.                  Offers a compromise between the non-invasiveness of a FNAB and the diagnostic power of an incisional/excisional biopsy.                       Remember      When dealing with a suspected soft tissue tumour, the best biopsy method is a core biopsy.    Histopathological Examination          Routine histology (looking at it).      Histochemistry (staining it).      Immunohistochemistry (looking at protein expression).      Cytogenetics, molecular techniques, electron microscopy.        For many of these modalities, sufficient tissue is needed, which is why a core biopsy is superior to a FNAB.Classification of Soft Tissue Tumours  Soft tissue tumours are classfied on a ‘histogenetic’ basis, according to the adult tissue that they most resemble.          In other words, they are classified according to ‘what the tumour is trying to be’.      ‘Histogenetic’ is a bit of a misnomer; they’re classified more by phenotype as opposed to genotype.        As with all tumours, benign tumours are better differentiated:          Benign soft tissue tumours resemble their mature soft tissue counterparts.      Malignant soft tissue tumours have less of a resemblance.      Soft Tissue Tumour Nomenclature  The classification of soft tissue tumours is extremely complicated.  However, the basics of soft tissue nomenclature is as follows.  Recall from ITM that:          ‘-oma’ → tumour.      ‘-sarcoma’ → soft-tissue tumour.         The prefix is assigned according to the soft tissue resemblance.          Lipo- → fat.      Rhabdomyo- → skeletal muscle.      Leiomyo- → smooth muscle.      Fibro- → fibrous tissue.      Neurofibro- → peripheral nerve.        Tumours with mixed phenotypes can have multiple prefixes.Management of Sarcomas  Treatment of Sarcomas:          SURGICAL RESECTION.      (+/-) Radiotherapy      (+/-) Chemotherapy.        In all sarcomas, surgical resection is done, but radiotherapy and chemotherapy may or may not be added depending on the context:          Radiotherapy:                  Almost always done, except for cases where the tumour is intra-abdominal, where radiotherapy is controversial due to fear of affecting the surrounding organs.          It’s important to do the radiotherapy before the surgical resection, but not too early or it’ll affect wound healing.                    Chemotherapy:                  Doesn’t have a role in most soft tissue tumours.          However, it does have a role in select subtypes; one example, which we’ll see later, is rhabdomyosarcoma.          In most cases, it’s only used for unresectable, high-stage disease, as a last ditch effort.                      Remember      Surgery and radiotherapy are the mainstay of treatment for sarcomas.  Common Soft Tissue Tumours  We’ll be talking about 3 specific soft tissue tumours:          Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH) → most common adult sarcoma of the limbs.      Liposarcoma → most common adult sarcoma of the retroperitoneum.      Rhabdomyosarcoma → most common pediatric sarcoma.        Common Soft Tissue Tumours      Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH) is the most common adult sarcoma of the limbs.    Liposarcoma is the most common adult sarcoma of the retroperitoneum.    Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common pediatric sarcoma.  1. Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma  The most common adult sarcoma of the limbs.  The name is a bit of a misnomer; the ‘fibrous histiocyte’ doesn’t exist, but the name persists for historical reasons.  Thought to be the end-stage form of other types of soft tissue tumours; highly undifferentiated.          They do however resemble fibrous cells most, hence the name.        Histological features          Will see poorly differentiated tissue.      Cells will be pleomorphic, will look ‘bizarre’.        Treatment          Wide resection → 1-2 cm margin of normal tissue surrounding the lesion.      Radiotherapy.      CT lungs to r/o lung mets.      F/U with clinical exam and imaging.        Prognosis          MFH has a very high metastatic potential; 40% of patients who present with this already have lung mets.      Hence the 5-year survival is only 50-60%.      2. Liposarcoma  The most common adult sarcoma of the retroperitoneum.          However, it is VERY rare in pediatrics, it’s pretty much exclusive to adults.        This, as the name suggests, is a malignant sarcoma that shows fatty differentiation.          Unlike MFH, which we saw just previously, the cells within a liposarcoma are very well-differentiated.        Can grow to be very large (Guinness World Records large), since they’re often in the abdomen, and have lots of room to grow.  Unlike MFH, liposarcomas very rarely metastasize, even though they are malignant.          The risk instead is actually recurrence.      Liposarcomas have a habit of recurring over and over and over again.        Histological Features          Will resemble adipose tissue.      With immunohistochemical staining, will see MDM2 protein overexpression.        Treatment          Wide resection → 1-2 cm margin of normal tissue surrounding the lesion.      Radiotherapy not done (if retroperitoneal) → this differentiates liposarcomas from MFH; since they’re more likely to be retroperitoneal, radiotherapy is done less frequently.      CT lungs.      F/U with clinical exam and imaging.        Prognosis:          Low risk of metastasis, but frequent local recurrence.      5-year survival quite good.      3. Rhabdomyosarcoma  The most common pediatric sarcoma.  A malignant tumour that resembles skeletal muscle cells.  Incidence wise, this is the opposite of MFH or liposarcoma; these are much more common in children.  Another exception is that, unlike most sarcomas, these can (sometimes) metastasize via local regional lymph nodes.          Recall that most sarcomas spread hematogenously; rhabdomyosarcomas are an exception.        Histological Features          Small round cells that stain blue on routine H&amp;E (hence this is classified as a small-blue-round-cell tumour).      When looking at the tissue organization, you can often see cross-striations, where the tumour cells try to mimic skeletal muscle.      Will often express Desmin, and MyoD1.        Treatment          Wide resection (as before).      Chemotherapy → this is an exception to the rule where most sarcomas do not receive chemotherapy! With rhabdomyosarcoma, we actually use chemo up front.      (+/-) Radiotherapy → may or may not be used depending on tumour size.        Prognosis:          Multimodal therapy (ie. with chemo, with possible radiotherapy) improves survival from 20% to 70%.      The alveolar subtyle has a worse prognosis.

	{"title": "Polyarthritis Small Group", "text": "  Polyarthritis Small Group Cases      See Polyarthritis Small Group Cases.    Polyarthritis Small Group Answers      See Polyarthritis Small Group Answers.  Case #1  Patient History      Identifying Data → John is a 26 year old recently married man with no children.    Presenting Problem → Pain and swelling in many joints.    Past Medical History → John is otherwise healthy.    Current Medications → Ibuprofen 200 mg q4d.    Allergies → none.    History of Presenting Illness:              Over the last three months, John has developed swelling and pain in a number of joints. It began in his right index MCP and PIP and shortly afterwards the left ring DIP, right wrist, and left ankle became involved. He describes two hours of morning stiffness in the swollen joints with a mild reduction in his energy. He is still able to perform his basic activities of daily living and is able to continue working at his job in the stock-room of a local auto-parts dealership.        When asked about previous joint problems he recounts a right 4th toe becoming very painful, red, and swollen one year previously, to the point where he was referred to a local surgeon for treatment of what was felt to be either a cellulitis or an osteomyelitis. The toe had been amputated. He also recalls an episode of left Achilles’ tendonitis several years ago, and recurring problems with what had been diagnosed as plantar fasciitis.              Social History → John does not smoke and drinks occasionally at social gatherings.    Review of Systems → John has itching and scaling in the skin folds behind his ears. He also gets patches of “dry skin” in his scalp. About six months ago John had been under the care of an ophthalmologist for an episode of intense redness and pain in his right eye which cleared up with steroid drops. John denies any problems with his low back.    Family History → John’s father has psoriasis as does his brother. His sister and mom are both healthy.    Physical Examination → John appears well in no obvious distress. Cutaneous examination confirms extensive scaling on an erythematous base behind the ears along with scaly erythematous plaques on the scalp. Multiple nails had pits in them and some of the nails appeared to be lifting off the nail-bed (onycholysis). The involved digits and joints were diffusely swollen, warm to touch, and tender to palpation. The MCP and IP joints have a reddish-purple hue.    List your differential diagnosis for John’s problem          Seronegative Arthritis → Psoriatic Arthritis.                  Recall that there were 4 types of seronegative arthritis:                          Psoriatic Arthritis.              Reactive Arthritis.              Enteropathic Arthritis (history of IBD).              Ankylosing Spondylitis.                                          Rheumatoid Arthritis.      Arthritis associated with viral hepatitis.      SLE is possible.      Viral hepatitis → unlikely due to 3-month history of disease.        Cite those features which strongly support one of those diagnoses.          Most likely to be psoriatic arthritis.      Patient has family history of psoriasis, and seems to have psoriasis himself.      Psoriatic arthritis usually affects younger patients, so John fits the bill.      DIP involvement makes it less likely to be rheumatoid arthritis.      Signs of dactylitis and enthesitis (inflammation of attachments of ligaments and tendons).      Past eye problems are suggestive of iritis.      Nail findings; recall that nail findings with psoriatic arthritis includes:                  Onycholysis → lifting off the nail beds.          Oil-drop sign → yellow discoloration of the nail.          Hyperkeratosis → can be so bad that it can resemble a fungal infection.                      What investigations should be done?          Blood tests &amp; Urinalysis.                  CBC → look for anemia and platelets.          ESR, CRP → look for inflammation.          Creatinine → kidney function (DMARDs can cause renal problems).          AST, ALT, ALP, albumin → liver function (DMARDs can cause liver inflammation).          Hepatitis B&amp;C serology → r/o arthritis associated with hepatitis.          Rheumatoid Factor → by definition, should be negative in psoriatic arthritis (seronegative), but small percentage can have a low grade RF.          ANA → also should be negative since seronegative.                    Radiographs                  Radiograph the involved joints to follow joint damage over time.                      Outline an immediate management plan for the most likely diagnosis.          Refer to rheumatologist.      Non-pharmacologic → education, PT, OT.      Pharmacologic → NSAIDs, steroids, DMARDs, biologics.                  NSAIDs → pain relief, but doesn’t alter course of disease.          Corticosteroids → often used to improve function, and act as a bridge to DMARDs.          DMARDs → need to be used. Monotherapy/double-therapy/triple-therapy can be used depending on disease severity.                    Biologics → TNA-α inhibitors can be used if there’s a failure to respond to DMARD therapy.      Case #2  Patient History      Identifying Data → Pauline is a 42 year old mother of 4. She is married and is working part-time as a medical secretary.    Presenting Problem → Pain and swelling in many joints.    Past Medical History → Pauline is otherwise healthy.    Current Medications → enteric coated aspirin.    Allergies → none.    History of Presenting Illness → Pauline has experienced a gradual progressive pattern of pain, swelling, and stiffness involving the small joints of her hands (MCPs and PIPs), wrists, shoulders, knees, and in the balls of her feet over the last 6 months. She is significantly fatigued requiring a nap each afternoon; she sleeps poorly because of shoulder pain, and each morning requires 30 minutes just to get dressed for work. Her morning stiffness eases around noon. Pauline is finding it increasingly difficult to cope at home. She has taken the last week off work and the house is a mess as she hasn’t been able to clean.    Social History → Pauline does not smoke and drinks occasionally at social gatherings.    Review of Systems → Pauline has had no fevers or chills. Her appetite has been slightly lower and she thinks she might have lost a few pounds. She has noticed “itchiness” and irritation of her eyes and has taken to buying “artificial tears” at the drug store. She keeps a glass of water at her bedside, and quite unusual for her, has had to have four dental caries attended to in the last year. The remaining review of systems was non-contributory.    Family History → Pauline’s father has hypertension and gout and her mother is healthy after recently recovering from breast cancer. Her 3 sisters are healthy. Her children are all healthy.    Physical Examination → Pauline looks tired and uncomfortable. Her blood pressure is 120/80 and she is afebrile. Examination of the eyes appears to show a reduced tear film. Her mouth appears dry with no salivary pool and she has significant halitosis. Her respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal examination is normal. All of the MCPs, PIPs, and both wrists are warm, tender, and swollen with capsular distension. A tight finger tuck is impossible and her grip strength is reduced. Her shoulders and knees exhibit stress pain, and she has large bilateral knee effusions. Her MTPs are thickened and tender when squeezed.    List your differential diagnosis for Pauline’s problem          Rheumatoid Arthritis      Seronegative Arthritis                  Psoriatic Arthritis                    Connective Tissue Disease                  Sjogren’s Syndrome          Systemic Lupus Erythematosus          Mixed Connective Tissue Disease          Scleroderma          Polymyositis.                    Infectious Arthritis → eg. associated with Hep B &amp; C.        Cite those features which strongly support one of those diagnoses.          The most likely diagnosis is Rheumatoid Arthritis for the following reasons:                  Rheumatoid arthritis is more common in women (2.5:1) and tends to occur  between the ages of 30 to 50.          The arthritis began as an inflammatory oligoarthritis and has progressed in an  additive fashion to a polyarthritis which is a typical onset for rheumatoid arthritis. Prolonged morning stiffness, swollen joints, loss of energy, and a decline in day to day functioning are key features of this inflammatory polyarthritis.          The pattern of joint involvement is typical for rheumatoid arthritis being symmetric involving MCPs, PIPs, wrists, shoulders, and knees.          The associated dry eyes (xerophthalmia) and dry mouth (xerostomia) are typical extra-articular features of RA occurring in up to 25% of patients.                      Propose and defend further investigations          Bloodwork &amp; Urinalysis                  As with the previous case:                          CBC, ESR, CRP.              Creatinine.              AST, ALT, ALP, albumin.              Hepatitis B &amp; C serology.                                TSH → rule out other causes of fatigue.          RF → should be positive.          ANA → fairly non-specific, but can help rule out causes.          ENA → Extractable Nuclear Antigen Antibody Panel; look for Abs associated with Sjogren’s.                    Radiographs:                  As before, image the involved joints to get a baseline and to follow joint damage.                      Outline an immediate management plan for the most likely diagnosis.          Refer to a rheumatologist; as mentioned today, will likely have aggressive early treatment with DMARDs.      Non-pharmacologic → treatment, PT, OT.      Pharmacologic:                  NSAIDs → for symptomatic relief, doesn’t change disease progression.          Corticosteroids → to reduce inflammation and increase function.          DMARDs → aggressive therapy early on to try and alter disease course and minimize joint damage.                          Triple Therapy → Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine, Hydroxychloroquine.                                Biologics                          TNF-α antagonists are used first (Etanercept, Infliximab, Adalimumab, etc).              If those fails, non TNF-α antagonists are used (Rituximab, Tocilizumab, Abatacept, etc).                                          Patient #3  Patient History      Identifying Data → Ana is a 17-year-old high school student living at home with her parents.    Presenting Problem → Multiple complaints including joint pain, chest pain, and a rash.    Past Medical History → Ana has otherwise been healthy.    Current Medications → Occasional Ibuprofen (Advil®, Motrin®) for joint pain and minocycline for acne.    Allergies → None.    History of Presenting Illness → Over the past two weeks Ana has had almost constant severe right-sided chest pain, aggravated by movement and deep breathing. For somewhat longer – three months – she has complained of painful stiff fingers, wrists, and knees. Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen haven’t been of much help. She has noted profound fatigue. Early this past summer she broke out in blisters on her arms and cheeks after a trip to the beach, and has avoided direct sun exposure since.    Social History → Ana does not smoke and drinks occasionally with her friends.    Review of Systems → Ana has experienced occasional chills but has not documented a fever. Her appetite and weight have been stable. She admits to noting an increase in hair loss (strands of hair on the pillow each morning) and more frequent mouth sores.    Family History → Ana’s parents are both healthy. Her brother is healthy. There is no history of arthritis in the family.    Physical Examination → Ana appears well. Her blood pressure is 110/70 and she is afebrile. She does exhibit a diffuse erythema over her malar regions, but no areas of discrete alopecia are noted. There are several raw superficial ulcerations in her mouth and on the nasal septum. Chest and cardiovascular examinations are unremarkable. Her fingers are diffusely puffy, with fusiform swelling about the PIP joints of both hands. She cannot make a tight fist. Wrists are swollen, and a “bulge” effusion is detectable in both knees.  Malar rash = acute rash, sun exposed areasDiscoid rash = chronic rash, less sun exposed areas.LUPUS NEPHRITIS.RA vs Lupus, lupus is non-eroding.AT LEAST 4/11 AND AT LEAST 1 OF BOTH CLINICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL.Methotrexate is very effective for inflammatory arthritisBut lupus can cause pancytopenia and affect kidneys, so could be exacerbated with methotrexate. So not first line.Best drug is PACQUINEL. WE DON’T KNOW WHY, BUT BEST!!If fails, use stronger drug, chloroquine?For sake of exam.Pacquinel.Avoid sun.With exception of lupus nephritis by itself, by biopsy, is diagnostic of lupus.MINOCYCLINE CAN CAUSE LUPUS! Get her off of them.Hydralazine can too.Dx by exclusion, so do blood tests to r/o other causes.ANA will likely come back positive, neither RF and ANA are specific.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/02/23/small-groups-polyarthritis.html"},

If it’s been present for more than 6 weeks and hasn’t been getting better.        If your RF and ANA are negative, is it still rheumatoid arthritis?          Yes, it could still be RA.      RF is negative in 50-70% of early cases, she will still need DMARD treatment.      Introduction to DMARDs  DMARDs → Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs.          It’s best to think of these medications as forms of mild chemotherapy.        Typically given to patients as triple therapy; a combination of multiple DMARDs.          Historically, this hasn’t been the case. Because of worries of side-effects with ‘mild chemotherapy’, we usually waited until the symptoms became quite severe.      However, now we aim to treat much earlier, with multiple agents in order to increase effectiveness.      Triple therapy is classically described as:                  Methotrexate          Sulfasalazine.          Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)                    Sometimes Leflunomide is added (quadruple therapy).      More recently, there’s a push to use methotrexate with biologics instead (depending on patient drug coverage, since biologics are $$$).        Why do we treat earlier now?          This has been a paradigm shift in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis.      This is mainly because joint damage is an early phenomenon of rheumatoid arthritis; if you wait until the inflammation gets worse, the joint damage may already be done!                  Joint erosions occur in 93% of patients with less than 2 years of disease activity.          The rate of radiographic progression is greatest in the first 2 yeras.                    There’s also a ‘window of opportunity’ where, if we treat heavily enough, we can actually get the disease in remission.                  This has made the tradeoff with side-effects more bearable.                      Remember      Joint damage occurs early on with RA, so DMARD therapy is given earlier.    It’s thought that strong treatment early on can put the disease into remission.  What are some types of DMARDs?  The main DMARDs are:          Methotrexate      Sulfasalazine (Salazopyrin©).      Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil©)      Leflunomide (Arava©)        Other DMARDs, which are used less frequently, are:          Gold (Myochrisine©)      Cyclosporine, Azathioprine, Cyclophosphamide.        Common Drug Therapies:          Triple Therapy → Methotrexate + Sulfasalazine + Hydroxychloroquine.      Double Therapy:                  Methotrexate &amp; Leflunomide.          Methotrexate &amp; Sulfasalazine.          Methotrexate &amp; Hydroxychloroquine .          Methotrexate &amp; Gold.          Sulfasalazine &amp; Plaquenil.                    Monotherapy        Of these, triple therapy is used (by far) the most.Methotrexate  Objective      How does methotrexate work?    Mechanism of action:          Similarity in structure between folate and methotrexate.      Competitive inhibitor of THF, interferes with purine synthesis, and thus rapidly dividing cells.      Side effects relate to this; affects hair and serosa.      Doesn’t work right away; takes 6-8 weeks to start working.      Dose and Administration  Dose ranges from 7.5 to 25 mg ONLY GIVEN ONCE A WEEK 2.5 mg Tablets or Subcutaneous Injection 25 mg/mL Onset of Action  6-8 weeks Avoid Pregnancy – Teratogenic Alcohol Sulfa Antibiotics (Sulfasalazine is ok)Why is alcohol contraindicated?

	{"title": "Connective Tissue Disorders I", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Connective Tissue Disorders          To understand what is an autoimmune connective tissue disease         Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)          What are the more common clinical features that might suggest a patient has SLE?      What investigations would you send a patient with suspected SLE for?      What investigations should a patient with diagnosed SLE have routinely monitored?      What clinical/laboratory features of SLE should be taken very seriously as they may indicate a relative emergent flare of disease?      What non-pharmacologic modalities in SLE?      Why is hydroxychloroquine (plaquenil) used so frequently in SLE?      What pharmacologic modalities in SLE are used to treat      Minor and major organ involvement        Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome           Know what it is.      What is Connective Tissue?  A connective tissue can be defined as a tissue which supports, connects or separate tissues or organs in the body.  Comprised of cells scattered in an extra-cellular matrix.  Matrix is composed of mainly collagen, elastin, and reticular fibers.  Since almost every organ in the body has supporting connective tissues, a connective tissue disease can affect many different organs.What is Connective Tissue Disease?  We’ve seen some examples of genetic connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan’s Syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.          However, today we’ll be focusing on autoimmune connective tissue disorders.        Connective Tissue Disease (autoimmune) → a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by autoimmune-mediated inflammation of connective tissues.          End result of inflammation can be scarring (fibrosis) and damage to the tissue.      This autoimmune attack also results in accelerated atherosclerosis of the blood vessels; hence CTDs can result in cardiac problems.        Examples of CTDs include:          Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) → affects 1 in 1000.      Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) → affects 1 in 10,000.      Sjogren’s Syndrome (SS) → affects 2 in 10,000.      Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis → affects 1 in 100,000.      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus22 year old college student New onset of Red rash on the cheeks (malar rash) Hives in the sun Fatigue, Hands turning white in the cold (Raynaud’s) Weight loss Hair loss Stiff hands in the morning Her cousin has JRAJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), is the most common form of arthritis in children and adolescents.

What is most likely?SLERheumatoid arthritis.Mixed connective tissue disease.Criteria for SLE  These are ‘classification’ criteria for SLE, developed by:          The American College of Rheumatology (ACR)      The SLICC (SLE International Co-operating Clinics)        These criteria were intended as a means for standardizing patient populations for the purpose of clinical research rather than a diagnostic tool.          In other words, it’s aimed to be very specific, but may not be completely sensitive.      Hence, not all patients with SLE will satisfy this criteria.        To be classified as SLE, you need to satisfy the following:          Symptom duration of &gt; 6 weeks.      Presence of at least 4/11 of the following criteria.        Criteria for SLE:          Malar Rash                   Photosensitive erythema, flat or raised, over the malar eminences.          Presenting feature in less than 1/3 of patients with SLE.          Spares the nasolabial folds → ie. the smile lines under your cheeks.          Involvement of the nasolabial folds (and rhinophyma) will make a rash more suggestive of rosacea over SLE.                     Discoid Rash                   This is a circular rash, with central scarring.          This can be differentiated from a ringworm rash in that the centre will be clear with a ringworm, but will be scarred with SLE.                      Mnemonic → ‘MD SOAP BRAIN’:          M → Malar Rash.      D → Discoid Scars.      S → Serositis.

What is an ANCA, what are the two types, and what diseases is it associated with?      What antibodies are c-ANCA and p-ANCA a result of?      Why do some patients with connective tissue disorders and vasculitis have a low complement level?      Synovial Fluid  Produced by the synovial lining cells, and helps the surfaces of the cartilage slide together.  Normally there’s only a few mL of fluid in the joint, but production increases with inflammation of the synovium.  A joint should always be aspirated for fluid when you see an acute, hot, red joint.  Objective      What routine tests should synovial fluid be sent for?    3 C’s and a G.          Cell Count &amp; Differential.      Crystals.      Culture &amp; Sensitivity.      Gram Stain.        This is ALL you ever test synovial fluid for; if you’re ever asked to test protein, or RF, or anything like that, it’s useless!  Objective      What is the difference between normal, non-inflammatory, and inflammatory synovial fluid?    Normal Fluid → clear and straw coloured fluid.          Viscous like “egg-white”.        Non-Inflammatory Fluid → remains clear.          Viscous like “egg white”.        Inflammatory/Infectious Fluid → becomes cloudy to opaque, depending on the cell count.          Becomes more watery; inflammation increases the water content of the fluid, making it less viscous.      In an obvious infection, it may look like pus.      Can be caused by infection, gout/pseudogout, or an autoimmune reaction.        Findings on Cell Count:          Normal Fluid →  cells/Litre.      Non-Inflammatory Fluid →  cells/Litre.      Inflammatory Fluid  →  cells/Litre.      Infectious Fluid → with an infection, the cell count can rise as high as  cells/Litre!        Findings on Cell Differential:          Normal Fluid → &lt; 25% PMNs (Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils).      Non-inflammatory Fluid → &lt; 25% PMNs.      Inflammatory/Infectious Fluids → &gt;75% PMNs.        Findings with Crystals:          If inflammation caused by gout → monosodium urate.      If inflammation caused by CPPD → calcium pyrophosphate.                  CPPD → Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disorder.          Leads to both pseudogout and chondrocalcinosis.

In other words, how do we differentiate an inflammatory vs degenerative cause?      We can look for serologic markers of systemic inflammation!        Serologic Markers of Inflammation:          CBC → Hb, WBC, Plt.      Acute Phase Reactants (ARPs) → ESR, CRP, Ferritin, complement, immunoglobulins.        Objective      What are the common serologic abnormalities which reveal an “inflammatory picture”?  Findings on the CBC  Hb → may see normocytic anemia with chronic inflammation. Recall, this was Anemia of Chronic Inflammation, which we saw in Blood!  WBC → infectious/crystalline causes of inflammation may result in increased WBC levels.          However, in inflammatory diseases like RA, WBCs will often be normal.      In SLE, the WBC can actually be low, because there are antibodies against the WBCs themselves!        Plt → will increase in inflammatory diseases, ie. reactive thrombocytosis.          In overwhelming infection (sepsis) however, one can see a significant drop in platelets, due to diffuse coagulation.        Remember      WBC only rises in infectious/crystalline causes of inflammation.    WBC should be normal with RA, and may even fall in diseases like lupus.  Findings on CBC                   Non-Inflammatory      Inflammatory                  Hemoglobin      Normal      &darr; (Normocytic Anemia)              WBCs      Normal            				Will &uarr; if infectious cause			Will be NORMAL if RA.			Can &darr; if SLE      		                 Platelets      Normal            	      		&uarr; with reactive Thrombocytosis      		&darr; with sepsis      	            Findings with Acute Phase Reactants  Acute Phase Reactant → a protein that either rises or falls acutely, in response to a stimulation.          For instance, albumin and transferrin will fall in response to inflammation, while ESR and CRP will rise.      The 2 ARPs that we’ll be focusing on are ESR and CRP.        Objective      What is an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)?  1. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)  ESR → a measure of how quickly our blood ‘sediments’.  Initially developed as a serologic test for pregnancy, but it was later found to be a useful non-specific marker of inflammation.  The ESR isn’t a fancy test; you could do it at home!            Put a 200 mm long x 2.5 mm diameter tube of anticoagulated blood in a room.      Set a timer for an hour.      Look at how far the column of blood has fallen in an hour (mm/hr).      Normal ESR                  Men → Age/2.          Women → (Age + 10)/2.                      Why is this an inflammatory marker?          Forces affecting the sedimentation of RBCs:                  The size of the RBCs.          Viscosity of the plasma.          Repellant forces between negatively charged RBC membranes.                      The presence of asymmetric positively charged proteins (eg. fibrinogen), which is produced with inflammation, affects the repellant force between these RBCs.      These proteins allow for clumping of RBCs, allowing them to form rouleaux.      This allows for the RBCs to settle more rapidly.                  Hence, with inflammation, your blood sediments more rapidly!                      We saw a condition which resulted in rouleaux formation in Blood as well → Multiple Myeloma          With multiple myeloma, which was a cancer of the plasma cells, the sharp increase in IgG antibodies also mediates rouleaux formation.      Hence, the ESR is very non-specific; it can rise with hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia (recall that albumin is negatively charged), pregnancy, or with tissue necrosis.        Objective      What is a C-Reactive Protein (CRP)?  2. C-Reactive Protein (CRP)  CRP → an inflammatory protein produced by the liver under the stimulus of interleukin-6          Function → able to bind to the surface of microbes and improve their removal from the body.      Hence, during infection or inflammation, CRP increases in order to remove foreign microbes.      Note that ESR is an indirect marker of inflammation, while CRP is a more direct marker; hence they’re not equivalent.      Different things can affect CRP versus ESR.        CRP Reference Ranges (not important):          Most normal people →  ().      Normal range →  ().      Inflammation →  ().      Rheumatoid Factor  Objective      Simplistically, what is the basic immunologic structure of a rheumatoid factor?    Rheumatoid Factors → Auto-antibodies directed against antigenic determinants on the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin (Ig) G molecules          Can be IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE (IgM only routinely tested for).      See previous lecture → Rheumatoid Arthritis.        How do we measure Rheumatoid Factor          Latex Agglutination → HISTORICAL METHOD.                  This involved the use of latex particles coated with human IgG, which would agglutinate when patient serum was added.          If there were antibodies against the IgG coated particles, then they would cause the latex particules to clump.                    Nephelometry → CURRENT METHOD.                   More sensitive than latex agglutination.          Measures the amount of scattered light when you shine a light source on the tube with the antibody-antigen complexes.          Clumping would result in increased light scattering; in other words .                      Objective      Is a rheumatoid factor is necessary to make a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis?    How many patients with early RA and with established RA will have a rheumatoid factor?    RF is NOT USEFUL in diagnosing Rheumatoid Arthritis:          Recall that only 30-50% of patients with early RA have a positive RF.      Only 70-85% of patients with established RA have a postiive RF.      So even if the patient has a negative RF, if they fit the clinical picture, then it’s still possible that they have it!        RF does not precisely predict who will get RA:          Asymptomatic people who happen to be RF positive are unlikely to develop RA.      However, if you have a very high RF, you are at increased risk.        Objective      What does the presence of a rheumatoid factor in rheumatoid arthritis actually mean?    RF does predict disease severity:          Between 2 patients with RA, the one with the higher RF will be more likely to have an aggressive joint disease and extra-articular manifestations.      Recall that extra-articular manifestations included Sicca features, Raynaud’s, CTS, rheumatoid nodules, rheumatoid vasculitis, and pleural effusions.        Following titres in someone with RA is not important:          Levels of RF do not predict a flare.      Levels of RF do not predict improvement.      So repeat RFs are useless!        Objective      In what rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases is a rheumatoid factor present?    RF is very non-specific; it’s seen in a number of other conditions:          Rheumatic → Sjogren’s, SLE, MCTD, etc.      Non-rheumatic → Infection, Sacroidosis, IPF.      Note that increases in RF are NOT SEEN IN NORMAL AGING; this is commonly seen in texts, but it’s not true!      Anti-Nuclear Antibodies  Objective      Why is an anti-nuclear antibody a screening test for antibodies directed at “something” in the nucleus?    Anti-Nuclear Antibodies are antibodies directed against “something” in the nucleus          However, it’s not particularly specific because there are thousands of potential antigens in the nucleus.      An ANA test is looking to tell you is there an antibody directed at any one of these potential antigens.      It is a screening test; it’s positive in a lot of the normal population!        So when are ANAs important?          Since ANAs are so non-specific (you see them in so many people), why is it still a useful test?      High levels of ANA are important → high titres are more significant.      Strongly bound ANAs are important → unfortunately, there’s no way of measuring this.      “ANAs are like boyfriends or girlfriends. You only get in trouble when you have (1) lots of them, or (2) when they’re really clingy”.        Objective      What are ds-DNA antibodies and the antibodies in the ENA panel anti-nuclear antibodies?    Some ANAs are more important than others:          Recall that ANAs → any antibody directed at anything in the nucleus.      We also have tests that can look for some specific, important ANAs:                  ds-DNA → antibodies directed against your double-stranded DNA.          ENAs (Extractable Nuclear Antigens) → a panel of antibodies that are also more significant ANAs (ENAs are assessed with suspected lupus).                          There are 6 antibodies included in the ENA panel: Ro, La, Smith, RNP, Scl 70, Jo-1.                                            If the ANA is negative, you shouldn’t be ordering these tests!          Obviously, the ds-DNA and the ENA are SUBTYPES of the ANA, so if the ANA is negative, these are negative by definition!      It’s the equivalent of scouring a lake for fish, and upon finding none, trying to look for bass → very stupid.        How do you measure the ANA?          Not too important; won’t be tested.      Basically involves using a slide covered with cells, and exposing them to the patient serum.      If ANAs bind to the nuclei of these cells, these can then be detected with fluorescently tagged antibodies against these antibodies.      Since ANAs are measured by looking for fluorescence with a microscope, it’s operator dependent (why don’t use software to do this? beats me).      You repeat this test with progressively more dilute patient serum samples, until fluorescence cannot be detected. This gives you a measure of how high the ANA levels were.      Any dilution &gt; 1:320 is important to assess.          Fluorescence patterns with ANA:          Because ANA is assessed fluorescently, you can also see the pattern of antibody binding.      This results in 6 archetypical fluorescence patterns:                    Homogenous → most benign pattern, also most common.          Rim Enhanced          Speckled → more worrying pattern.          Nucleolar          Centromere          Cytoplasmic                      Objective      What rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases can the ANA be present in?  Diseases associated with +ve ANA            Disease      Percentage with a (+) ANA                  Drug-Induced Lupus      100%              Chronic Active Hepatitis      100%              Systemic Lupus Erythematosus      99%              Systemic Sclerosis      95%              Mixed Connective Tissue Disease      95-99%              Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis      90%              Sjogren’s Syndrome      80%              Rheumatoid Arthritis      60%              Myasthenia Gravis      50%              Diabetes      25%        Objective      Are patients with a negative ANA unlikely to have systemic lupus erythematosus?    A NEGATIVE ANA is very effective at ruling out Lupus:          Since basically 100% of patients with lupus have a positive ANA, if you get a negative ANA with a suspected patient, they don’t have lupus.      Hence, since ANA is so specific, it’s very good at ruling out diseases!      Other Antibodies1. Anti-Double Stranded DNA  Anti-ds-DNA (often referred to as ds-DNA), is a specific ANA that’s very specific for Lupus.          So unlike ANA, which is sensitive but not specific, ds-DNA is very specific!      As mentioned before, if the ANA is negative, the ds-DNA will be negative.      Always do the ANA first, and if that’s positive, then do the ds-DNA!        Objective      Do all patients with SLE have to have a positive ds-DNA?    If a patient has a high-titer positive ds-DNA then they are likely to have SLE (&gt;90%)          However, a negative ds-DNA does not rule out SLE.      In London only about 50% with definite SLE have a positive ds-DNA.                  In literature, this ranges from 60-83%.                    In some patients with SLE, rising titers of ds-DNA may be associated with a flare.      2. Extractable Nuclear Antigens  ENAs were another subset of ANAs, as mentioned previously.          These are 6 antibodies which correlate to a higher degree with certain disease states.      So, as mentioned before, if ANA is negative, ENA is negative.        The 6 antibodies in the ENA panel are:          Ro (SSA).      La (SSB).      Smith (Sm).      RNP      Scl 70 (Topoisomerase-I).      Jo-1 (Histidyl tRNA-syntetase).        When you do an ENA test, they’ll first look for the presence/absence of any of the ENAs, and if any are present, they will then do the levels.  The disease associations for each antibody are listed below (YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW THIS FOR THE EXAM).  ENA Disease Associations                    Antibody        Disease Association                            SSA/Ro        SS, SCLE, NLE, SLE                    SSB/La        SS, SCLE, NLE, SLE                    Smith (Sm)        SLE                    RNP        MCTD, SLE                    Scl 70 (Topoisomerase-I)        Diffuse SSc                    Jo-1 (Histidyl-tRNA-synthetase)        PM/DM                  SS → Sjogren’s Syndrome.    SCLE → Subacute Cutaneous Lupus.    NLE → Neonatal Lupus.    MCTD → Mixed Connective Tissue Disease.    SSc → Systemic Sclerosis.    PM → Polymyositis.    DM → Dermatomyositis.  3. Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody  Objective      What is an ANCA, what are the two types, and what diseases is it associated with?    ANCAs → Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies.          These are a collection of antibodies directed against components of neutrophil granules.      These are related to vasculitis; a strong ANCA is a good surrogate marker of small vessel vasculitis.      However, the diagnosis of this must be confirmed by histopathologic findings on biopsy.        There are 2 types of ANCAs          c-ANCA.      p-ANCA.        As we saw a very long time ago, in GU, these were associated with the Classical Systemic Vasculitis Diseases, which could cause nephritic syndrome:          Wegener’s Granulomatosis → c-ANCA                  Recall that this was renamed to GPA: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis; one of the reasons was because Dr. Friedrich Wegener was a nazi, and may have experimented on concentration camp inmates.                    Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) → p-ANCA.      Churg-Strauss Syndrome (CSS) → c-ANCA or p-ANCA.                  As with Wegener’s this was renamed to EGPA: Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, although neither of these physicians were as controversial.                      Remember      Wegener’s Granulomatosis → c-ANCA.    Microscopic Polyangiitis → p-ANCA.    Churg-Strauss → c-ANCA or p-ANCA.    Of these, the scariest (ie. most predictive), is c-ANCAs for Wegener’s.    However, these disease associations aren’t completely sensitive or specific.          c-ANCA is 98% specific for Wegener’s, but is only 40-95% sensitive depending on disedase activity.      This is similar with the other vasculitides.      Hence, although strong ANCA activity is a good surrogate, it must fit within a good clinical context.      As mentioned before, the only definitive diagnosis is by biopsy.        Objective      What antibodies are c-ANCA and p-ANCA a result of?    c-ANCA → caused by anti-proteinase 3 (PR3).  p-ANCA → caused by anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO).  In London hospitals now, c-ANCA and p-ANCA are reported as PR3 and MPO respectively.4. Complement  It is named “complement system” because it was first identified as a heat-labile component of serum that “complemented” antibodies in the killing of bacteria.          It is now known that it consists of over 30 proteins and contributes 3 g/L to overall serum protein quantities.        There are 2 pathways through which it’s activated:            Classical Pathway → activated through antibody binding to foreign material.      Alternative Pathway → activated through binding of one specific complement protein (C3b) to foreign material.                  The alternative pathway is actually downstream of the classical pathway; activation of the classical pathway involves the proteins of the alternative pathway.                    The ultimate result of the complement system is the activation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC).        The complement system has a number of functions:          Opsonization → enhances phagocytosis.      Chemotaxis → attracts other inflammatory cells.      Increases vasodilation &amp; permeability → allows other inflammatory cells to enter a region more easily.      Cellular lysis → activation of the MAC helps destroy offending cells.        Objective      Why do some patients with connective tissue disorders and vasculitis have a low complement level?    Complement is important to measure because it can be INAPPROPRIATELY expended in some diseases:          For instance, in SLE (lupus, which is a connective tissue disorder), the body’s immune system becomes confused, and actually attacks healthy tissue.      Since auto-antibodies are formed, when these antibodies bind to our tissue, it can activate the complement system via the classical pathway.      This results in the consumption of complement proteins, as they’re being used to attack our own body. This is reflected in a low complement.      As a result, we always measure complement levels in diseases like SLE.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/02/18/rheumatology-labs.html"},

What joints does rheumatoid arthritis have a predilection for?  What age range of people does rheumatoid arthritis affect?  Describe a prototypical patient with inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, including what type of people usually develop it, how the disease typically starts, what joints it affects, how it progresses, and what constitutional features are present?  Why should suspected rheumatoid arthritis be referred early?  What blood-tests should be ordered when suspecting a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and why?  How does the philosophy of DMARD/biologic use differ from NSAID/steroid use in rheumatoid arthritis? Why early therapy is important?  Objective      What age range of people does rheumatoid arthritis affect?    Anyone can get RA.          It can be seen in babies to the very old.        Common age to start → 20’s to 50’s.  Sex → F&gt;M 3:1.  Objective      How does rheumatoid arthritis usually start in the majority of patients? How does it start in the minority?    How does RA start?          70% of patients → RA starts off slowly (insidious) over weeks to months, and progresses in an additive fashion.      20% of patients → comes on over a few weeks (subacute).      10% of patients (rare) → comes on overnight (acute).      Can sometimes have a palindromic presentation; this is a pattern where a joint will swell and then go back to normal, and after a variable number of days, a different joint will swell.                  This is different from an additive presentation, where the swollen joints add on.          Here, different joints swell, but then go back to normal.                      Objective      What joints does rheumatoid arthritis have a predilection for?    RA usually begins as an oligoarticular (≤4 joints), and then progresses to polyarticular involvement.  It has a predilection for the small joints of the hands and feet.  In specific, as we saw before, it has the following patterns:          Sparing of the DIPs, involvement of the MCPs and PIPs.      Can have involvement of all of the joints of the limbs → wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles.      Joints are usually swollen and warm, but they will not be red (although they may be a bit purple).        Objective      Describe a prototypical patient with inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, including what type of people usually develop it, how the disease typically starts, what joints it affects, how it progresses, and what constitutional features are present?    Features seen in general inflammatory arthritis were seen in the previous lecture.          Features specific to Rheumatoid arthritis are discussed below.        Features of Rheumatoid Arthritis:          Morning stiffness → prominent feature, &gt;1 hour (recall previous lecture).      Oftentimes this can last all day, so the best way to obtain the duration is “how long does it take until you are the best you are going to be?”.      Symptoms improve with activity → this is because the fluid surrounding the joints gets absorbed as the patients move.      Fatigue → VERY COMMON.      Sleep Disturbance → VERY COMMON.      Other constitutional symptoms like fever or systemic weight loss are rare though.        Extra-Articular Features of Rheumatoid Arthritis:          Xerophthalmia → Dry eyes.      Xerostomia → Dry mouth.      Raynaud’s Phenomenon → characteristic colour changes in the distal digits when exposed to the cold.                  This is due to impaired distal circulation.          After being re-exposed to warmth, these joints can then turn red, due to subsequent hyperperfusion.                    Carpal Tunnel Syndrome      Pleural Effusion → typically unilateral.      Rheumatoid Nodules → can occur anywhere, including over the DIP joints; don’t mistake this for actual DIP joint involvement!      Rheumatoid Vasculitis → bad complication; inflammation of small blood vessels in long-standing RA.        Xerostomia and Xeropthalmia are known as Sicca features (sicca- means dry).          These are classically found in Sjogren’s syndrome, but RA can lead to a “Secondary Sjogren’s.”        Extra-articular Manifestations of RA      Sicca Features → Xerostomia, Xerophthalmia.    Raynaud’s Phenomenon.    Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.    Rheumatoid Nodules.    Pleural Effusions.    Rheumatoid Vasculitis.    Objective      What blood-tests should be ordered when suspecting a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and why?    CBC, ESR, CRP → look for signs of inflammation.  Urinalysis, Creatinine → assess KIDNEY FUNCTION.  AST, ALT, ALP, Albumin → assess LIVER FUNCTION.          We need to assess both kidney and liver function because our drugs (DMARDs) can cause liver inflammation and renal damage.        Hepatitis B&amp;C Testing          To rule out viral arthritis caused by Hep B&amp;C.      We also do it because liver inflammation caused by hepatitis + liver inflammation caused by DMARDs = really bad.        Anti-Nuclear Antibody → often seen in autoimmune diseases, but is very non-specific.          In women particularly, it’s very common to have a positive ANA and be completely normal.        Rheumatoid Factor            Recall from I&amp;I that our IgG antibodies have 1 Fc (constant) portion, and 2 Fab (antigen binding) portions.      Rheumatoid factors are IgM autoantibodies (shown in blue) that are directed against the Fc portion of our IgG antibodies (shown in orange).      In other words, rheumatoid factors are IgM antibodies against IgG antibodies.      Their role in RA is not understood, but we know that they’re there.      RF is very non-specific; it’s seen in a number of other conditions:                  Rheumatic → Sjogren’s, SLE, MCTD, etc.          Non-rheumatic → Infection, Sacroidosis, IPF.                      Blood Tests with Suspected RA      CBC, ESR, CRP → look for signs of inflammation.    Urinalysis, Creatinine → assess kidney function.    AST, ALT, ALP, Albumin → assess liver function.    Hepatitis B&amp;C Testing.    ANA.    Rheumatoid Factor.  Notes on Rheumatoid Factor  What percentage of new onset RA will have a positive RA?          30-50%.        What percentage of established RA will have a positive RA?          70-85%.        Hence, RF IS NOT USEFUL FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF RA.  In addition, asymptomatic people with positive RF are unlikely to go on to develop RA.  However, the higher the RF value, the greater the likelihood of rheumatic disease.          Hence, RF IS USEFUL FOR PROGNOSIS; patients who are RF+ are more likely to have aggressive disease.      It’s NOT USEFUL TO FOLLOW TITRES though; an increase in RF isn’t predictive of a flare, and a decrease in RF isn’t predictive of improvement.        Key Points on Rheumatoid Factor      RF → IgM autoantibodies against the Fc component of IgG antibodies.    Not useful for diagnosis → often seen in autoimmune diseases, however it’s very non-specific, and is also not very sensitive for RA.    Useful for prognosis → higher levels of RF are predictive for increased disease severity.    Not useful to follow titres → once you have a positive RF, you have a positive RF; changes in it aren’t predictive of changes in your disease.  Radiographic Findings in RA  Periarticular Osteopenia → loss of bone density near the joints, seen as increased lucency on XR.  Joint Space Narrowing  Erosions → this can look as if ‘bites’ are taken out of the bones.  Mal-alignment → ulnar deviation of the PIP joints are shown to the right.  Objective      Why should suspected rheumatoid arthritis be referred early?    90% of the joints involved in RA are affected within the first year          So joint damage is actually an early feature of RA.      You have to treat RA quickly, before permanent damage occurs.        Objective      How does the philosophy of DMARD/biologic use differ from NSAID/steroid use in rheumatoid arthritis? Why is early therapy important?    See DMARDs and Biologics lecture.  In general, DMARDs are great at slowing down the progression of disease, but have side effects. However, the benefit of preventing permanent damage outweighs the cost of side effects.          Clinically, the most important side effect is infection.        Classically, we use combination therapy with 2 or 3 DMARDs; the most common combination is triple therapy with:          Methotrexate.      Sulfasalazine.      Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil).        If there’s a failure to control symptoms with this combination, we often add a 4th DMARD (leflunomide), or add Biologics.          Biologics are very effective, but very expensive.      These are generally classified into TNF antagonists and non-TNF antagonists.      Recall that TNF is a potent inflammatory cytokine, which has a number of downstream effects.      TNF is a major contributor to the inflammatory &amp; destructive changes seen with RA, which is why blocking TNF is so clinically effective.

What joints (identified on a homunculus) are affected by inflammatory conditions versus those affected by degenerative conditions?  If you think it is an inflammatory arthritis what blood work should you send and why is it useful?  Gain a basic understanding of an approach to polyarthritis.  Objective      Understand the differences between inflammatory, degenerative, and chronic pain conditions.    When a patient presents with pain and stiffness in multiple areas of the body, you can think of 3 broad categories of causes:          Inflammatory Conditions.      Degenerative Conditions.      Chronic Pain Conditions.        Inflammatory Conditions:          Caused by inflammation of the synovial membrane, due to immune attack.      Cardinal signs → rubor, tumor, calor, dolor, functio leasa. (recall ITM).      Inflammation of the synovium causes increased fluid production → swelling.        Degenerative Conditions:          Caused by the breakdown of cartilage, eg. OA.        Chronic Pain:          Diffuse soreness and stiffness in the joints and surrounding muscles      No joint swelling, redness, or warmth      Causes pain and loss of function, eg. fibromyalgia.        What gender is more predisposed to these conditions?          All 3 are more common in women.        Objective      What joints (identified on a homunculus) are affected by inflammatory conditions versus those affected by degenerative conditions?    What joints are involved?  CMC = carpometacarpal joint, MCP = metacarpophalangeal joint, PIP = proximal interphalangeal joint, DIP = distal interphalangeal joint.          Inflammatory → MCP, PIP involvement, DIP spared.                  Wrist also often very swollen.          Ankle swelling is also specific for inflammatory arthritis; very rare to get ankle swelling with OA.          Knee, hip involvement can be seen in both inflammatory and degenerative conditions.                    Degenerative → DIP, PIP involvement, MCP spared.                  1st CMC joint (for thumb) also swollen in majority of cases.          Same goes for the 1st MTP joint.                    Chronic Pain → no truly swollen joints on examination, although patients may complain of a subjective experience of swelling.        Objective      What are the historical features that discriminate inflammatory from non-inflammatory arthritis?    Age of onset:           Inflammatory → bimodal; seen in younger patients, but can also be seen in older ages.      Degenerative → seen in the elderly.      Chronic Pain → seen in younger patients (around 40).        Pattern of onset:          Inflammatory → additive (adds joints), insidious (over weeks to months). Can also sometimes be acute.      Degenerative → slow progression, (over months to years).      Chronic pain → may be triggered; insidious onset of diffuse aching pain.        Objective      Describe a prototypical patient with inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, including what type of people usually develop it, how the disease typically starts, what joints it affects, how it progresses, and what constitutional features are present?    Describe a prototypical patient with degenerative arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, including what type of people usually develop it, how the disease typically starts, what joints it affects, how it progresses, and what constitutional features are present?    Describe a prototypical patient with fibromyalgia including what type of people usually develop it, how the disease typically starts, what joints it affects, how it progresses, and what constitutional features are present?    The pertinent features are described below.  Joint involvement was described previously as well:          Inflammatory → MCPs, PIPs, spares the DIPs, often involves the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and ankles.      Degenerative → PIPs, DIPs, spares the MCPs, often involves the 1st CMC joint, acromion, and 1st MTP joint of foot.                  Both inflammatory and degenerative arthritis affect the knees and hips.                    Chronic Pain → the joints themselves do not have specific pain; rather, the pain is diffuse over the joints and muscles.      Inflammatory, Degenerative, &amp; Chronic Pain Disorders                   Inflammatory      Degenerative      Chronic Pain                  Description:      Joint inflammation due to immune attack      Degenerative breakdown of the joint cartilage      Diffuse (not joint-specific) pain              Gender most often seen in:      Women      Women      Women              Age of onset:      Bimodal, both younger and more elderly.      Elderly      Younger (~40)              Pattern of onset:      Additive, insidious (weeks-months)      Slow (months-years)      Often can be triggered, insidious              Joint pain:      YES      YES      NO              Swelling:      YES      YES      NO              Joint Redness:      YES      NO      NO              Morning Stiffness:      &gt;1 hour      15-20 minutes      &gt;1 hour              Fatigue:      New and severe      Mild      Severe              Loss of function:      Rapid      Slow      Rapid              Fever:      Possibly      Never      Never              Weight Loss:      Possibly      Unusual      Unusual        Objective      If you think it is an inflammatory arthritis what are some possible causes?    Note that we can usually narrow it down to one of (1) inflammatory, (2) degenerative, or (3) chronic pain just from history and physical exam.          This determination is a clinical diagnosis; no lab tests or imaging is needed.      If the history is suggestive of osteoarthritis (degenerative), or chronic pain, then no blood work is needed.      If the history is suggestive of inflammatory arthritis, then some lab tests can help differentiate the cause.        Most common causes of inflammatory arthritis:          Infection      Rheumatoid Arthritis.      Seronegative Arthritis.      Connective Tissue Disease.      Associated with another Systemic Disease.        Infection:          Acute inflammatory polyarthritis is usually associated with a viral infection, such as:                  Parvovirus B19, EBV, Rubella, Hep B/C, HIV.                    Note that this is different from acute inflammatory monoarthritis, which was usually bacterial (S. aureus was most common).      Typically self-limited over 2-6 weeks.        Rheumatoid Arthritis:          Chronic, destructive inflammatory arthritis.      Prominent morning stiffness + fatigue.      Rheumatoid nodules and bone erosions on XR can be seen (although these are rare early in disease).        Seronegative Arthritis → 4 types.          Psoriatic arthritis → associated with Hx (personal of FHx) or psoriasis.      Ankylosing Spondylitis → inflammatory lower back disease.      Reactive Arthritis → arthritis, conjunctivitis, urethritis reaction after a urinary or GI tract infection.                  Affects the joints of the lower extremity predominantly.                    Enteropathic Arthritis → associated with IBD (UC or Crohn’s).        Connective Tissue Disorders → inflammatory CTDs include:          Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE, lupus).      Sjogren’s Syndrome.      Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis.      Systemic Sclerosis.      Mixed Connective Tissue Disorder.        Objective      If you think it is an inflammatory arthritis what blood work should you send and why is it useful?    CBC → signs of infection (WBC ↑) or inflammation (reactive thrombocytosis, Plt ↑)  ESR, CRP → markers for inflammation.  Albumin, AST, ALT, ALP → liver function tests.          This is important because some drugs we use (eg. some DMARDs) can cause liver inflammation.        Creatinine, Urinalysis → kidney function tests.          This is important because some drugs we use (eg. some DMARDs) can cause renal damage.        Hep B&amp;C Testing → rule out viral arthritis caused by Hep B or C.  Rheumatoid Factor → will be negative in seronegative arthritis.          However, may also be negative with rheumatoid arthritis, especially early on in disease.        ANA, ENA, ds-DNA, Complement (C3/C4) → often associated with connective tissue diseases (will see more in later lectures).  IgG → polyclonal increase is suggestive of acute inflammation.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/02/18/acute-polyarthritis.html"},

	{"title": "Chronic Monoarthritis", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Osteoarthritis          What is the most common type of chronic monoarthritis?      What is the difference between primary and secondary osteoarthritis.      What is the prototypical presentation for primary osteoarthritis including the common age of affected individuals, typical joints affected (identify on a homunculus), modifiable risk factors, diurnal variation and effects of activity, and natural progression of the disease?      What are the five classic radiographic findings of osteoarthritis?      What laboratory abnormalities are seen in osteoarthritis?      What common non-pharmacologic strategies are utilized for the management of osteoarthritis?      What are the common pharmacologic modalities used for the management of osteoarthritis?      When should a patient with osteoarthritis be referred to a surgeon?      Osteoarthritis  Objective      What is the most common type of chronic monoarthritis?    Osteoarthritis.          Also known as degenerative joint disease; results in the wearing down of the cartilage and surrounding bone of the joint.      Extremely common; currently affects 1 in every 10 Canadians.        Objective      What is the difference between primary and secondary osteoarthritis.    Primary Osteoarthritis → degeneration of the joints due to ‘wear and tear’; no obvious cartilage injury.  Secondary Osteoarthritis → the degeneration is secondary to something, ie. an injury to the cartilage.          Eg. athletes who overuse certain joints throughout their career.        Objective      What is the prototypical presentation for primary osteoarthritis including the common age of affected individuals, typical joints affected (identify on a homunculus), modifiable risk factors, diurnal variation and effects of activity, and    Onset of Osteoarthritis          Seen in the elderly, with women &gt; men.      Often exacerbated by higher BMIs (increases load on joints).      Progression is insidious, over the span of months to years.        Symptoms of Osteoarthritis          Pain that worsens with weight bearing and activity, and improves with rest.      Worse in the morning; often presents with morning stiffness (15-30 min).      The involved joint(s) will often be stiff after periods of inactivity.      Tenderness on palpation, bony enlargement, crepitus on motion, limitation of joint motion.        Sparing of the MCP Joints.                  This is an important differentiator from rheumatoid arthritis, which does affect the MCP joints.          Rheumatoid arthritis → MCP + PIP, spares the DIPs.          Osteoarthritis → DIPs and PIPs, spares the MCPs.                      Finger Joint Involvement with Arthritis        Rheumatoid arthritis:              Affects the MCPs and PIPs.        Spares the DIPs (farthest).        Also affects the wrist.              Osteoarthritis:              Affects the PIPs and DIPs.        Spares the MCPs (closest).              What other joints are affected with osteoarthritis?          In addition to the DIP and PIP joints, osteoarthritis commonly affects other joints in the body.      Hands → DIP, PIP, 1st CMC joint.      Hip      Knee      Feet → first MTP.      Spine → cervical, lumbar.        Objective      What are the five classic radiographic findings of osteoarthritis?    Non-uniform Joint Space Narrowing → typically the side that bears more weight will be narrower.  Subchondral Sclerosis:          This is increased density of the bone right underneath the cartilage (hence sub-chondral).      Seen on XR as opacification of the bone at the joint.        Osteophytes → small bone projections form, particularly at the margins.  Subchondral Cysts → sometimes fluid will be pushed underneath the cartilage, forming cysts in the bone.  Malalignment.  Objective      What laboratory abnormalities are seen in osteoarthritis?    All laboratory investigations should be normal in OA          Recall that OA is a ‘non-inflammatory’ arthritis, so we wouldn’t expect to see anything like an elevated CRP or ESR, etc.        Objective      What common strategies are utilized for the management of osteoarthritis?    NON-PHARMACOLOGIC:          Exercise &amp; weight loss → very effective for reducing joint burden.      Strength training → strengthen the surrounding muscles.      Proper footwear.      Assistive devices.      Education.        PHARMACOLOGIC:          Topical Medications                  Capsaicin creams → hot pepper creams.                          Depletes nerve endings of chemicals needed for pain transmission.              Results in ‘analgesia’; touch and temp sensation are not affected.              Somewhat annoying to use; DON’T TOUCH YOUR EYE after applying it!                                Topical NSAIDs                          Little systemic absorption, so less risk of side effects like PUD.              But only has shown small effects in clinical trials, and is messy.                                          Intra-articular Medications                  Corticosteroids                          Cheap, relatively safe.              Has a short term, 4-8 week benefit, but no evidence for benefit at 12 and 24 weeks.              Predictors of response are unclear (it’s not obvious who will feel better and who won’t).                                Viscosupplementation → synthetic/biologically derived Hyaluronic acid.                          Supplementation of the synovial fluid of the joint with hyaluronic acid (a normal component of the fluid).              Only approved for OA of the knee (no other joints).              Variable effect; some people have a great response, others have no response at all.              Very expensive; $300 per course.                                          Systemic Medications                  Simple Analgesics → Acetaminophen.          NSAIDs → or COXIBs.                            NSAIDs (eg. Ibuprofen) block the actions of both COX-1 and COX-2.              COXIBs (eg. Celebrex) only block the actions of COX-2.              Both perform better than Acetaminophen, but carry additional risks (GI, renal, cardiovascular).                                  Recall the role that prostaglandins play on the afferent arterioles of the kidney.                  Recall that NSAIDs can cause PUD, particular gastric ulcers.                  Also now thought that all NSAIDs may increase the risk of MIs, particularly the COXIBs (recall the Vioxx recall).                                                              Narcotics (Opioids)                          Exceedingly rare for patients with OA to show addictive behaviour.              Most patients will voluntarily stop their opioids after joint replacement.              The primary worry with OA is actually with the side effects: sedation, confusion, constipation.              Sedation and confusion in particular can increase the risk for falls, especially in the typical demographic for OA (old).                                            Objective      When should a patient with osteoarthritis be referred to a surgeon?    Most people with arthritis, including older individuals, should be referred for surgical treatment when other treatment is ineffective and function is impaired.          Surgery should not be used as a last resort; don’t wait until there is significant deformity, muscle weakness, or loss of function. If you do, the replacement will do little to help.      There is no “magic age” for surgery.        The decision for whether to undergo surgery depends both on patient factors (their function, their goals), and physician factors (XR changes, medical risk factors).", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/02/17/chronic-monoarthritis.html"},

What is the difference between chondrocalcinosis and pseudogout?      What is the management strategy for acute pseudogout including both non- pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy?      Introduction to Arthritis  Arthritis can be divided into 2 broad categories:          Non-inflammatory Arthritis      Inflammatory Arthritis        Non-inflammatory arthritis is essentially only osteoarthritis.  Inflammatory arthritis can be further divided into:          Infectious arthritis → bacterial, viral, parasitic, etc.      Non-infectious arthritis → rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative arthropathies, crystal induced arthritis.        See the below chart (IMPORTANT).          Today we’ll be dealing with a subset of these conditions which can result in an acute arthritis in a single joint.        Arthritis can also be described by the number of joints involved:          Monoarthritis → 1 involved joint.      Oligoarthritis → 2-4 involved joints.      Polyarthritis → &gt;4 involved joints.      Introduction to Acute Monoarthritis  Acute → &lt; 6 weeks.  Mono → 1.  Arthritis → inflamed joint.  Acute Monoarthritis → a single inflamed joint for less than 6 weeks.  Objective      What are the common causes of non-traumatic intense acute mono-arthritis (warm, hot, red, and swollen joint)?    Causes of an acute, hot, red, monoarthritis include:          INFECTION!      Gout.      Pseudogout.        Objective      What important diagnosis should be ruled out in ALL cases of non-traumatic intense acute mono-arthritis (warm, hot, red, and swollen joint)?    Whenever you see an acute monoarthritis, suspect infection.          Septic arthritis is what’s dangerous, so it’s what you HAVE to rule out.      Gout and pseudogout can mimic infection, but are less serious.      Septic Arthritis  Septic Arthritis → infection of a joint leading to arthritis.  Why is it so important to treat septic arthritis so quickly?          Acute Bacterial Arthritis is a medical emergency.      If it’s not treated quickly, it can lead to permanent, irreversible joint damage.        Risk Factors for Septic Arthritis:          Immunosuppressed individuals.      The very old, or the very young (extremes of age).      IVDU, alcohol.      Recent infection.      Prior joint operations (prosthetic joint, recent surgery).      Underlying joint abnormality → eg. arthritis.      Direct penetrating trauma.      Skin infection.        How does an infection get to the joint?          Most commonly this is via hematogenous spread from a remote site.      Less common are direct inoculation (eg. trauma/surgery), or from spread from a contiguous site (eg. from adjacent osteomyelitis).        Objective      Describe the initial management &amp; investigative strategy for suspected septic arthritis.    If you see an acute, hot, red joint, you always aspirate the joint.          IF THE JOINT IS RED, THE TUBES GET FED.        What do you send the joint aspirate for?          The 3 C’s                  Cell count → takes a few hours.          Cuture &amp; Sensitivity → takes 1-2 days.          Crystals → takes a few hours.                    You should also do a gram stain.        Initial Management          Urgent I&amp;D (Incision &amp; Drainage).      Antibiotics.      Analgesia.      Rest.        Continued management          Repead I&amp;D until the surgeon is confident the joint is clean.      IV antibiotics for 4-6 weeks.        Objective      Suggest an initial empiric antibiotic regimen for septic arthritis and explain your rationale based on the common organisms along with your suggested duration of treatment?    Most common organisms with septic arthritis:          Gram positive cocci (80%)                  Staphylococcus (60%) → most commonly S. aureus.          Streptococcus (20%).                    Gram negative (15%).                  Seen in the immunocompromised, elderly, neodates, and IVDUs.                    Anaerobic organisms.        Depending on the gram stain results, some empiric Abx choices are as follows:          Gram positive → 1st generation Cephalosporin, or Vancomycin if you’re worried about MRSA.      Gram negative → 3rd generation Cephalosporin (Ceftriaxone, Cefotaxime, Ceftazidime).        Objective      Describe why you would consult orthopedic surgery in a case of septic arthritis?    Because the infection is localized to the joint, systemic antibiotics are unlikely to clear it unless the joint has been drained and cleaned.          Surgical drainage is necessary.      Gout  Gout → Acute inflammatory arthritis caued by uric acid crystal deposition in the joint.          Often referred to as “The Disease of Kings”, for reasons that will be discussed shortly.        Pathophysiology of gout:          Normally, the body’s production of uric acid is matched by its excretion, leaving the body in a steady state.      With underexcretion, uric acid can accumulate in the body, leading to hyperuricemia.      With excessive hyperuricemia, the uric acid may oversaturate the blood, resulting in crystal deposition.        Objective      What is the description of a classic attack of acute gout including the types of people it affects and the characteristics of the attack including the onset, progression, pain intensity, joints affected and duration?    Who gets gout?          The age of onset of gout differs between men and women.      In men, the first attack is between the ages of 35 and 50.      In women, the first attack is often after menopause, as estrogen has a protective effect on uric acid secretion.        Clinical Features of the attack:          Starts very quickly and very intensely – progressing over a few hours.                  Untreated attacks will typically take about 7-10 days to resolve.                    Very painful (can’t stand having the bed sheets touch it).      Swollen, warm, and red.      May feel unwell and have an associated fever.      In other words, this is very similar to an infected joint.                  Hence, you always have to rule out a septic arthritis, even if he has no risk factors for infection, and a history more suggestive for gout.                      What joints does it affect?          Usually a single joint in the lower extremity.      Most commonly (50% of cases), it’s the First Metatarsophalyngeal (MTP) joint; ie. the MTP of the big toe.      Other common joints include the ankle and knee.        What characteristics do people with gout typically have?:          Obesity.      Hypertension.      Diabetes.      Hyperlipidemia.        These are pretty similar to the vascular risk factors (minus smoking).          This is also why it’s called ‘a disease of plenty’, or ‘The disease of Kings’; historically it was seen in fat, coddled royalty.        Objective      What are the common risk factors for the development of hyperuricemia and acute gout?    Common risk factors:          Impaired renal function.                  Impaired renal function results in impaired uric acid excretion.                    Diuretics → Lasix, hydrochlorothiazide.                  These not only affect uric acid excretion, but also result in uric acid concentration due to the peeing out lots of water.                    Excessive alcohol intake.      Family history.      Male sex.        Objective      What are the common precipitating factors for the development of acute gout?    Patients will be predisposed to having gout by having a high uric acid concentration in their blood (either due to fluid loss or impaired uric acid secretion).          However, this does not necessarily result in gout itself; usually, a trigger is required.        What ‘triggers’ an attack of gout?          Remember this with the SMARTS acronym:                  S → Surgery.          M → Mechanical Injury.          A → Alcohol.          R → Recent Illness.          T → Travel/Dehydration.          S → Start/stop Allopurinol.                      Triggers for Gout      Remember this with the SMARTS acronym:              S → Surgery.        M → Mechanical Injury.        A → Alcohol.        R → Recent Illness.        T → Travel/Dehydration.        S → Start/stop Allopurinol.              Notes on Triggers:          It’s often thought that the big toe is so commonly involved because microtrauma to the toe occurs when you walk.      Travel/dehydration can trigger an attack of gout by increasing the concentration of blood uric acid.      Although allopurinol is a treatment for hyperuricemia, it can actually exacerbate an acute episode of gout.        Objective      What investigations should be ordered in a patient presenting with suspected gout?    The only way to confirm a diagnosis of gout is to aspirate the joint.            This is something you should be doing ANYWAY in order to rule out septic arthritis.                  As before, IF THE JOINT IS RED, THE TUBES GET FED.                    In the case of gout however, the key diagnostic feature is the presence of a specific type of crystal:                  Needle shaped urate crystals, which are negatively birefringent under polarized light.                      Diagnosis of Gout      Needle shaped crystals that are negatively birefringent under polarized light are pathognomonic for gout.    What other blood tests should be ordered?          CBC-D.      Creatinine → assess kidney function (uric acid excretion).      Uric acid → you’d think this would always be high, but it may actually be normal during an acute attack.                  So during an acute attack of gout, uric acid is unreliable; this should be taken once the attack subsides.                    Fasting glucose → diabetes is a risk factor.      Fasting lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol) → obesity and hyperlipidemia are risk factors.        Objective      What is the utility of uric acid levels in the diagnosis and management of gout?    As mentioned above, the uric acid levels may actually be normal when measured during an acute attack of gout.          Uric acid should hence be measured after an acute attack has subsided.        What should be done if a patient has hyperuricemia?          Many people have hyperuricemia and are completely asymptomatic.      Most of these patients will never get gout.      Hence, hyperuricemia CANNOT be used to make a diagnosis of gout on its own.      Do NOT treat isolated hyperuricemia.        Objective      What is the only true way to confirm a diagnosis of gout?    Urate crystals on joint aspirate.          As mentioned before, this is the only way to confirm the diagnosis.      These crystals should be negatively birefringent under polarized light.        Objective      What is the management strategy for acute gout including both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy?    Non-pharmacologic (fairly obvious, given risk factors):          Rest, ice, elevation.      Dietary modification:                  Red meat and seafood are bad.          Vegetables and low fat dairy are good.                    Reduce alcohol intake.      Good hydration.        Pharmacologic (excluding urate lowering therapy):          Intra-articular corticosteroids → inject the affected joint.      Oral NSAIDs or COXIBs.      Oral Colchicine.      Oral Prednisone → if the joint is hard to inject (eg. the big toe).        Recurrence Rates          1 year → 60%.      2 years → 80%.      5 years → 90%.      In other words, if you have 1 attack, you’re very likely to get another one!        Objective      List the indications for allopurinol in patients with gout and discuss risks and benefits of this medication?    Allopurinol → urate lowering medication, that reduces hyperuricemia.          Usually only used in more extreme cases, because once you’re on a urate lowering therapy, you have to stay on it for life.      Another medication that can be used is Febuxostat.      Both of these inhibit xanthine oxidase, which converts xanthine to uric acid.        When should urate lowering therapy be considered?            Recurrent acute episodes of gout that are affecting lifestyle.      Patient at risk from complications of treatments required for acute attacks.      Patient accepts the need to stay on these medications for life.      Uric acid tophaceous deposits → nodular, often deforming masses of uric acid that deposit in soft tissue (skin, internal organs)                  An example is shown to the right.          This is considered an absolute indication for uric acid lowering treatment, even if they’re not having many acute attacks.                      What are the risks associated with urate lowering medications?          Whenever you start or stop one of these medications (allopurinol, febuxostat), it can actually precipitate an attack of gout (the last S in SMARTS was ‘start/stop allopurinol’).      So if you have a non-compliant patient that only remembers to take it a few days, this can actually increase the number of flares a patient will experience!      When you start a patient on this medication, you have to warn them of the risk of an immediate flare!                  Oftentimes, prophylaxis with an NSAID/Colchicine/Prednisone is given early on, in order to reduce the risk of this occurring.                      What are the benefits of urate lowering medications?          Will help to reduce uric acid to the lower limit of laboratory reference range.      Will prevent tophi from forming.      Will reduce flares long-term if taken continuously.      Pseudogout  Acute Pseudogout → acute inflammatory arthritis caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals.          Here, the pathognomonic finding will be rhomboid shaped, intracellular positively bi-refringent crystals.      Pseudogout is also generally less painful than gout.        Gout vs Pseudogout                             Gout        Pseudogout                            Crystal composition:        Uric acid crystals        Calcium pyrophosphate crystals                    Crystal shape:        Needle shaped        Rhomboid shaped                    Under Polarized Light:        Negatively bi-refringent        Positively bi-refringent                    Crystal appearance:                              Useful mnemonics for comparing gout to pseudogout:          Pseudogout is Positively birefringent.      Gout has needle shaped crystals, and is hence more painful.        Objective      What is the description of a classic attack of pseudogout including the types of people it affects and the characteristics of the attack including onset, progression, pain intensity, joints affected, and duration?    Who gets pseudogout?          Typically older individuals.      Most will have a concomitant osteoarthritis.        Clinical features of the attack          These are similar to with gout or an infected joint.      Starts quickly and very intensely, but tends to be less intense than gout, and also has a less rapid onset.                  Untreated attacks can last several days to a few weeks.                    Very painful, swollen, red, warm joint.      May feel unwell and have an associated fever.        What joints does it affect?          Usually a single joint in the lower extremity.      Knee is the most common.        Objective      What is the difference between chondrocalcinosis and pseudogout?    Pseudogout → an acute inflammatory arthritis caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition in the joint  Chondrocalcinosis → a radiographic finding of calcium pyrophosphate deposition in the cartilage.          In other words, chondrocalcinosis is a sign that calcium pyrophosphate had been deposited into the joint at some point in the past.      It is not indicative of a current episode of pseudogout; it just suggests that there has been past deposition.        Objective      What is the management strategy for acute pseudogout including both non- pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy?    Non-pharmacologic:          Rest, Ice, and Elevate the Joint.      Good Hydration.        Pharmacologic → fairly similar to with gout, except without colchicine.          Intra-articular corticosteroids → inject the affected joint.      Oral NSAIDs or COXIBs.      Oral Prednisone → if the joint is hard to inject (eg. the big toe).        There’s no equivalent to allopurinol or febuxostat in pseudogout          In other words, there’s no preventative treatment we can give that will lower calcium pyrophosphate levels.

	{"title": "Soft Tissue Injuries Small Group", "text": "  Soft Tissue Injuries Answers      See Soft Tissue Injuries Answers.  Case #1  Neck Pain Case  A 43 year-old painter comes to see you about her severe neck pain. She tells you that her symptoms started about four weeks ago when she began working for a new client and had to assemble scaffolding on the first day. When she woke the next morning, she had pain in the lower neck on the right side rated 9 of 10. Since the onset of the pain, she has been unable to fully extend her neck. She tells you that occasionally the pain radiates across the shoulder or into her midback. She also tells you that she experiences headaches related to the neck pain. Her review of systems and past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.  List your top 5 differential diagnoses for this patient’s presentation.          Cervical radiculopathy.      Myofascial pain.      Disc pain.      Facet joint pain.      Osteoarthritis.        Physical Exam Findings  On physical exam, there are no fasciculations or atrophy. Her reflexes are 2+ on the left and on the right. Strength testing is equal bilaterally. Range of motion of the neck is limited by pain, especially in extension and rotation. Spurling’s maneuver is negative. The patient has tenderness to palpation over the paraspinal muscles and over the facet joints.   What is the most likely diagnosis given this patient’s presentation?          Facet joint pain → since there’s tenderness over the facet joints.      Normal reflexes and strength suggest that it’s not a neuronal problem (upper motor neuron will cause hyperreflexia, lower motor neuron will cause delayed reflexes).      Spurling’s maneuver → laterally rotate and flex the patient’s head, and press down on the top of their head to impinge the nerve.                  If there’s pre-existing nerve root compression, this will result in pain.                      If this patient’s findings had included ataxia, pain radiating into her legs, tingling or pins-and-needles sensation in the legs, and new onset urinary incontinence, what would the most likely diagnosis be?          Spinal root compression, eg. due to a disc herniation.        What tests may be helpful in arriving at a definitive diagnosis?          Primarily by Hx and P/E, especially if there are no neurologic deficits.      Plain films (XRs) and obliques (showing the ‘Scottie Dog’) may help localize the issue to the facet joints.      MRI is the best (but most expensive and difficult to get) test with spinal issues.        What management would you recommend for this patient?          Conservative management; ice, rest, NSAIDs.      Short term neck support (long-term neck support may weaken the surrounding muscles).      If there’s no response to conservative therapy, other interventions like intra-articular injections or medial branch rhizotomies can be considered.      Case #2  Back Pain Case  A 28-year-old male construction worker injured his back while moving a piece of heavy machinery. He was flexed and rotated at the time of the injury. The doctor in the walk-in clinic put him on one week of bed rest but even after that, pain in the low back region has been unremitting. Numerous radiological investigations are all negative. The pain is localized to the low back with mild radiation to the buttocks. Tenderness is present quite diffusely over the low back. Pain is worse on lumbar extension. Neurological examination is normal.  You, a physiatrist with many years of experience, are now seeing him 12 weeks post-injury. He has been unable to return to work. He has gained 10 pounds. He takes 12 Tylenol #3s per day. He has difficulty sleeping because of the pain and lately because of financial worries. He spends most of his time watching TV. He smokes a pack per day, and drinks 3-4 alcoholic beverages and 5 cups of coffee per day.  What are the most probable diagnoses of his back pain? (think anatomically)          Facet joint pain.      Disc herniation.      Spinal stenosis.      Myofascial pain.        What is the significance of back pain that is worse with extension?          Pattern 1B or 2 back pain.      Increases likelihood that this is related to the spine (ie. facet joint pain, spondylolisthesis, disk herniation, etc).        What are risk factors for chronic low back pain? What features in this patient’s history predisposed him to chronic pain?          Psychosocial factors.      Inability to return to work.      Sedentary lifestyle.      Smoking/alcohol use.        From a medical point of view, what is the impact of this injury on the patient? What is the psychological impact?          Medical impact → drug dependence, impaired IADLs, impact on QALYs.      Psychological impact → affects mood, self-esteem, financial security, sense of purpose, and sleep.        What medications or modalities may be beneficial here? What other allied health professionals may be helpful in managing this patient?          Stretches, core conditioning, and PT.      Injection therapy.      Social work, PT, OT.        He wants to see a chiropractor and asks your opinion. Discuss.          Chiropractic care can help; they can often counsel patients about exercise as well.      Case #3  Shoulder Pain Case  A 43-year-old right-handed painter comes to see you complaining of gradual left shoulder pain, which began about two months ago. Lately she has had difficulty in reaching for the doorknob and lifting objects. The pain awakens her at night. The pain was preceded by an unusually heavy workload, but she did not want to turn down the jobs and feels she may have overworked herself. At the present time she is between painting jobs and is taking coated ASA on an as-necessary basis. She is on no other medication and does not have a previous history of shoulder injury.   Based on this patient’s history, what is your top 3 differential diagnosis for her shoulder pain?          Rotator Cuff Disease.      Arthritis.      Shoulder instability.        Physical Exam Findings  On examination of the left shoulder, there is normal bulk, tone, and strength present distally in the arm and sensation is intact. Pain is increased by resisted external rotation and abduction of the left shoulder. There are tender points just anterior and distal to the tip of the acromion of left shoulder. The left trapezius is also tender compared to the right. There is restricted active range of movement with internal rotation limited to 45° and abduction limited in active range to 90° with a painful arc present. Passive ROM is reasonably full with slight limitation related to pain.  Based on the physical exam findings, what is the most likely diagnosis? What is the significance of the restricted range of motion?          Rotator Cuff Disease.      The restricted active RoM and the normal passive RoM suggest that there’s no joint issue, but there is a soft tissue problem.      Pain with abduction (supraspinatus) and external rotation (infraspinatus) further suggests a rotator cuff issue. Same with the positive painful arc sign.        Design a practical treatment approach for this patient.          Physiotherapy → strengthening the shoulder joint.      Activity modification → don’t do things that make the shoulder hurt.      Pain management → NSAIDs.      If 12 weeks of conservative Tx fails, injections and surgery can be considered.                  Surgical modalities include subacromial decompression, or RC repair if there’s any cuff tearing.                      If her findings had been the same except for diffuse active andpassive ROM restriction, most notably on external rotation, whatwould be the most likely diagnosis?          Arthritis, since both the passive RoM and active RoM are affected, suggesting a joint issue.      Case #4  Thigh Pain Case  A 57-year-old woman presents with pain in the left thigh area. The pain has been coming on gradually and although she had a fall two years earlier, she did not notice this pain until six months ago. The pain is made worse by walking and by climbing stairs. When arising from a period of resting, the pain and stiffness is initially worse. The pain is relieved initially by walking several steps but the pain returns after the patient has been walking for greater than five minutes. She is unable to sleep on her left side and frequently awakens with this pain. On examination, this is a healthy-appearing 57-year-old woman. The pain is reproduced by resisted abduction. Local tenderness is present over the greater trochanter of the left hip. There is decreased hip internal rotation on the left. There is a slightly antalgic gait, and a slight Trendelenberg gait. The lumbar spine is slightly restricted and painful especially with extension. There is no other wasting or weakness. Neurological exam is normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? List 3 other diagnoses you should consider.          Hip Adductor Tendonitis.      Arthritis.      Bursitis.      Referred pain from the joint above (spine) or below (knee).        What is the cause of her presentation?          Her previous fall caused her to use one side of her body more, resulting in the hip adductor tendonitis (gluteus medius, gluteus minimus).        What investigations are appropriate?          Rule out red flags → weight loss, systemic symptoms, saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder problems, etc etc.        Design a practical treatment approach.          Similar to before; PT, activity modification, ice, NSAIDs, etc.      If you suggest a cane, tell them to use it on the opposite site of the injured hip (it gives you another fulcrum on which you can put your weight).      Case #5  Knee Pain Case  A 16-year-old female presents with gradual onset (over a three-month period) of pain in the right knee, which is increased by activity, particularly by climbing stairs. She gives no history of the knee locking and has not injured it in any known way. She notes that when she is doing physical activities, such as playing volleyball, she gets pain and “cracking” when she squats. When she sits for a while and then stands, it often causes pain. On examination, this is a healthy appearing person but there is local tenderness along the medial and lateral borders of the patella. Patella grinding is present (positive patella grind test) when the patella is pressed against the femur and pain is elicited by resisted leg extension from a fully flexed position. The Q angle measures 15E bilaterally. Other aspects of examination of the knee are normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis?          Patellofemoral pain syndrome, especially considering her age.      Gradual onset, affected by activity, and there’s a positive patella grind test.        Why does the pain come on with exercise or after sitting?          During exercise, there’s knee extensor load, which exacerbates pressure in the patellofemoral joint.      After sitting, the force needed to get up and extend the knee does the same thing.        Outline the principles of management.          Conservative Tx, just like before.      Little supporting evidence for other treatment modalities.      Case #6  Knee Injury Case  A 20 year-old wide receiver comes to see you after injuring his left knee in practice about an hour ago. He tells you that during practice, he was running route drills, practicing his cuts, when he changed direction, pivoted and heard a “pop” before he suddenly collapsed on the field in pain. His teammates also said they heard a pop and helped him into your office. He does not have a history of knee injuries or instability, and is otherwise healthy and in excellent physical shape. While in the waiting room, he took 2 Advil, but is otherwise on no medications and has no known medical conditions.  Based on the history, what are your top 5 differential diagnoses for this patient?          ACL tear.      PCL tear.      MCL tear.      LCL tear.      Meniscus tear.        How can you differentiate between these diagnoses during your physical exam? What tests will be useful? Will you be able to perform them?          ACL tear → anterior drawer test, Lachman maneuver.      PCL tear → posterior drawer test, sag sign.      Lateral/Medial tear → varus/valgus stress test.      Meniscus tear → McMurray test.        Physical Exam Findings  On physical exam, the patient’s left knee is slightly swollen compared to the right. He is in significant pain, but allows you to perform several tests. Notably, there is significant anterior laxity on both the Lachman and anterior drawer. When palpating his joint line, he tells you that it is not more tender than the rest of his knee. Varus and valgus stress tests are painful but not lax. There is no sag sign and the posterior drawer is negative.  What investigations will you perform?          XR → check to see that there’s no avulsion fracture.      MRI → for ligament/cartilage damage.      CT → if MRI is not available.        Outline an acute management strategy for this patient.          P/E is suggestive of an ACL Tear.      Short term, you try to maintain the strength of the knee and prevent contractures while swelling goes down.      NSAIDs and braces can be used as well.      Surgical repair is undergone when swelling and inflammation has gone down, particular since this patient is an athlete.        *Outline a long-term management strategy for this patient. *          Post-operatively, PT is needed to strengthen the surrounding muscles, and to prevent compensatory overuse of the contralateral knee.      Case #7  Flexion Contracture Case  A 44 year-old businessman undergoes a laprascopic cholecystectomy; unfortunately, he experiences a number of complications during and after the surgery and must be admitted to the ICU. One month after his ICU admission, he has plantarflexion contractures and heel ulcers.  What are flexion contractures?          Shortening of the connective tissue of a muscle, resulting in a reduced RoM.        What are 5 risk factors for flexion contractures?          Immobility.      Injury.        What are the 3 most common flexion contractures?          The 3 most common flexion contractures are the ankle, knee, and elbow.      It’s thought that this is because the corresponding muscles cross 2 joints:                  Knee → hamstrings (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps femoris).          Ankle →          Elbow → biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis.                      What impact do flexion contractures have on patients’ functional status and return to ambulation? Provide examples for different joints.          These are common sense.        What is your management strategy for this patient?          Stretching, work on passive RoM.        How can flexion contractures be prevented in patients with known risk factors such as lengthy anticipated ICU stays?          Motility; avoid the preventable risk factors.

	{"title": "Child Health Small Groups &ndash; Limp", "text": "Lecture Objectives  By the end of the session students should be able to:          Develop a systematic method to approaching acute limb pain.      List at least 4 important factors for the diagnosis of acute limb pain.      Define Septic Arthritis and Transient Synovitis.      Define Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE).      List at least 3 common clinical manifestations of SCFE.      Describe characteristics of limb pain which would suggest child abuse.       Case #1  Case Summary  John, a 13-year-old boy, presents with a 6 day history of right sided limp. He complains of pain involving the right thigh and knee. He denies fever, a preceding illness or trauma and is otherwise in good health.   John presents with the clinical problem of new onset change in gait and pain. When taking the history from John, what additional information would be helpful in determining the cause of his limp?          OPQRST.      Associated symptoms (rashes, fever, weight loss, recent growth).      History of trauma.      Past medical history.      Family history.      Travel history.        What factors would be important in the physical examination?          Look, feel, move, special tests, neuromuscular exam, including the joint above and below.      Height and weight.      Gait assessment.      Hepatosplenomegaly.      Height, weight.        Additional Information  On examination, John looks well. Height is 158 cm and weight is 80 kg. Movement of the right hip in flexion, extension, and rotation is painful. There is no swelling or warmth. The rest of the general physical examination is normal. There is no rash or organomegaly.   Examine John’s growth chart. What do you conclude?          Height is normal (near the 50th %’ile), but his weight is significantly elevated (around the 99.9th %’ile).      In other words, he has a higher weight than expected given his height.        Body mass index (BMI) is calculated as kg/meter squared. What is John’s BMI? What do you conclude?          .      Hence, he’s obese (BMI greater than 95th %’ile)        John complains of thigh and knee pain, but the physical findings point to the right hip as the painful joint. How can you explain this?          Impingement of the obturator nerve can result in radiation to the thigh and knee.        Review the table on the next two pages. When assessing a child with a limp, what do you think would be the most important factors from the history and physical examination, to help in determining a differential diagnosis?          Acute vs. chronic.      Age of patient.      Systemic symptoms.      Painful vs. non-painful limp.        Which diagnoses do you think are likely possibilities for John? (List at least 4).Why? Which is MOST likely?          Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE).      Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.      Trauma.      Rheumatologic disorder.        What is the most common cause of hip pain in this age group? Do you think that is the case here? Why/why not?          Trauma, but this unlikely because there’s no history of trauma.      The next most common cause is SCFE.        Why might trauma still be in the differential diagnosis even if there is no history of injury?          The kid might be lying about his history.      There might also be the risk of non-accidental injury (child abuse).        What would you do next? How can the diagnosis be confirmed?          For SCFE, diagnosis is confirmed by bilateral hip radiography, which needs to include anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral views in patients with stable slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and anteroposterior and cross-table lateral views in patients with the unstable form.       On this anteroposterior pelvic view, note the increased opacity of his left metaphysis andthe subtle widening of the physis. Also note the malalignment of the proximal femur, i.e. the change in position between the femoral head and neck.  Define Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis          Fracture of the growth plate due to slippage of the epiphysis.      Non-inflammatory, results is displacement of the femoral head relative to the neck.      Occurs in the growth plate during periods of rapid growth in adolescents (age 10-14).      Risk factors include:                  Obesity.          Male gender.          Hypothyroidism.          GH deficiency.                    SCFE is classified as follows:                  Acute = &lt; 3 weeks.          Chronic = &gt; 3 weeks.          Acute/unstable = non-weight bearing.           Chronic/stable = Antalgic gait only.                      What is the etiology of this disorder?          Etiology is thought to be multifactorial; it’s more commonly seen in the obese with delayed skeletal maturation, or taller patients who recently underwent a rapid growth spurt.        Why is an x-ray taken of both hips when only one is symptomatic?          Some may have bilateral involvement already; others may soon progress to bilateral involvement.      Even if the other hip is normal, it’s useful to have a normal reference.        What are the treatment options for SCFE?          Stop weight-bearing in the interim.      Surgical fixation.      Possible need for late osteotomies.        What is the long-term prognosis?          Generally speaking, the prognosis is good.      However, there’s a risk of subsequent avascular necrosis and/or DJD.        If a similar history were obtained regarding a 6 year old boy (James) would another diagnosis be more likely?          Yes; it would more likely be Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease.      This is where there’s interruption of the blood supply to the femoral head, leading to AVN.      More common in boys between the ages of 3-10.      Case #2  Case Summary  Mai, a 3 year old girl, presents to the emergency department with acute onset limp and refusal to walk. Mai was well until 8 days ago when she had an upper respiratory tract infection. She had a clear nasal discharge, low-grade fever and decreased appetite for two days. Three days ago she seemed well and back to her usual self. On the day prior to this visit she awoke after her afternoon nap and refused to walk. Today she will walk if encouraged but limps and complains that it hurts.  What other information would be helpful?          OPQRST.      Associated symptoms (rashes, fever, weight loss, recent growth).      History of trauma.      Past medical history.      Family history.      Travel history.        Additional Information  Mai has previously been well. Her parents are South Korean. Mai was born in Canada. Mai’s maternal grandmother has osteoarthritis. Mai is the only child born to her parents. There is no history of trauma. She currently has no rash, has a good appetite and feels well.   What would you be looking for on physical examination?          Look, feel, move, special tests, neuromuscular exam, including the joint above and below.      Height and weight.      Gait assessment.      Hepatosplenomegaly.      Height, weight.        Additional Information  Mai is playing with her doll on the examining bed when you come to see her. She looks well and is chatty and friendly. She is sitting with her left leg flexed and externally rotated. She cooperates until you try to examine her legs at which point she cries. You examine her in her mother’s lap and determine that there is no tenderness in the ankle and knee but there is decreased range of motion in the left hip and pain with internal rotation. There is no joint swelling or redness. Mai walks a couple of steps with encouragement from her mother. Temperature is 37.4 C.   What are the most important (discriminating) features of this history and physical?          Patient age.	      Patient looks well.      Patient is improving.      Previous URTI.        What diagnoses would you consider? Are they likely? Why and/or why not? What is the most likely diagnosis          Transient monarticular synovitis/tenosynovitis.      Occult trauma.      Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis → unlikely w/o constitutional symptoms.      Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis → unlikely w/o redness or swelling.      Malignancy.      SCFE isn’t on the DDx; she’s too young.        What diagnoses would it be important to rule out?          Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.      Malignancy.      Child abuse.        What tests would help you out?          CBC-D (and white count), ESR, CRP for inflammatory/infectious causes.      X-rays.        Tests are all normal (leukocytes and ESR are only mildly elevated), X-ray is normal. What do you conclude?          Transient synovitis.        What is transient synovitis?          Self-resolving joint inflammation, with an unknown etiology.      Often preceded by a viral infection.      Common; accounts for 30% of non-traumatic limps in children.        What is the natural history of this disorder?          Resolves in 1-2 weeks with no long-term complications.        What will be the treatment plan for this girl?          Conservative treatment.      The patient should return if there are:                  Persistent symptoms past 10 days.          Worsening symptoms or systemic symptoms.                      Why must septic arthritis and osteomyelitis be considered? What factors in the history and physical would make these diagnoses more likely?          They must be considered because they’re serious, can result in long-term complications, and can spread.                  Septic arthritis → infection of the joint.          Osteomyelitis → infection of the bone.                    Factors that make these more likely include:                  High fever, markedly elevated WBC or ESR.          Severe pain and tenderness.                      Would your approach and differential diagnosis be different if Mai was 6 months old?          Transient synovitis is less likely in younger iBnfants.      Infection/trauma are more likely.        Why does trauma need to be considered? What factors in the history and physical would make this diagnosis more likely?          Risk of child abuse (NAI, non-accidental injury).      Factors that make this more likely include:                  History of trauma or atypical trauma.          Bruises of different ages.          Social/financial stressors.                    Case #3  Case Summary  Tom is a 10-month-old male infant is brought to the emergency department (ED) following a fall which occurred yesterday morning. He will no longer stand up. The parents explain that Tom was trying to run away during a game and fell down. The infant seems in obvious discomfort and is crying.   What seems inconsistent in the brief description given of the traumatic event?          10 month-olds don’t run.      It happened yesterday morning (delay in seeking medical attention).        History  Tom is the product of a full term delivery born to a 17 year old mother who is unmarried. She and the baby live with her grandmother. The 18 year old father is involved in the care of the baby. The infant’s birth weight was 3.89 kg (90%ile). The mother says that the infant is doing well but he has not yet received any immunizations. Tom does not have a family doctor. Tom was seen in the ER 2 months ago with an accidental ingestion of acetaminophen. Tom’s father was recently fired from his job.   Discuss the risk factors for child abuse and neglect that are evident from this history.          Young mother.      Child doesn’t have regular medical care.      Father has prior history of drug overdose.      Financial and psychosocial stressors.        Physical Exam  Tom is clearly in pain. Temperature is 36.8 C. There are bruises on the infant’s back, left buttock and the right thigh. There is tenderness over the right leg from the hip to the knee. The right leg looks slightly swollen. Tom will sit but will not bear weight or crawl. There is no rash or organomegaly. The diaper is soaked through.   What are the important findings in the physical exam?          Bruises in multiple locations.      Swelling and tenderness over leg.      The diaper is soaked through (suggestive of neglect).      No evidence of other causes (constitutional symptoms, etc).        An X-Ray shows a diaphyseal femoral fracture. Does this fit with the history given?          No, femur fractures in this age group are very rare, particularly since infants of this age are not ambulating.        Are there circumstances where a fall as described by the parents could result in a femoral fracture?          Probably not, unless they have some sort of bone pathology (Osteogenesis imperfecta, chronic steroid use, etc).        Are there any fractures which occur with simple falls in toddlers?          Yes; Toddler’s Fracture, spiral fracture of the distal tibia.      Metatarsal fractures are also common with simple falls.        What is the role of a physician when child abuse is suspected?          Mandatory reporting to CAS (Children’s Aid Society).        State some of the forms of abuse that a child may be subjected to.          Physical, emotional, psychological, neglect.        What factors may influence the under-reporting of child abuse by parents or otherpeople involved with the child’s care?          Denial, fear of the perpetrator, fear of retribution.      Not recognizing signs of abuse.      Not knowing how to report the abuse.      Avoiding the demands of becoming involved.      Having personal views which condone the use of physical punishment.      Not knowing that reports can be made anonymously, with no legal consequence.      Case #4  Case Summary  Yvette is an 11-year-old girl who comes to her family doctor’s office complaining of right knee pain. She limps into the office. The problem began approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain comes and goes, is worse with activity and if she bangs her knee. Yvette plays competitive soccer and is on the school basketball team. There is no history of trauma, joint swelling, rash, other affected joints, fever or malaise. Yvette has never been in hospital and has had no surgery. She is on no medication.   What diagnoses would you consider?          Osgood-Schlatter Disease      Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.      Trauma.      Rheumatologic disorder.      Slipped capital femoral epiphysis.        Physical Exam  On examination there is tenderness over the right tibial tuberosity with mild swelling. The other joints are normal. There is no rash or organomegaly. Yvette looks well. Temperature is 36.9°C   What do you think is the most likely diagnosis? Why?          Osgood-Schlatter Disease.      Most often seen in patients who actively participate in sports.        What test(s) would you order? Why?          XR, CBC-D, ESR, CRP.      We need to rule out more dangerous causes.        What is the cause of the most likely diagnosis?          Osgood–Schlatter disease (also known as apophysitis of the tibial tubercle or OSD) is an inflammation of the patellar ligament at the tibial tuberosity.      It is characterized by a painful lump just below the knee and is most often seen in young adolescents.      Risk factors include overuse (especially in sports involving running, jumping and quick changes of direction) and adolescent growth spurts.        What is the treatment of the most likely diagnosis? What is the prognosis?          Generally conservative with rest and ice.      specific exercises can be done to stretch the quads and hamstrings.      NSAIDs can be used for pain.      The prognosis is good.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/02/10/child-health-small-groups-child-limp.html"},

The second lecture has some videos of patient faces, which will be edited out out of the podcast.          These videos aren’t crucial for exam purposes.        The first hour will focus on pediatric trauma.  The second hour will focus on general pediatric orthopedics.Anatomical Differences in Children  Children are NOT little adults; there are key musculoskeletal differences.  Key musculoskeletal components that differ include:          Bone is more porous and pliable.      Periosteum → soft (osteogenic) tissue that surrounds the bone.                  In children, this is thicker and more active than in adults.          It also contributes to healing; this is why children generally heal faster and better with a fracture.          However, this large periosteum can sometimes get in the way when attempting to reduce a fracture.                    Physis → aka. Growth Plate.                  Seen as cartilage at ends of long bones.          These are a site of relative weakness.          Damage to the growth plate can result in growth and growth arrest issues.                    Anatomical Terminology  Epiphysis → above the physis (growth plate).  Physis → at the growth plate.  Metaphysis → recall that this was the box around the widest part of the bone.  Diaphysis → the shaft of the bone.  Apophysis → tendon insertion sites (ie. tubercles).Pediatric MSK Trauma  Most single extremity, generally minor.  Common mechanisms include falls from low heights, sport-related injuries, pedestrians struck by vehicles, NAI (non-accidental injury, aka. child abuse) infants/toddlers, vehicle operators (kids on ATVs, snowmobiles, etc).  Differences with Pediatric Trauma:          Because children’s bone is less dense and more porous, there is less comminution due to lower energy requirements for fracture.      Physeal (growth plate) fractures are a worry in children, but not adults.      Children are less likely to get ligament damage or dislocation.        Pediatric Fracture Types:          Buckle Fracture → incomplete fracture of the shaft of a long bone, with ‘bulging’ of the cortex on one side only.      Greenstick Fracture → similar to a buckle fracture (where the fracture is incomplete), but here the bone actually cracks, and you see bending on the other side of the bone.      Plastic deformation → no fracture line is seen, but the bone has been curved due to continuous microtrauma. These require treatment, even though there’s no fracture!      Physeal injury → will be discussed later.      Physeal InjuriesSalter-Harris Classification  The Salter-Harris Classification system is used to describe damage to the physis (growth plate).          It’s not necessary to remember this, but note that higher values correspond more severe damage to the growth plate.        A useful mnemonic to help remember the classification is SALTER itself!          S → Slip (separated/straight across): fracture of the physis only.      A → Above: fracture starts above the physis (metaphysis), and travels into it.      L → Lower: fracture starts below the physis (epiphysis), and travels into it.      TE → Through Everything: fracture goes through the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis.      R → Rammed: the growth plate is crushed.        Salter Mnemonic for Salter-Harris Classification      S → Slip (separated/straight across): fracture of the physis only.    A → Above: fracture starts above the physis (metaphysis), and travels into it.    L → Lower: fracture starts below the physis (epiphysis), and travels into it.    TE → Through Everything: fracture goes through the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis.    R → Rammed: the growth plate is crushed.

Discuss investigation, treatment to the most common problems.Review of Hip Anatomy  The medial femoral circumflex artery is what feeds the neck of the femur.  If you devascularize this, you put the patient at a high risk of avascular necrosis.  Innervation to the thigh:          The sciatic nerve innervates the posterior compartment.      The obturator nerve innervates the medial compartment.      The femoral nerve innervates the anterior compartment.        Recall that the femoral and obturator nerves only function above the knee, while the sciatic goes below the knee.  Recall that the sciatic nerve branches into the (1) tibial nerve, and (2) common fibular nerve (aka. peroneal nerve).          Branching of the sciatic nerve is highly variable.      It can divide above/at/below the piriformis muscle.      Differential Diagnosis for Hip Pain  Referred Pain from another System:          From Lumbar Spine → lumbar spinal stenosis, radiculopathy, myofascial/mechanical irritation, fractures.

	{"title": "PCCM Week 1 &ndash; Upper Limb", "text": "Approach to the MSK Exam  The MSK exam is organized as follows:          Look      Feel      Move      Special Tests      Neuromuscular Screen        To remember the things you look for, use the SEADS mnemonic:          S → Symmetry (or swelling).      E → Erythema.      A → Atrophy.      D → Deformities.      S → Scars.        When you’re feeling the area of interest, describe the surface anatomy, and any joints you feel.          Name everything you touch.      Work proximally to distally.        The neuromuscular screen involves looking at muscle bulk, tone, power, and symptom provocation:          Bulk → is the muscle bulk symmetric or asymmetric?      Tone → resistance to passive movement (spasticity, rigidity, flaccidity).                  Increased tone is seen with upper motor neuron problems.          Decreased tone is seen with lower motor neuron problems.                    Power → resistance with active movement.      Symptom provocation → is there pain with muscle contraction?        MRC (Medical Research Council) Grades for Power:          0 = No contractions.      1 = Muscle flickers.      2 = Muscle movement without gravity.      3 = Muscle movement against gravity only.      4 = Reduced power.      5 = Full power.      The Shoulder ExamLook  SEADS.  In particular, look at the shoulder from the posterior, and look for wasting of the supraspinatus or infraspinatus (hollowing out above or below the spine of the scapula).Feel  Start from the sternum, move along the clavicle, and feel both anterior and posterior landmarks.  Again, look for muscle wasting of the rotator cuff muscles (Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, etc).Move  Start with active movement, and ONLY do passive movement if there’s a problem with the active movement.          Flexion → have the patient bring their arms forward and above their head.      Extension → have the patient bring their arms backward.      Abduction/adduction → have the patient bring their arms out and back in.      Internal/external rotation → have the patient bring their elbows to their side, with their hands up. Have them move their arms out and back in.      Special Tests  Special tests for the shoulder assess 3 things:          Ligament Impingement      Ligament Irritation      Ligament Tears.        Tests for Ligament Impingement          Neer’s Test                  The examiner moves the arm through the full range of forward flexion or until reports of pain.          The sign is positive if there is pain with flexion.          See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8-yLHQ_JaM.                    Hawkins Kennedy Test                  The examiner places the patient’s arm shoulder in 90 degrees of shoulder flexion with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and then internally rotates the arm.          The test is considered to be positive if the patient experiences pain with internal rotation          See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU1xsUrKV4                    Painful Arc Test                  Have the patient abduct their arms in the plane of the scapula. The test is positive when there’s pain between 60 and 120 degrees of elevation (where the space between the humerus and the acromion is minimal, exacerbating impingement).          Note that unlike the Neer’s Test and the Hawkin’s Kennedy test, this is active, and not passive.                      Tests for Ligament Irritation          Supraspinatus Tendon                  This is assessed via the Empty Can Test.          See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjHOqydDhxo.          The test is positive when there’s pain when pressure is applied.                    Infraspinatus Tendon                   Bring the patient’s elbows to their sides, and have their hands facing outwards.          Push their arms in and have them resist.          This strains the infraspinatus since it’s an external rotator of the shoulder.          The test is positive if this elicits pain.                    Teres Minor                   This is the same test as with the infraspinatus, except in this case, have the patient’s arms up.          Again, bring the patient’s arms inwards, and have them resist.          The test is positive if this elicits pain.                    Subscapularis                   This ligament is somewhat more difficult to assess because it’s a medial rotator of the humerus.          To assess it, have the patient put their hands on their belly, and try to pull their arms away from their stomach.          Again, the test is positive if this elicits pain.                      Tests for Ligament Tears          Supraspinatus Tendon                  Since the supraspinatus is a shoulder abductor, passively abduct the patient’s arms for them, and then let go.          If there’s a supraspinatus tear, their arm will drop.          Hence, this is known as the Dropped arm test.                    Infraspinatus Tendon                  Here, passively externally rotate the patient’s arms with their elbows to their side.          When you release their arms, since the infraspinatus (an external rotator) is no longer there, the patient’s arms will slowly move medially.          This is known as a Lag Sign.                    Teres Minor                   This is another lag sign similar to the one with the infraspinatus tendon.          Here, passively move the patient’s arm to a position similar to the one where we assessed for ligament irritation.          When you release their arms, the patient’s arms will internally rotate such that their hands are in front of their mouth.          Hence this is known as the Hornblower’s Sign.                      Summary of the Shoulder Exam      Look → SEADS.    Feel    Move              Flexion/Extension.        Abduction/Adduction.        Internal/External Rotation.              Special Tests              Ligament Impingement:                      Neer’s Test            Hawkins Kennedy Test            Painful Arc Test                          Ligament Irritation:                      Supraspinatus (Empty Can Test)            Infraspinatus (arms down)            Teres Minor (arms up)            Subscapularis (hands on belly)                          Ligament Tears:                      Supraspinatus (Dropped Arm sign)            Infraspinatus (arms down + lag sign)            Teres Minor (arms up + lag sign; aka. the Hornblower’s sign)                              The Elbow ExamLook  SEADS.  Also look at the carrying angle: the angle at which the forearm attaches to the arm.          Normally, we all have a degree of valgus (the forearm normally attaches at an outward angle to the arm), and this is more prominent in women than in men.      It’s pathological when the angle is greater than 15°, or less than 5°.      Cubitus Valgus → where the joint angle exceeds 15°.      Cubitus Varus → where the joint angle is less than 5°. Also referred to as a Gunstock Deformity.        You can also look for the Popeye Sign (Vince!), which is suggestive of a tear of the biceps tendon          With the Popeye sign, because the biceps tendon is torn, the biceps muscle will clump up and look exaggerated (just like Popeye’s guns).      Feel  Feel the following structures:          Lateral epicondyle.      Medial epicondyle.      Olecranon.      Triangular Space.      Musculotendinous origins (the tendons of the muscles as they attach to the epicondyles).      Move  Start with active movement, and ONLY do passive movement if there’s a problem with the active movement.          Flexion (N = 150°)      Extension (N = 0°, ie. the arm is completely flat)      Supination (palms up).      Pronation (palms down).        To remember which direction is supination, imagine a poor boy holding his hands up for soup (soup = supination).Special Tests  Tests for Epicondylitis          Lateral Epidondylitis                  For these 2 tests, palpate the LATERAL EPICONDYLE, and have the patient’s palms FACING DOWN.          Perform the following:                          Resisted Wrist Extension (Cozen’s Test).              Passive Wrist Flexion (Mill’s Test).                                Either of the above signs is positive if there’s associated pain.          These tests rely on the fact that the forearm extensor muscles originate at the lateral epicondyle.                    Medial Epicondylitis                  For these 2 tests, palpate the MEDIAL EPICONDYLE, and have the patient’s palms FACING UP.          Perform the following:                          Passive Wrist Extension (no fancy name).              Resisted Wrist Flexion (Reverse Mill’s Test).                                These tests rely on the fact that the forearm flexor muscles originate at the medial epicondyle.                      Varus/Valgus Stress Tests          Have the patient supinated for the following tests.      Valgus Test                  Put one hand on the lateral side of the elbow, and use the other to push the forearm laterally.          This strains the ulnar (medial) collateral ligament.                    Varus Test                  Put one hand on the medial side of the elbow, and use the other to push the forearm medially.          This strains the radial (lateral) collateral ligament.                      Neurologic Tests          Tinel’s Sign → tap over the ulnar nerve just distal to the medial epicondyle to see if it elicits pain.      Note that this is different from Tinel’s sign in the wrist (tapping on the median nerve at the carpal tunnel). Tinel’s sign refers to the general approach of tapping a nerve to elicit paresthesiae.      Neuromuscular Tests  Assess muscle bulk, tone, power, and symptom provocation, as mentioned before.  Assess reflexes (triceps C6,7,8, biceps C5,6, and brachioradialis C5,6).  Summary of the Elbow Exam      Look → SEADS, carrying angle (varus/valgus).    Feel:              Lateral and medial epicondyle.        Olecranon.        Triangular space.        Musculotendinous origins.              Move              Flexion (N = 150°)        Extension (N = 0°)        Supination/Pronation.              Special Tests              Epicondylitis:                      Lateral Epicondylitis (feel lateral epicondyle, palms down):                              Resisted wrist extension (Cozen’s Test)                Passive wrist flexion (Mill’s Test)                                      Medial Epicondylitis (feel medial epicondyle, palms up):                              Passive wrist extension                Resisted wrist flexion (Reverse Mill’s Test)                                                    Varus/Valgus Stress Tests:                      Varus test → strain lateral ligament.            Valgus test → strain medial ligament.                          Neurologic Tests:                      Tinel’s Sign.                                Neuromuscular Tests              Muscle bulk, tone, power, and symptom provocation.        Assess reflexes (biceps, triceps, brachioradialis).            The Wrist ExamLook  SEADS  Nail changes, changes in hair distribution (may be suggestive of a vascular issue).Feel  Feel for all the bony landmarks (Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, Hamate).          Recall the mnemonic ‘Some Lovers Try Positions That They Can’t Handle’.        Feel for all the joints.Move  Wrist movements → flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, supination, pronation.  Finger movements (excluding little finger) → flexion, extension, adduction, abduction.  Thumb movements → flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, opposition.  Little finger movements → flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, opposition.Special Tests  Finkelstein’s Test          The examinar ulnar deviates the wrist (straining the radial side of the wrist).       If sharp pain occurs at the distal radius, then this is suggestive of De Quervain’s Tenosynovitis.        Tinel’s Sign          The examiner taps on the Carpal Tunnel to try to elicit median nerve irritation.      Pain is suggestive of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.        Phalen’s Test           Have the patient bring their wrists together in forced flexion (as shown to the right).      This increases the pressure in the carpal tunnel, and can also exacerbate irritation to the median nerve.      The test is positive if this elicits characteristic signs of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (such as burning, tingling or numb sensation over the thumb, index, and middle fingers).        Summary of the Wrist Exam      Look → SEADS, nail changes, changes in hair distribution.    Feel → bones, joints.    Move → (1) wrist, (2) fingers, (3) thumb, (4) little finger.              Make sure you include opposition for the thumb and little finger.

Case #1  Shoulder Dislocation  A 22 year-old university student comes to the Emergency Room after injuring his right shoulder in an intramural hockey game. On questioning, he tells you that he felt his shoulder go “pop” when he was hit hard from behind into the boards while reaching for the puck with his arm outstretched. He had to have help getting out of his equipment because he couldn’t move his arm, and was in extreme pain,, so he decided to come to the ER. On physical exam, there is a large bulge in the anterior shoulder, and the right arm slightly abducted and externally rotated. Passive range of motion of the shoulder is limited. The sensory neurologic exam of the left arm is normal. Pulses are present at the radial and brachial arteries.   What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?          Anterior Shoulder Dislocation.      Anterior dislocations are the most common, since there’s no bony protection (eg. the scapula).      Posterior dislocations are comparatively rare, unless caused by the 3 E’s:                  Epilepsy          Electric Shock          Ethanol                    Note that a separated shoulder ≠ a dislocated shoulder:                  Separated shoulder → AC joint dislocation          Dislocated shoulder → glenohumeral joint dislocation.                      What investigations should you do?          X-Ray, minimum 2 orthogonal views.        Patient X-Rays  Note that the humerus is disconnected from the glenoid cavity. Hence this is an anterior shoulder dislocation.  What is your initial management plan for this patient?          Reduction of the shoulder:                  You should do a full neurological exam both before and after the reduction.          This lets you know whether you caused any neurological problems, or if they were originally there.                    X-rays pre- and post- reduction                  This lets you know whether the reduction was effective or not.                      How would you reduce an anterior dislocation?          Many different methods; manipulation is more important than brute force.      Often the patient is supine, and external and rotation is applied to pop it back in.      Sometimes, when the patient is sedated and there’s reduced muscle tone, the shoulder will just pop back in.        What are your instructions for the patient at discharge?          Warn the patient of the risk of recurrence, particularly if they’re younger.      Put the patient in a shoulder sling for 1-3 weeks to prevent short-term dislocation.        What are indications for referral in the management of this patient?          Acute Indications → nerve or vessel problems, patient is an athlete, failure to reduce the shoulder.       Long-term Indications → multiple dislocations in the past.        What is the prognosis for this patient with respect to recovery and chance of recurrence?          The younger you are (&lt;20), the more likely you are to have a repeat dislocation.      Poor compliance with PT, or early return to work, also increases risk.      PT focuses on proprioception; it’s thought that this helps stabilize the shoulder and prevent recurrence.      Case #2  Wrist Fracture  A 51 year-old electrician comes into the emergency room complaining of severe wrist pain. A few hours ago, on her way home from school, she slipped on the stairs of her house and fell onto her outstretched hand. She tells you that she is in severe pain that has been unremitting since the fall. She tried icing her wrist but when she couldn’t bend her wrist decided she should come to the ER. On physical exam, her wrist is swollen and she refuses to move it because of the pain. There is a dinner-fork type deformity. Her neurovascular exam distal to the deformity is normal.   Patient X-Rays  Note the dinner fork deformity, shown in red.  Based on this patient’s presentation, what is your differential diagnosis?          Wrist Fracture → especially with a ‘dinner-fork deformity’.                  Dinner fork deformity → where the back of the arm isn’t straight, but actually dips and curves a bit (like the back of a dinner fork).                    Scaphoid Fracture.      Soft Tissue Injury.        What is your initial management plan for this patient?          X-rays, minimum 2 views.        Describe the x-ray.          Shown is a PA and lateral film of the right distal radius.      On the PA view, I see a communited distal radius, with radial shortening, and a decrease in radial angulation.      On the lateral film, I again see a distal radius fracture, extra-articular involvement, with dorsal angulation and radial shortening.      We know that there’s radial shortening because the ulna looks to be longer than the radius here. Normally, the radius is longer, so we know that shortening must have occurred.        What is your management plan?          Reduction, and casting.                  In this case, a circumferential, well-molded cast, is needed in order to maintain the reduction.                    Post-reduction X-rays.      Refer to orthopedics.        What are the most common complications of a distal radius fracture?          Nerve injury.      Compartment syndrome, if the cast is too tight.      Loss of reduction, if the cast is too loose.      Malunion → where healing occurs in the wrong position.      Wrist Stiffness → due to prolonged stasis of the wrist.        Post Reduction X-Rays  Post-reduction X-rays suggest that the fracture has been effectively reduced. There's no more dorsal angulation, the relative lengths of the radius and ulna are normal again, and there's no more 'dinner fork' deformity.Case #3  Hip Fracture  A 75 year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her grandson after falling down the steps of a restaurant. She tells you that she is in excruciating pain that started after she fell. You obtain details of the fall from the patient and her grandson and determine that: she missed a step going down approximately 5 stairs and landed on her left lateral hip; she did not lose consciousness before or after the fall; she did not hit her head; she tried to break her fall with her hands; her grandson and another restaurant patron helped her to her car; she does not have a history of previous falls or steroid use.   What are the most important initial steps in managing this patient?          Vitals.      Analgesics.      Hx and P/E, especially a neurologic exam.        What is your differential diagnosis for this patient’s presentation?          Femoral neck fracture → confirmed on XR.      Pubic rami fracture      Inter-trochanteric fracture.        What do you expect to find on physical exam for each of these potential diagnoses?          Inability to walk.      Pain with movement of the hip.      Inter-trochanteric may have bruising on skin.      One leg will be straight, the other will be flexed and externally rotated to maximize space in pelvic joint!?        What investigations will you order?          CT Scan to r/o occult fracture (eg. non-displaced hip fracture).                  In cases where no fracture is seen, but the clinical history is suggestive of one.                      How will you manage this patient?          Casting actually increases morbidity with hip fractures, because the stasis increases comorbidities, eg. DVT.      So the first choice here is surgery as opposed to casting.      With femoral neck fractures, also a high risk of AVN due to poor vascularization.      DVT prophylaxis is needed.      Rehab, social support, etc.      Case #4  Ankle Fracture  A 42 year-old lawyer comes to the emergency room after injuring his right ankle while hiking with his kids. Several bystanders helped him off the trail and drove him to your ER. His ankle is bleeding and there is a laceration approximately 3cm long on the anteromedial aspect of the leg above the medial malleolus.  The patient’s vitals are HR 95, BP 138/75, and temperature 37°C.   What is your initial management plan for this patient?          Same as before: Vitals, Analgesics, Hx and P/E (especially a neurologic exam).      Since this is an open fracture, we should also do the following:                  Antibiotics.          Tetanus prophylaxis          Debridement and irrigation of the wound.                      What investigations, if any, will you order?          Ankle X-Rays      Below, left is AP, right is lateral, and middle is ‘mortise view’. These 3 views are part of the ankle series.                  The mortise view allows you to visualize the joint surface nicely.          Similar to how you always take an axillary view with the shoulder, you always take a mortise view with the ankle.                    Note that there is a fracture of both the lateral and medial malleolus, with a resultant lateral displacement of the talus.         What are signs and symptoms of neurologic or vascular compromise you must watch for?          Pain that’s worsening and out of proportion with injury (eg. compartment injury).      Worsening numbness.      Skin discoloration.      Ecchymoses/swelling.        What are complications of open fractures?          Infection, both bone (osteomyelitis), or soft tissue infection (skin, soft tissue abcess).      Open fractures are surgical emergencies; surgery is always done to wash out wound.        Post ORIF XR  Case #5  Salter-Harris Fracture  A 10 year-old boy is carried by his father into the emergency room after the boy fell off of a trampoline while jumping with friends. Both are in obvious distress, and the boy is crying and unable to walk. His right leg is swollen around the ankle and distal tibia, but the skin is intact.  Salter-Harris Fracture → fracture of the growth plate.          With child, the growth plates are the weakest area of the bone.      So if you have a fracture, it’ll most likely propagate into the growth plate.        Patient XR    Describe the x-ray.          Fracture of the distal tibia, entering the growth plate.      The growth plate has a natural undulation; younger the patient, the wider the growth plate.        What is the Salter-Harris classification of fractures? What is its use?          The Salter-Harris classification is used to classify physeal (growth plate) injuries, and to help guide prognosis and management.      There are 5 categories in the classification, which can actually be remembered with the SALTER mnemonic.                  I → S → Slip (separated/straight across): fracture of the physis only.          II → A → Above: fracture starts above the physis (metaphysis), and travels into it.          III → L → Lower: fracture starts below the physis (epiphysis), and travels into it.          IV → TE → Through Everything: fracture goes through the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis.          V → R → Rammed: the growth plate is crushed.	                    Salter V injuries will affect growth potential, because the growth plate has been significantly damaged.        What is your management strategy for this patient?          Similar to before: analgesics, splints, reduction if required, pre- and post- neuro, pre- and post- XR, refer to ortho.      An important complication of any growth plate fracture is physeal arrest (growth plate no longer grows; affects growth potential).      Hence needs referral to peds ortho.      Case #6  Femure Fracture  A 30 year-old man is referred to you, the medical student in the emergency department, after being cleared by the trauma team for an isolated femur fracture following a motor vehicle accident. He has been given analgesia and his pain is reasonably controlled. He has a swollen thigh that is obviously deformed. His distal neurovascular exam is normal.  Describe the x-ray.          Laterally displaced diaphyseal femur fracture.        What is your initial management?          Same with everything else, but also check hemodynamic instability.      Routine vitals, routine Hb, see ortho right away.        Patients with femur fractures need to be treated surgically as soon as possible. Why?          There’s lots of blood supply near the femur itself, so there’s a risk of significant blood loss.      Can result in possible compartment syndrome due to fluid leakage.      Prolonged stasis also puts the patient at risk for DVTs, PEs, and fat emboli.      Faster surgery results in faster mobilization, which results in reduced complications.

	{"title": "Fracture Imaging", "text": "  Fractures Imaging Notes      See Fractures Imaging Notes.  Lecture Objectives  Be able to describe a fracture.  Recognize features of a pathological fracture.  Familiarity with imaging options:          When the anatomy is complex.      When XR is normal and fracture is suspected.      When soft tissue information is important.      Imaging Conventions  Perpendicular Films are taken          Usually a minimum of 2 views are needed.      Ideally, 3 orthogonal views are taken.      Describing Fractures  Similar to what was seen in the previous lecture.  Location → where is the fracture located on the bone.          Diaphysis → bone shaft.      Metaphysis → widening of the bone; defined as the square around the end of the bone with width equal to the widest part of the bone.      Epiphysis → rounded end of bone, at the joint.        Fracture Pattern:          Transverse → straight across the bone.      Comminution → more than 2 bone pieces. Usually seen with high energy fractures.                   If the amount of energy in the fracture doesn’t match the history, suspect a problem with the bone (eg. osteoporosis), or with the history (eg. abuse).                    Spiral → twisting fracture, due to rotationa force on limb.      Oblique → at an angle through the bone.        Displacement          By convention, describe the distal fragment relative to the proximal one.                  Since the proximal fragment is considered the ‘stable’ one, the distal fragment is described relative to it.          For example, ‘anterior dislocation of the fracture’ means that the distal fragment is dislocated anteriorly relative to the proximal one.                    Angulation → in degrees.      Translation → in mm.      Special Imaging  Special imaging = any imaging modality other than an X-ray.  Used in scenarios when:          The anatomy is complex → CT.      XR is normal and a fracture is still suspected → CT.      Soft tissue information is important → MRI.        In general, a CT scan is used when you want higher resolution assessment of the bone.  An MRI is used when you want to assess soft tissue.  Remember      A CT scan is used when you want higher resolution assessment of bone.    An MRI is used when you want to assess soft tissue.    What about bone scans?          Useful for assessing bone metabolism → where there’s rapid breakdown or formation of bone.      Hence this is useful for detecting:                  Arthritic activity.          Cancer.          Metabolic bone disease.                    Radiolabeled technetium is used.      What are the most common cancers that go to the bone?                  Metastases → most commonly from prostate, breast, lung.                    Pathological Fracture  Pathological fractures can be described as either stress fractures or insufficiency fractures:          Stress fracture → normal bone, abnormal stress.      Insufficiency fracture → abnormal bone, normal stress.        What are causes of insufficiency fractures?          Osteoporosis.      Kidney failure → secondary hyperparathyroidism → osteitis fibrosa cystica.      Metabolic bone disease → Paget’s, osteomalacia, etc.      Long-term steroid use.      Cancer.      Summary  Xray is a powerful diagnostic tool.  Remember the conventions for fracture description.  CT, Bone Scan, MRI and US can be used to supplement regular Xrays.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/29/fracture-imaging.html"},

Lecture Objectives  Understand basic principles of fracture management.  Be able to describe a fracture.  Understand the two types of fracture healing.  Know a bit about complications of fractures and fracture management.Introduction to Fractures  Fracture → Where so much pressure is applied to the bone that it undergoes deformation.  Healed fracture → Bone that can again withstand physiological force without deformation.  Describing fractures is important, as it gives you important information on the nature of the injury. It helps:          Classify the fracture.      Guide treatment.      Provide a prognosis for the injury.         Objective      Be able to describe a fracture.  What do you Include in a Fracture Description?  One common (and simple) classification of fractures is the ABC Classification:          A → Almost broken.      B → Broken.      C → Comin’ through the skin.        When describing a fracture more formally, characteristics that should be included are:          Location      Joint Surface Involvement      Displacement      Complexity      Fracture Pattern/Mechanism      Soft tissue Injury      Bone Quality      Unique Pediatric Fractures        Location:          Where is the fracture on the bone?                    Diaphysis → shaft of the bone.          Metaphysis → widened area of the bone. It can be circumscribed by drawing a square that just covers the widest part of the bone (see right).          Physis → in children only, this is the growth plate.          Epiphysis → end of the bone.                      Joint Surface Involvement          Does the fracture involve the surface of the joint or not?      If it does involve the joint surface, then a reduction must be more precise to preserve function.        Displacement          Has the bone moved or not?      If there is more than 1 fragment, by convention, we describe displacement of the distal fragment.      For instance, an anterior displacement of the fracture means that the distal fragment has displaced anteriorly to the proximal one.        Complexity          How many fragments are there?                  Single/non-comminuted → 1 fracture point, 2 pieces.          Comminuted → &gt;2 pieces.                    The higher the energy of the fracture, the more likely that it will be comminuted.         Fracture Pattern/Mechanism          Spiral Fractures → produced by torsional loads.      Transverse Fractures → produced by bending loads.      Wedge Fractures → produced by bending loads.      Comminuted Fractures → produced by axial loads.      Avulsion Fractures → Produced by traction loads.         Soft Tissue Injury          Closed fractures → the soft tissue envelope is intact with no environmental contamination.      Open fractures → the soft tissue envelope is disrupted and the internal zone of injury has been contaminated by the external environment.                  Open fractures have higher risks of complications (infections, nonunion) and poorer functional outcomes.          They require urgent surgical management to decontaminate the open wounds                       Bone Quality          A bone fracture can be pathologic or non-pathologic:                  Non-pathologic → fracture of a healthy bone.          Pathologic → fracture of an abnormal bone.                    Pathologic bone problems include osteoporosis, bone cysts, osteomalacia, Paget’s, etc.        Pediatric Features           Pediatric bone is softer and less brittle than adult bone.      As a result, instead of cracking, pediatric bone will often bend.      This results in a buckle or greenstick fracture; this is analogous to trying to break a ‘green branch’ (it bends rather than breaks).      Furthermore, if there’s physeal involvement (growth plate), then growth arrest may occur.        Objective      Understand the two types of fracture healing.  Fracture Healing  One important factor that guides your approach to treatment is whether you’re aiming for primary or secondary bone healing:          Primary  → bone remodelling occurs as if it was never broken.                  Here, the normal bone biology is uninterrupted, and remodelling occurs right over the fracture.          This is never seen without surgical intervention.                    Secondary → bone will grow around the fracture, via a multistage inflammatory mediated healing process.                  This is what happens with the majority of fracture healing.          Surgery is not necessary for secondary healing.                      Secondary healing is faster, but primary healing gives you better functional results.          Hence, for joint injuries, primary healing is the goal.      With bone fractures, we often use secondary healing instead.      You can always tell if a repair is aiming for primary vs secondary healing:                  If you see screws to maintain the stability of the reduction, it’s primary.           If you see nails, it’s secondary.                    Types of Fracture Healing                   Primary Bone Healing      Secondary Bone Healing                  Mechanism      Simple osteon remodelling      An inflammatory process              Used in      Fractures with joint involvement      Less complex bone fractures              Advantages            	      		Better results (no bone scar)      		No fracture callus.      	                  	      		Does not require surgery; can be done with casting      		Can still have a little bit of movement across the fracture site      	                    Disadvantages            	      		Needs surgery      		Requires very precise anatomic reduction      		Requires absolute stability      	                  	      		Will result in fracture callus in the short term      		Even long term, will still have a fracture line      	              Objective      Understand basic principles of fracture management.  Fracture Treatment  PHYSICAL EXAM AND INVESTIGATIONS          Physical Examination                  Soft tissue injuries.          Neurologic examination → it’s particularly important to do this before and after a reduction.          Vascular examination → pulses and perfusion.                    Investigations                  Start with plain radiographs (XRs)                          Image the entire bone.              Include the joint above, and the below.              Have multiple, perpendicular views.                                CT Scan → usually done after XRs, especially if the joint is involved.          MRI → usually not done with fractures due to cost/availability.                          The exception is with suspected spinal fractures, or when you want to look for soft tissue injury.                                            TREATMENT          Stabilization                  Pain medications.          Tetanus prophylaxis if open fracture or if there are significant lacerations.                    Reduction                  Closed → without surgery.          Open → with surgery.          An open approach is only done if the fracture involves the joint, or if it’s in a difficult to manipulate location (eg. the hip).                    Fixation                  Internal → External fixators, intramedullary devices, plates and screws.          External → Casts, splints, braces, (traction).                    Dealing with open fractures                  Open fractures are graded as:                          Grade 1              Grade 2              Grade 3 → 3A (no flap), 3B (flap), 3C (vascular injury).                                When dealing with an open fracture, the goal is to sterilize the area of injury and prevent infection:                          Tetanus prophylaxis.              Antibiotics.              Debridement and irrigation.              Early closure of the soft tissue envelope.                                            REHABILITATION          Early motion → reduces DVT risk and improves functional outcomes.      Protected weightbearing.      Physiotherapy.      Occupational therapy.        Objective      Know a bit about complications of fractures and fracture management.  1. Thromboembolic Disease  Risk factors → Virchow’s Triad:          Hypercoagulability      Vascular Injury      Stasis.        In other words, the typical orthopedic trauma patient.  Indications for DVT Prophylaxis:          Multiple injury.      Spinal cord injury.      Head injury.      Lower extremity or pelvic fx.      Older patient.      Prolonged surgery or wait for surgery.        DVT Prophylaxis:          Anticoagulation → Aspirin, LMWH, warfarin.      2. Compartment Syndrome  Compartment Syndrome → Excessive compartment pressure begins to cut off blood flow in compartment.  Causes damage, myonecrosis, and nerve injury.  Most commonly caused by internal pressure (eg. due to blood leaking into a fascial comparment); less commonly caused by external pressure.  The tissues most at risk are the metabolically active ones:          Nerve.      Muscle.        Easily treatable, but the consequences are very difficult to treat.          Transient muscle and nerve injury can occur with less than 2 hours of ischemia.      Permanent nerve and muscle injury occurs after 6 hours!        Clinical Signs:          Early → pain out of proportion to the injury, or with passive stretching of the muscles in the compartment.                  This can obviously be difficult to distinguish between simple swelling sometimes.          You can sometimes palpate for compartment ‘firmness’.          As soon as you see nerve issues then this is compartment syndrome until proven otherwise.                    Middle → paresthesia.      Late → paralysis.      Very late → loss of pulses.                  Once you lose your pulses, the tissue is probably dead.                      What do you do if you’re not sure if it’s compartment syndrome?          Compartment pressure measurements with an arterial line.      Indications:                  For patients who are uncooperative.          Equivocal clinical findings.                    Positive if:  ICP → Intra-compartment pressure. So if the difference between the diastolic blood pressure and the pressure in the compartment is less than 30, then that’s a positive finding.                   or          .                      Treatment of Compartment Syndrome:          Elevate limb.      Remove compressive dressings/casts.      Cool the limb and monitor closely.                  Urgent fasciotomy.                      Remember      As soon as you see nerve problems, it’s compartment syndrome until proven otherwise.    Permanent nerve and muscle damage will occur after 6 hours of ischemia.  3. Nonunion  Nonunion → failure of a fracture to heal in a period of time twice the time expected for that fracture to heal.  Classification:          Atrophic → there’s no healing. This is a biologic problem.      Oligotrophic → there’s little healing.      Hypertrophic → there’s enough healing, but the fracture just can’t finish healing. This is a mechanical problem; it needs stabilization (see right).      Infected → an infection is preventing the fracture from healing.        Treatment          Eradication infection, if any.      Stabilize the fracture if it’s a mechanical problem.      Biologic activation if it’s a biological problem.      4. Malunion  Malunion → improper healing of the fracture.          Seen in patients that didn’t seek medical attention, or if ORIF failed.        Evalulating Malunion (LART)          L → Length      A → Angulation      R → Rotation      T → Translation        These are the 4 planes in which malunion can occur.5. Osteonecrosis  Osteonecrosis → where the bone dies due to lack of blood supply.          Complication that’s unique to orthopedics.        Most common in bones with an intrinsic poor blood supply, that are prone to dislocation:          Femoral head.      Talus.      Scaphoid.

Understand the presentations of septic arthritis, cellulitis and crystal arthropathy.  Outline the initial management of septic arthritis.  Understand the three main variants of osteomyelitis.  Know the diagnostic features and management of osteomyelitis.  Outline the presentations and management of pyogenic spondylodiscitis.Important Points  All of the material is in the lecture notes linked above.          However, the important points are listed below.      1. Septic Arthritis  When a patient presents with monoarthritis, you HAVE to rule out septic arthritis.          If it’s not treated rapidly, the joint will be destroyed!      It’s more likely to be septic arthritis is the patient has persistent bacteremia, or they have an anatomic abnormality (eg. damaged/prosthetic joint).        The classical presentation of septic arthritis is a sudden onset of monoarthritis, typically in a weight bearing joint.          Migratory polyarthralgia (where multiple joints hurt, and the aching joints change over time) make it less likely to be septic arthritis.        DDx of monoarthritis + erythema:          Cellulitis → particularly if ROM near normal.                  This makes sense, since the infection is superficial.                    Septic Arthritis → ROM is never normal.                  This also makes sense, since the infection involves the joints.          If pain at rest, the Dx is septic arthritis until proven otherwise!!                    Crystal Arthropathy (eg. gout) → 90% male, usually &gt;30.                  Can be confusing; the only way to r/o gout is to aspirate the joint fluid and look for crystals.                      Septic arthritis has 2 classic patterns, depending on if its gonoococcal or nongonococcal:          Pattern 1 → sudden onset in older patient, no skin eruption → nongonococcal septic arthritis (or crystals).      Pattern 2 → prodrome, generalized skin eruption in younger patient (especially if pregnant or menstruating) → gonococcal septic arthritis.      However, there are many presentations that don’t fit into either pattern, so don’t box yourself in.        It’s important to separate gonococcal from nongonococcal causes because Neisseria gonorrhoeae often moves into the joints.          Neisseria gonorrhoeae used to be, by far, the most common cause of septic arthritis.      However, when HIV emerged in the late 20th century, the amount of casual sex dropped significantly, leading to a drop in the number of Neisseria infections.                  Now, the most common cause is probably Staph. aureus (ie. a non-gonococcal cause).                    Nonetheless, they can still be easily identified by falling into the pattern 2 type of behaviour.        Joint aspiration with WBC &gt; 50,000/µL is suggestive of septic arthritis          Also do a CBC, blood cultures.      Also assess the aspirate with a gram stain, culture, and look for crystals.      If pattern 2 (gonococcal), screen for STIs; urethral, cervical, rectal swabs.      2. Osteomyelitis  Osteomyelitis = infection in a bone.          As opposed to a joint infection (septic arthritis) as discussed before.      Osteomyelitis has 3 main etiologies:                  Hematogenous Osteomyelitis → spread of bacteria through the bloodstream.          From a contiguous focus → local spread.          Secondary to vascular insufficiency → bacterial growth due to blood stasis and no influx of immunologic factors.                    Hematogenous osteomyelitis is most comonly seen in the elderly, IDVUs, or with sickle cell.                  Here, systemic signs (high fever, chills) are common.                    From a contiguous focus is most commonly seen with penetrating wounds, compound fractures, and post ORIF.                  Here, systemic signs are uncommon, because the open wound helps drain the abscess.                    Secondary to vascular insufficiency is most commonly seen with diabetes.        Bone scans, MRI, and CT are more sensitive that XR for Osteomyelitis          XR early on are typically negative.      Bone scans are quite good for osteomyelitis, especially for early infections where XR is negative. The bone will ‘light-up’.        Bone biopsies should be done for C&amp;S unless there’s a positive blood culture          If you have a blood culture result, you don’t need the bone biopsy to determine the treatment.      However, you cannot substitute a bone biopsy with a wound culture because there are so many other obfuscating organisms there.      Guessing the antibiotic to use is dangerous; oftentimes the patient will improve, but it won’t completely resolve. This then becomes much harder to treat.        Treatment is as follows:          Surgical debridement of necrotic bone, with removal of all sequestra (eg. hardware, cement).      4-6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, based on bone biopsy C&amp;S or blood C&amp;S.      Follow ESR until resolution.        ESR can be used to follow response to treatment          As the ESR falls, you know that your Abx treatment is working.      If the patient is immunocompetent, and doesn’t have any vascular insufficiency, prognosis is very good.      3. Pyogenic Spondylodiscitis  Pyogenic Spondylodiscitis → basically infection of the vertebral discs themselves, so this is a form of vertebral osteomyelitis.          In adults, this is either hematogenous, or iatrogenic (eg. after spine surgery).      In children, spontaneous infection sometimes occurs.        Pyogenic Spondylodiscitis is difficult to catch early on          Symptoms are non-specific: pain is most common, with fever and radicular symptoms in only 50% of patients.      Can often be mistaken for DDD, cancer, herniation, or inflammatory diseases.        Treatment is similar to general osteomyelitis          Culture + 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy + spinal immobilization.      With immobilization, you need DVT prophylaxis to prevent a possible PE.      Surgery is done if the patient fails to respond to conservative Tx, if there’s progressive neurological deficits, or significant vertebral damage.

	{"title": "Approach to the Arm, Wrist & Hand", "text": "  Arm, Wrist &amp; Hand Notes      See Arm, Wrist &amp; Hand Notes.  Lecture Objectives  To provide a rational approach to hand and wrist disorders.  To discuss common hand and wrist problems including:          Distal radius fractures.      Scaphoid fractures.      Infections.      General Approach  Depending on the timeframe of the injury, different etiologies for the injury are suspected.  Acute Problems:          Fractures      Dislocations      Infections        Chronic Problems:          Tendonosis      Arthrosis      Nerve compression      Distal Radius Fractures  Very common injury.  Typically arises from FOOSH → Falling on an Outstretched Hand.  General findings → localized pain, with possible associated injuries:          Ligament tear.      Scaphoid fracture.        The forearm will have poor function if the anatomy is not restored.Imaging of Distal Radius Fractures  What X-Rays would you order for a suspected radius fracture?          PA view.      Lateral view.        There are 3 parameters you need to assess:          Radial length → how long is the radius versus the ulna?      Articular angle → with lateral view.      Articular surface      1. Radial Length  The radius should be a little longer than the ulna normally.  If this isn’t the case, then the radius is probably fractured, and has collapsed.  This can be assessed with the ulnar variance, which assesses the relative positions of the surfaces of the radius and ulna where they articulate.  This can either be neutral, positive, or negative:          Neutral → both the ulnar and radial articular surfaces are at the same level.      Positive → ulna projects more distally.      Negative → ulna projects more proximally.        If there’s a significant difference in the ulnar variance in one wrist versus the contralateral one, it’s more suspicious for a fracture.  If the radius collapses enough, over time there may be an ulnar impaction syndrome:          This is where the relative length of the ulna allows it to impact against the bones and ligaments of the carpus.          Note the lines on the XR on the left. These reflect the relative positions of the ulna and radius where they articulate; the ulnar variance. On the right, notice the presence of an ulnar impaction syndrome.  2. Articular Angle  The angle at which the radius meets the carpus should not be crooked.          Normally, the articular surface should be angled towards the palm (see the black lines in the image to the right).      More specifically, this is considered 12° of palmar flexion on a lateral XR.      0° of palmar flexion is considered to be ‘neutral’.      An abnormally finding is anything past 0° of dorsiflexion.        What happens if the articular surface is at an angle?          The motion of the distal radio-ulnar joint is altered.      Because an abnormal angle increases the gap between the two bones it makes it harder to rotate the radius with respect to the ulna.      This restricts forearm rotation.          Remember      The normal articular angle with a lateral XR is 12° of palmar flexion.    Any degree of dorsiflexion is considered abnormal.  3. Articular Surface  The articular surface of the radius should be smooth.          &gt;1mm step deformity is associated with post traumatic arthrosis, because it results in irregular joint wear.                  Note that arthrosis = osteoarthritis.          Post traumatic osteoarthritis is not the same as degenerative osteoarthritis; as the name suggests, post-trumatic OA is caused by an injury.                    If the joint surface is too irregular, it can cause radiocarpal arthritis, which will result in pain and stiffness, and may require surgery.      Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures  Treatment proceeds as follows:          Adequate Analgesia      Reduction      Fixation        Adequate Analgesia → options include:          Hematoma block → any time you have a bone fracture, there’s a hematoma. With a hematoma block, you inject anesthetic (typically lidocaine) into the hematoma.      Regional anesthesia → numbing the entire arm.      Conscious sedation → put the patient to sleep. Often not used in adults unless larger joints are involved. For the wrist, really only used in children.        Reduction → restoring the normal anatomy of the fractured bones.          Traction.      Increase the deformity → seems counterintuitive, but the purpose of this is to help dislodge fragments.      Correct the deformity      Cast      Xray        Fixation → keep the reduction in place.          Internal Fixation → use implants such as screws or pins to keep the bones together from the inside.      External Fixation → use casts or other external structures to keep the bones together from the outside.      Scaphoid Fractures  Most common carpal bone fracture.  Also often seen with FOOSH.  Usually heals uneventfully.  Sometimes can be difficult to diagnose.          Delayed diagnosis is associated with complications.        General findings → swelling, localized tenderness.Imaging of Scaphoid Fractures  XR is usually sufficient, but not completely sensitive.          Sometimes the patient may have snuff box pain (where the waist of the scaphoid is located), but the XR is negative.      In these cases, you’re often treated as if it was fractured, because the risk of missing the diagnosis exceeds the risks of immobilization.        So if clinical suspicion is high and XRs are normal:          Treat as if fractured.      Get additional imaging → CT, MRI, bone scan.      Treatment of Scaphoid Fractures  Treatment depends on if the fracture is displaced or not:          Undisplaced → cast until union.                  Unlike with distal radius fractures, casting involves immobilizing the thumb as well.                    Displaced → surgery to bring things back to their normal position.                  Surgery is done via a volar (palmar) approach, and typically involves placing a single screw inside the bone.                      The scaphoid bone is fairly unique in that is has a retrograde blood flow:            What this means is that the blood supply to the scaphoid comes distally, as opposed to proximally.      As a result, proximal scaphoid fractures heal more poorly; if they do heal, it takes much longer.      Proximal fractures also carry a risk of nonunion and osteonecrosis (ie. AVN).        Hence, the most common complications of scaphoid fractures are related to this retrograde blood flow:          Nonunion → particularly with proximal fractures.      Osteonecrosis → AVN due to lack of blood supply proximally.      Late arthrosis → if the proximal region dies, then it can lead to OA.      Hand Infections  The hand is anatomically predisposed to abscess formation:          It has many joints, all of which are subcutaneous.      It has a lot of discrete anatomical compartments:                  Tendon sheaths.          Thenar eminence.          Pulp space.          Within the nails.                    The key is to differentiate cellulitis from an abcess, because their treatment is different:                  Cellulitis → superficial skin infection.          Abscess → deep tissue infection.          An abscess needs to be drained; a cellulitis does not.                      Cellulitis vs Abscess                    Cellulitis        Abscess                            Superficial skin infection        Deep tissue infection                    Wrist to MCP Joints        Finger tips                    Dorsal surface        Around the joints                    Margins are irregular        Palmar surface involvement            Examples of Joint Infections  Cat Bites           Cat bites are more dangerous than dog bites because they more often puncture the skin, and inoculate bacteria deeper in.      Typically at the PIP and DIP joints.      Often a mixed infection.      Tx must cover Pasteurella multocida.      Broad spectrum Abx.        Human ‘Bites’           Often seen with young men who get into fights, and teeth are punched.      Typically at the MCP joint.      Mixed flora, as with cat bites.      Tx must cover Eikenella corrodens.      Broad spectrum Abx.        Paronychia           aka. a nail fold infection.      F &gt; M, probably due to manicures being more common in women.      Most common organisms is S. aureus.                  If immunocompromised, may have fungi.                      Felon           Felon → pulp space infection (pronounced fee-lon, not fell-on, like the other felon).      These are little abscesses of the pulps of the finger, and, like other abscesses, these require drainage.        Suppurative Tenosynovitis          Recall that tendonitis is inflammation of the tendon, while tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath.      A suppurative tenosynovitis is thus an infectious inflammation of the tendon sheaths.                  This is almost always flexor tenosynovitis; the flexor compartment has more defined synovial sheaths compared to the extensor compartment.          Suppurative tenosynovitis is a surgical emergency.                    There are 4 cardinal signs of Suppurative Tenosynovitis (Kanavel’s 4 signs):  The patient’s hand remains in flexion because it increases the space within the tendon sheath, and reduces pain. Pain with extension thus occurs because it reduces this space.                  Swelling of the entire finger.          Flexion posture.          Tenderness along the tendon sheath.          Intense pain during extension.                    An example of a patient with suppurative tenosynovitis is shown below.      As with other abscesses, treatment involves surgical drainage (in the OR), wound care, and Abx.  Note the flexion of the hand, and the swelling of the entire finger. This patient would also have tenderness along the sheaths, and pain with extension.        Kanavel’s Four Cardinal Signs      Kanavel’s 4 Cardinal Signs relate to the presence of suppurative tenosynovitis.              Swelling of the entire finger.        Flexion posture.        Tenderness along the tendon sheath.        Intense pain during extension.            Treatment of Joint Infections  Catch these early.  With all abscesses, the treatment is as follows:          Surgical drainage.      Wound care (debridement, irrigation).      Antibiotics (broad spectrum).        With a cellulitis, antibiotics are sufficient on their own.Applied Example  What is seen in the above XR?  A general approach to reading XRs is as follows:          State what you’re looking at:                  What views?          What structure is being looked at?          Example → this is an AP and lateral view of the right distal radius.                    State what’s wrong                  Describe what you see for each film.          For example:                          “On the AP film, I see a comminuted fracture of the distal radius, and the articular surface seems to be irregular.”              “On the lateral film, I see dorsal angulation of the joint surface, as well as translation.”                                In this case, the distal radius fracture causes the wrist surface to curve like the back of a dinner fork; this is known as a dinner fork deformity.                          The fracture that causes a dinner fork deformity (fracture of the distal radius with dorsal displacement of the radius) is known as Colle’s fracture.                                            The patient had tingling in the thumb, index, and long fingers. What did he have?          Acute CTS due to a compression of the median nerve.      Importantly, you always have to do a neuromuscular exam before and after reduction.      This lets you know whether you caused an injury or not.        Remember      Always do a neuromuscular exam both before and after a reduction.  ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/28/approach-arm-wrist-hand.html"},

	{"title": "Workplace Injuries and WSIB", "text": "Lecture Outline  Overview of the WSIB  Concepts and strategies          For workplace injuries and WSIB claims                  Assessment → Is a condition work-related?          Treatment → Is a treatment covered?          Functional abilities → Is return to work possible?                      Case exampleWhat is the WSIB?  WSIB → Workplace Safety &amp; Insurance Board.          Founded in 1914 by the Ontario government.      Crown corporation; owned by the government.      Functions like an insurance company; business pay money to cover their employees for work-related injuries.        Provides disability insurance for workplace injuries and illnesses          Used by businesses and their employees.      Benefits that the WSIB offers include income replacement, health care, and retraining.      Funded entirely by employer premiums.                  The premiums that an employer has to pay is determined by its claims statistics; much like with personal insurance, if you have a lot of costly injuries, your premiums will go up.                    The WSIB has a no fault system, and was built on an ‘historic compromise’ between workers and employees:                   Workers compromise by giving up the right to sue, even if the accident was clearly the fault of the employer. Payment is instead be determined by the WSIB.          Employers compromise by giving up the right to opt out, so all employers must pay money to the WSIB.          There are a few exceptions where employers are allowed to opt out: banks, doctors offices, hairstylists (?), taxidermy (??), etc.                    The Claims Process  With every claim, there are 2 key parties: the worker and the employer.          Both the worker and the employer have a duty to report a workplace injury to the WSIB.        Where to clinicians play a role then?          Clinicians have a duty to provide the clinical information that’s necessary to make a decision on the claim that’s being made.      The WSIB case manager makes decisions based on the information provided.        Both employees and employers have a right to appeal          There’s a 3-stage appeals process that’s available to them.      WSIB Forms  3 of the common forms that are used by the WSIB are:          Form 8 (F8) → this is the one that health professionals fill out.      Functional Abilities Form (FAF) → this is the one that workers/employers fill out.      Progress Report (F26) → this is the one that the WSIB fills out.        Since we’re discussing the WSIB from the perspective of a health professional, we’ll be focusing only on the Form 8.  With respect to the worker/employer initiated FAF form:          The employer must report a work-related accident within 3 days.      The worker must report a work-related accident within 3 months.                  This deadline is more flexible because it may take longer for the injury to manifest itself.                      As healthcare professionals, we cannot report a workplace accident without the permission of the worker.          There’s a spot on the Form 8 where the patient must sign to indicate consent to report.      The Form 8What is the Form 8?  The Form 8 provides clinical information in 5 general areas:            Hx → History.      Px → Physical findings.      Dx → Diagnosis.      Tx → Treatment plan.      Fx → Functional abilities.        For today’s presentation, we’ll be focusing on the Hx and Fx components of the Form 8.History  Looks at the question ‘is a condition work related?’.  With the history, you should include these 2 components:          Mechanism of injury      Risk factors        Mechanism of Injury          What was happening to the body at the time of the injury?      With respect to MSK injuries (the bulk of workplace injuries), there are 2 basic mechanisms: a single event, or prolonged exposure.                  Single event → position, angle, force, weight, timing, speed, distance, constraints, etc.          Prolonged exposure → additional temporal factors such as duration, frequency, repetition, etc.                    You should also note the presence of vulnerable movements; examples include:                  Neck → acceleration/deceleration.          Shoulder → overhead work.          Wrist → prolonged flexion/gripping.          Low back → heavy lifting with flexion.          Knee → twisting movements.                      Risk Factors:          Stratify these risk factors into occupational and non-occupational ones.                  Non-occupational → smoking, alcohol, diabetes, family history, gender, infection, menopause, obesity, etc.          Occupational → prolonged flexion, repetitive movement, vibration, etc.                    Functional Abilities  Looks at the question ‘is return to work possible?’.          Can we match the functional abilities of the worker with the demands with a safe and appropriate work option?      With impaired functional abilities, matching may involve modifying the type of work, or retraining the worker for a new job.        With the assessment of functional abilities, you should include these 2 components:          Specifying abilities.      Discussing recovery.        Specifying Abilities          What can the patient do? → what activities are safe and appropriate for the worker to attempt, on a trial basis?      What can’t the patient do? → what activities are unsafe or contraindicated from a medical point of view?    An example of how to specify the abilities of the patient. Note that we note things that the patient can do, as well as what they can't do. Things are also described in a very general fashion.        Discussing Recovery          Foster a recovery mindset; highlight what the patient can do, not what they can’t.                  Discuss with them the benefits of staying active.          Discuss the benefits of staying connected with work.          Set expectations and timeframes for improvement.                    Help the patient find a way to stay at work:                  Patients that stay at work generally have faster, more complete recoveries; there’s an important psychosocial impact in ‘having a purpose’.                    Going back to work early also makes it less likely that you’ll drop out of the workforce:                  Patients that are away from work for over 6 months only have a 50% chance of ever working again.          Patients that are away from work for over 12 months only have a 25% chance of ever working again.          Patients that are away from work for over 2 years have an almost 0% chance of ever working again.                    Help the patient stay positive and avoid the vicious cycle.                  Patient has symptoms          This leads to specific mindset          This drives behaviour that exacerbates the symptoms.                      Avoid magnifying problems; this can often change an impairment to a disability.                  Impairment → a change or problem with the body’s structure or function (physical or mental).          Disability → an inability to perform important activities and roles in one’s life, eg. a loss of earning capacity.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Hand", "text": "A. Bones of the Hand  Carpal-Metacarpal Joints (CMC) → joints between the carpal and metacarpals.  Metacarpal-Phalangeal Joint (MP) → joints between metacarpals and phalanges (knuckles)  Interphalangeal Joints (IP) → joints between phalanges (proximal, middle, distal)          The joints between the proximal and middle phalanges are the proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPs).      The joints between the middle and distal phalanges are the distal interphalangeal joints (DIPs).        Trapezium-1st Metacarpal Joint → different type of joint from the other MP joints, forming a saddle joint allowing for 2 planes of rotation. This is why the thumb can move in multiple planes.  Carpal Bones:          There are 8 carpal bones, arranged in 2 rows.      Mnemonic = Some Lovers Try Positions That They Can’t Handle.                    Scaphoid          Lunate          Triquetrum          Pisiform          Trapezium          Trapezoid          Capitate          Hamate                    S → P = row one from lateral to medial (proximal row).      T → H = row two from lateral to medial (distal row).        Hamate has a hook that projects onto the palmar surface to which the flexor retinaculum attaches and on the other side, the flexor retinaculum attaches to the scaphoid bone.  Scaphoid only receives blood supply from one side (distally). So if there’s a fracture of the scaphoid, it’s at high risk for avascular necrosis, and poor healing.  Therefore the real depth of the carpal tunnel is comprised of pisiform, triquetral, hamate, and scaphoid bones  Metacarpals are numbered lateral to medial (aka Thumb = 1)  Sesamoid Bones → well circumscribed round bones which variably form along the flexor pollicis longus or along other tendons within the hand.          These are bones that are embedded within the tendon of a muscle. A classic example is the patella.      They function as pulleys; they provide a smooth surface with which the tendon can slide on, improving force transmission.      Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand  The extrinsic muscles of the hand (ie. the ones that go from the forearm to the hand) mediate powerful hand motions.  The intrinsic muscles of the hand (ie. the ones that both originate and attach within the hand) mediate precise hand motions.  The intrinsic muscles of the hand are classified into 3 groups:          Palmar → the muscles in the palm itself.      Thenar → the muscles in the lateral pad of the palm, that control the thumb.      Hypothenar → the muscles in the medial pad of the palm, that control the pinky.        All of the intrinsic muscles of the hand are innervated by the ulnar nerve (deep branch), with 4 exceptions, which are innervated by the median nerve:          Lumbricals 1 and 2.      Opponens Pollicis      Abductor Pollicis Brevis.      Flexor Pollicis Brevis.        Collectively, these form the ‘LOAF’’ muscles.  The ‘LOAF’ Muscles      The LOAF muscles are:              L → Lumbricals 1 and 2        O → Opponens Pollicis        A → Abductor Pollicis Brevis        F → Flexor Pollicis Brevis              These are the only intrinsic muscles of the hand that are innervated by the median nerve    Everything else is innervated by branches of the ulnar nerve.  B. Intrinsic Palmar Muscles of the Hand  Palmar Muscles → the muscles of the palm itself. Grouped into 3 sets:          Dorsal Interossei (x4)      Palmar Interossei (x3)      Lumbricals (x4)      1. Dorsal Interossei (DAB) x4  O → sides of metacarpals of all 4 intermetacarpal spaces  I → ipsilateral proximal phalanges  A → Abduction of digits 2, 3, and 4 (the abductor digitis minimi does the pinky).  N → Deep branch of ulnar nerve (C8, T1)  Clinical → bilateral on middle finger, all bipennate muscles  Note: The middle finger has a dorsal interossei on both sides; hence the ring and index fingers abduct away from the middle finger.2. Palmar Interossei (PAD) x 3  O → single metacarpals in medial three intermetacarpal spaces  I → proximal phalanx and extensor expansion  A → Adduction of fingers (digits 2, 4, 5) towards middle finger.  N → Deep branch of ulnar nerve (C8, T1)  Clinical → all unipennate muscles.  Note: The middle finger has no palmar interossei; instead (as mentioned before), it has 2 dorsal interossei.          Also, the pinky has a palmar interossei, but not a dorsal interossei.      3. Lumbricals*  O → Flexor digitorum profundus  I → Extensor expansion  A → Flexion at MCP and Extension at IP  N → 1/2 median nerve, 3/4 ulnar nerve          Recall that Lumbricals 1 &amp; 2 were part of the LOAF muscles.        Clinical → digits 2 and 3 are unipennate, digits 4 and 5 are bipennate  Note → there are 4 lumbricals, lumbricals 1 is attached to the 2nd digit, lumbricals 2 is attached to the 3rd digit, etc.             Since the muscles originate on the palmar surface, and go past the metacarpophalygeal joint, they cause flexion at the MCP joint.      Since the muscles attach to the dorsal surface, on the extensor expansion, they actually cause extension of the IP joints.      Because the muscles wrap around from the palmar to dorsal side, they mediate hand motion as shown to the right.        DAB vs PAD      DAB → Dorsal ABduct (orange on diagram).    PAD → Palmar ADduct (pink on diagram).    The middle finger has 2 dorsal interossei and no palmar interossei.  C. Intrinsic Thenar Muscles of the Hand  Thenar Muscles → a set of 4 muscles that form the lateral pad on your palm; these all control the motion of the thumb.          Opponens Pollicis      Abductor Pollicis Brevis      Flexor Pollicis Brevis      Adductor Pollicis.        The first 3 were LOAF muscles (innervated by the median nerve).          More specifically, it’s the recurrent branch of the median nerve.      1. Abductor Pollicis Brevis*  O → Flexor retinaculum and tubercles of scaphoid and trapezium  I → Lateral base of proximal phalanx of thumb  A → ABDUCTS thumb and helps oppose it  N → Recurrent branch of median nerve2. Flexor Pollicis Brevis*  O → Flexor retinaculum and tubercles of scaphoid and trapezium  I → lateral base of proximal phalanx of thumb  A → Flexes thumb  N → Recurrent branch of median nerve3. Opponens Pollicis*  O → Flexor retinaculum and tubercles of scaphoid and trapezium  I → Lateral side of 1st metacarpal  A → Brings thumb laterally to oppose  N → Recurrent branch of median nerve4. Adductor Pollicis  O → Differs depending on the head.          Oblique Head: base of 2nd and 3rd metacarpals, capitate, and 	adjacent carpals       Transverse Head: anterior of 3rd metacarpals        I → medial side of proximal phalanx of thumb  A → draws 1st metacarpal laterally to oppose and adduct thumb  N → Deep branch of Ulnar Nerve (C8, T1)  Note: Often considered as the 4th palmar interosseous (since it ADducts the thumb; PAD).  Note      *: LOAF Muscles    Opponens pollicis → deep to, and in the middle of both APB and FPB.    Abductor pollics brevis → more lateral.    Flexor pollicis brevis → more medial.  D. Intrinsic Hypothenar Muscles of the Hand  Hypothenar Muscles → a set of 3 muscles that form the medial pad on your palm; these all control the motion of the pinky finger.          Abductor Digiti Minimi      Opponens Digiti Minimi      Flexor Digiti Minimi Brevis      1. Abductor Digiti Minimi  O → Pisiform  I → medial side of proximal phalanx of 5th digit  A → Abduction of little finger  N → Deep branch of ulnar nerve2. Opponens Digiti Minimi  O → Hook of hamate and flexor retinaculum  I → medial border of 5th metacarpal  A → opposition; draws 5th metacarpal anteriorly and rotates it, opposes pinky and thumb  N → Deep branch of Ulnar Nerve (C8, T1)Note that brevis is usually included to differentiate a muscle from a longus muscle of the same name. The flexor digiti minimi longus, however, is not found in the typical human, but instead is a rare anatomical variation.3. Flexor Digiti Minimi Brevis  O → Hook of hamate and flexor retinaculum  I → medial base of proximal phalanx of 5th digit  A → flexion of proximal phalanx of 5th digit  N → Deep branch of Ulnar Nerve (C8, T1)   Notes: Opposes the action of the extensor digiti minimi (superficial muscle of the posterior forearm).E. Fascial Layers of the Hand  Flexor Retinaculum → facial band between the hamate and scaphoid carpal bones.  Flexor Synovial Sheaths → covers the long flexor tendons of the hand.            Digits 2-4 have separate distinct sheaths      Digit 1 has separate distinct sheath that goes through the carpal tunnel into the forearm      Digit 5 has sheath which connects to the sheath of the lower half of the long tendons and continues into the forearm via the carpal tunnel      Clinical → Tenosynovitis infections in either the 1st and 5th digit can track back up into the forearm since they’re continuous with spaces in the forearm (see right). However, this is not the case for digits 2-4, because the sheaths are separate.        Fibrous Flexor Sheath → surrounds IP joints for digits 2-5 (shown in green).  Extensor Expansion (Extensor Hood) → covers the extensor surfaces of the MP and IP joints; but has openings that allow for insertion of intrinsic and extrinsic extensor muscles. F. Fascial Compartments of the Hand  Palmar Aponeurosis (central compartment) → connected to the palmaris longus tendon located in the middle of the palm,            Clinical → Dupuytren’s Contracture: palmar aponeurosis undergoes thickening leading to contracture, starting with nodules and cords in the skin.      Flexure of 4th and 5th digits is most common, accompanied by dimpling of the skin near palmar crease of affected digits. Often impairs function of hand.        Thenar Compartment → formed by lateral septum (thumb)  Hypothenar Compartment → formed by medial septum (5th digit)G. Arterial Supply of the Hand  Hand receives arterial supply from ulnar (medial) and radial (lateral) arteries.  Branches of Radial Artery:          Princeps Pollicis Artery → pierces adductor pollicis to supply thenar muscles.      Radialis Indicis Artery → supplies 2nd digit (index finger) with blood      Deep Palmar Arch → mainly supplied by radial artery but does join deep branch of ulnar artery to form a combined atch.        Ulnar artery comprises the majority of the superficial palmar arch  Common Digital Arteries branch off the superficial palmar arch and anastomose with Palmar Metacarpal Arteries off the deep palmar arch to form Proper Digital Arteries.          Hence, each of the arteries to the fingers (the ‘proper’ digital arteries) have a dual supply from both the radial and ulnar artery, via the deep and superficial palmar arches respectively.        Proper Digital Arteries travel up each side of the digits 2-5, meeting at the tip to supply the fingers with bloodH. Venous Drainage of the Hand  Highly variable from person to person.  Medially blood drains into the Basillic Vein.  Laterally blood drains into the Cephalic Vein.  Both the basillic and cephalic veins drain into the axillary vein.  Median Cubital Vein → communication vein between cephalic and basillic veins.  Median Antebrachial Vein → drains the forearm.  Brachial Vein → drains upper arm.I. Innervation of the Hand  Motor Innervation          Ulnar Nerve → all intrinsic muscles of the hand except for LOAF muscles      Median Nerve → LOAF muscles      Extrinsic Muscle innervation see forearm lecture:                  Recall that flexors are generally innervated by the median nerve (except for the flexor carpi ulnaris and half of the flexor digitorum profundus).          Recall that extensors are all innervated by the radial nerve (most via the posterior interosseous nerve, except for the extensor carpi radialis longus, which is via the radial directly.                      Sensory Innervation          Nerve Testing: best spots on hand for testing different nerve function.                   In spite of the overlap and variation in sensory innervation, there are certain areas in the hand where cutaneous innervation is fairly consistent; these are known as the autonomous zones.                    These consist of the following:                  Median Nerve → index finger (2nd digit)          Ulnar Nerve → pinky finger (5th digit)          Radial Nerve → web of thumb (between 1st and 2nd digit)                    J. Movements of the Hand  Flexion → bending of the thumb to the medial palm  Extension → movement of the thumb laterally in the plane of the palm  Adduction → movement of thumb towards side of palm  Abduction → movement of thumb perpendicular to the plane of the palm  Opposition → touch pulp of thumb to pulp of other digits (pulp = pad of fingers)", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/27/anatomy-hand.html"},

How can we tell if nerves are going to recover spontaneously?  If they are not recovering, when and how should we fix them?  Objective      How are nerves injured?    Acute Causes          Penetrating injuries → knife, gun shot wound.      Blunt injuries → nerve stretching, or crush.                  Common causes of nerve stretching include motorcycle, ATV, and snowmobile accidents, which can result in stretching of the brachial plexus.                      Chronic Causes          Compression → eg. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.      Metabolic → B12 deficiency, DM.      Infectious → leprosy (most common cause of nerve injury worldwide).      Radiation        Objective      How can we tell if/where a nerve is injured?    History → areas of numbness/paresthesiae.  Physical Exam → focus on anatomy; which nerve(s) are at risk?          Motor → assess which muscles have lost function.      Sensory → assess which dermatomes have lost sensation.        Adjunctive Tests          EMG.      Imaging.      Case Example  A patient presents with the following:          0/5 power to biceps.      0/5 power to supraspinatus.      0/5 power to deltoid.      4/5 power to triceps.      5/5 power to thenar eminence.        What nerves are involved?          Biceps → musculocutaneous nerve, and primarily C5/C6.      Supraspinatus → suprascapular nerve, which comes off the superior trunk, which forms from C5/C6.      Deltoid → axillary nerve, off the radial nerve. Although the radial nerve has contributions from C5,6,7,8 and T1, the axillary nerve only has contributions from C5/C6.      Triceps → Radial nerve, primarily C7/C8.      Thenar Eminence → recurrent branch of median nerve.      Note that the muscles with 0 power are all innervated by the C5/6 nerve roots.        What could be causing his findings?          We have 3 possibilities:                  Triple nerve injury to the (1) musculocutaneous nerve, (2) axillary nerve, and (3) suprascapular nerve.          Nerve root avulsion at C5,6.          Neurotmesis of the superior trunk.                    By Occam’s razor, it’s more likely to be a single injury than 3 injuries, so 2 or 3 are most likely.      To distinguish between 2 or 3, you could assess the function of the dorsal scapular nerve, or the long thoracic nerve, since these come off of the roots.                  Recall that the dorsal scapular nerve innervates the levator scapulae, and the rhomboid major and minor.          Recall that the long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior.                    If it was a trunk injury, the action of these two nerves would be preserved; if it was a root avulsion, it wouldn’t be.        Objective      How can we tell if nerves are going to recover spontaneously?    As we saw in the previous lecture, peripheral nerve injuries can be classified as:          Neurapraxia (Class I) → myelin damage (ie. bruised nerve).      Axonotmesis (Class II) → axon damage.      Neurotmesis (Class III) → nerve is completely transected.        This was referred to as the Seddon classification system.  In addition to this, there is a newer, Sunderland classification, that more precisely stratifies nerve injuries, as shown below.  Classification of Peripheral Nerve Injuries                    Seddon Classification        Sunderland Classification        Injury                            First Degree        Neurapraxia        Myelin injured; intact axons                    Second        Axonotmesis        Axons injured; intact stroma                    Third                 Endoneurium disrupted                    Fourth                 Epineurium disrupted                    Fifth        Neurotmesis        Nerve transection              Nerve recovery can be predicted by the type of injury:          Neurapraxia → complete recovery.      Axonotmesis → variable recovery.      Neurotmesis → no chance of recovery.        Clinically, neuropraxia by definition will recover within 3 months, but axonotmesis and neurotmesis may look very similar.          In fact, although an EMG may distinguish neuropraxia from the other two, it can’t distinguish between axonotmesis and neurotmesis.        So practically, if we’re not sure if it’s axonotmesis of neurotmesis, we follow the patient:          Serial examinations looking for evidence of recovery.      We base our expectations on the size of the injury, and the expected rate of recovery (1 mm/day)      If no recovery by 3-4 months, consider reconstruction.        Objective      If they are not recovering, when and how should we fix them?    As was mentioned above, if there’s a possibility of recovery (ie, it isn’t obvious that the nerve has been transected), we only consider surgery if there’s no recovery by 3-4 months.  Surgical options include:          Neurolysis (not very useful, not used)      Direct repair      Nerve grafting → began use in the 1980s.      Nerve transfers → began use in the 1990s.      Direct Repair  If possible, this is the best option.  However, this is only possible for the first 1-2 weeks (before Wallerian degeneration occurs), and only if the gap is very small.            Because the nerves are normally under a state of mild tension, when they’re cut, the nerves actually retract.      This makes it difficult to directly reattach the nerves unless the distance is very small.      Attempting to repair nerves at longer distances using more tension will produce poor results.      Nerve Grafting  Also known as nerve splicing.  The idea here is to excise the damaged section of nerve, and to cut out a piece of another nerve to repair the gap.          We cut out nerves that are considered to be expendable; often this is the sural nerve that provides sensory innervation to the lateral leg and foot.        However, since the axons of the graft undergo Wallerian degeneration once its excised, it only functions as a scaffold through which the damaged nerve can grow through.          Since the axons in the graft itself die out, the nerve must still grow through the scaffold until it reaches the target, which can be slow (recall, 1 mm/day).        Why not use something else for a scaffold, instead of taking another nerve?          We’ve attempted to use veins, or man-made scaffolds, but there’s some factor in the connective tissue of the nerve itself that facilitates regrowth.      Hence, at the moment, we have to use a graft.        What factors limit the success of nerve grafting?          Age (&gt;30 years).      Length of gap (&gt;6 cm).      Distance from injury to motor endplate.      Mismatch of motor and sensory fascicles.        Since the nerve still has to grow through the graft, if it has to go a long way, the success is lower.          This is why the length of the gap, and the distance from the injury to the endplate matters.        Furthermore, if a motor fascicle is connected to a sensory fascicle, it won’t work.          To resolve this issue, we can actually use electrophysiological testing or histochemical staining to identify each fascicle before we reattach them.      However, this is only feasible if the number of fascicles is small. If it was an upper brachial plexus injury, this would be unrealistic.      Nerve Transfers  This is a very new technique, that was introduced only 20 years ago (1994).          It’s only been used routinely in the last decade.      Results in remarkably better recovery over a nerve graft.      This was what was used in the Case of the Week patient.        The way a nerve transfer works is to reconnect the damaged nerve to another ‘spare’ nerve that’s closer to the end muscle.          For instance, if we used a nerve graft for an ulnar nerve injury at the level of the axilla, it would take years for the nerve to grow through the graft and reach the hand. By that point, the muscles would have atrophied anyway.      But if we instead connected a nerve that was nearby the damaged distal nerve, the amount of time needed for regrowth would be much shorter.        Example:          A patient has an upper ulnar nerve injury at the level of the axilla.      Since the motor endplate is too far away, a nerve graft is infeasible.      Instead, we can redirect the nerve to the pronator quadratus (the anterior interosseous nerve), and use it to reconnect the distal ulnar nerve.      Since the pronator teres also pronates the hand, the pronator quadratus is somewhat redundant.      Now, since the distance to the end-plate is much shorter, the recovery time will be shorter (months vs years), and muscle atrophy will be reduced.        Problems with nerve transfers:          Since you’re attaching a different nerve, it takes a long time to relearn how to do certain actions.      In the above example, since you’re using the nerve to the pronator quadratus, the patient will have to pronate their wrist in order to adduct or abduct their fingers.        Benefits of Nerve Transfers:          Greatly decreases the time for new axons to reach the muscle.      You can be certain that you’re connecting fascicles ‘motor-to-motor’.

	{"title": "Nerve Injuries", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Differentiate the types of pathophysiology in a nerve injury and how that affects outcome.  Recognize the clinical features of common neuropathies.  Apply this to clinical anatomy.Lecture Overview  Nerve Anatomy and Pathophysiology.  Nerve Injury (3 examples):          Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.      Foot drop.      Radial Nerve Palsy.      Nerve Anatomy and Pathophysiology  The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is classified the somatic and autonomic nervous system.          Somatic Nervous System → motor fibres to skeletal muscle, sensory fibres from skin, viscera, muscles, and tendon receptors.      Autonomic Nervous System → generally travel with nerves or vessels and control sweating, blood flow, and end organ regulation.        As mentioned before, the cell body of the nerve root (eg. the dorsal root ganglion) lies distal to where the nerve attaches to the spinal cord.          As a result, if the nerve gets avulsed at the root, the cell body is still alive, but it’s not connected to the spinal cord.        Motor Unit → the key functional unit of muscle motion; comprises of:          Anterior horn cell.      Motor Nerve      Neuromuscular Junction and the end muscle      The Spinal Cord  Protruding from the spinal cord are both dorsal and ventral roots.  These then combine to form a spinal nerve, which then splits again to form dorsal and ventral rami.  The sympathetic trunk communicates with the spinal nerves via rami communicantes.Anatomy of a Nerve  A nerve is comprised of a bundle of fascicles.  Surrounding each nerve is a lining called the perineurium.  Surrounding each fascicle is a lining called an epineurium.  In each fascicle are a series of neuron axons.          These can be either motor or sensory, and myelinated or unmyelinated.      Recall that myelinated axons allow for faster conduction, because the signal can jump from one node of Ranvier to another.        When nerve reconstruction is done, it doesn’t just involve reconnecting the nerve itself, but actually involves connecting each fascicle (each of which is about the size of a hair).          Because each nerve has multiple fascicles, a partial nerve injury that doesn’t damage all the fascicles will still allow for some retained function.        Some classes of nerve fibres include:          A-alpha fibres → motor, myelinated, very fast      A-delta fibres → sensory, unmyelinated, slower.      C fibres → pain/temperature sensors, slow.      Classification of Nerve Disorders  Radiculopathies → nerve disorders affecting the roots.  Plexopathies → nerve disorders affecting the plexuses.  Mononeuropathies → lesions of individual peripheral nerves (usually compressive/traumatic).  Multiple mononeuropathies (mononeuropathy multiplex) → multiple focal lesions of individual peripheral nerves (usually inflammatory/vascular).  Polyneuropathies → generalized processes affecting the peripheral neuron cell body, the axon, and/or myelin.  How are multiple mononeuropathies different from polyneuropathies?          Multiple mononeuropathy typically affects only a few nerves, often in different areas of the body.      In contrast, polyneuropathy affects many nerves, usually in about the same areas on both sides of the body (hence, it’s a generalized process).      Extensive multiple mononeuropathy may be difficult to distinguish from polyneuropathy.      Nerve Injury  Wallerian Degeneration → this refers to a degenerative process that occurs after a nerve has been crushed or cut.          What happens is that any part of the nerve fibre that is separated from the neuron’s cell body due to the injury ends up degenerating.      Nerve regeneration does occur, where the axons that remain connected to the cell body can regrow. However, this is a slow process:                  Peripheral nerves regrow at a rate of 1 mm per day, or 1 inch a month.                      How does a nerve respond to being injured?          A transient insult (such as ischemia from sleeping on your arm) is quickly reversible.      A more significant insult (nerve stretch or transection) can result in Wallerian Degeneration.                  Insult      Terminology      Etiology      Examples                  Minimal      Reversible Conduction Block (CB)      Ischemia, mild compression      Crossed legs, slept on it              Intermediate      Prolonged CB      Focal demyelination      CTS              Severe      Wallerian (Axonal) Degeneration      Loss of axon and myelin sheath      Stretch, transection, prolonged ischemia (eg. with an infarction)        Remember      Nerves grow at approximately 1 mm/day or 1 inch/month.  Classification of Nerve Injury  Peripheral nerve injuries follow Seddon Classification, as follows:          Neurapraxia (Class I) → myelin damage (ie. bruised nerve).      Axonotmesis (Class II) → axon damage.      Neurotmesis (Class III) → nerve is completely transected.        These classifications are important because they guide treatment and prognosis.          For instance, neurotmesis will never recover naturally; you have to sew the two pieces back together.      Neurapraxia → complete recovery.      Axonotmesis → variable recovery.      Neurotmesis → no chance of recovery.        Peripheral Nerve Injury Classification      Neurapraxia (Class I) → myelin damage (ie. bruised nerve).    Axonotmesis (Class II) → axon damage.    Neurotmesis (Class III) → transected nerve.  Assessing Nerve Function  Nerve function is assessed with EMG/NCS:          EMG → Electromyography.                  This measures the electrical activity of the muscles, both at rest and when contracting.          Involves sticking a needle into the muscle.                    NCS → Nerve Conduction Studies.                  This measures the electrical activity of the nerve, such as how well and how fast it can send signals.                      EMG/NCS let you assess:          SNAP → Sensory Nerve Action Potential, which reflects sensory function.      MUAP → Motor Unit Action Potential, which reflects motor unit function.        EMG/NCS helps you identify the severity and extent of any neuromuscular problem.          One example of what you can see with EMG is shown below.      Here, note the spontaneous muscle activity seen with needle insertion into the muscle. This is bad; it suggests denervation, which brings the muscle membrane potential closer to zero.      The nerve typically provides inhibition to the motor unit, so without this, you see muscle fibrillations and positive sharp waves.        Remember      Muscle fibrillation and positive sharp waves are suggestive of muscle denervation.  Nerve Injury1. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome → neuropathy caused by the compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel.  What are the contents of the Carpal Tunnel?            10 things; 1 median nerve, 9 tendons.      Of the 9 tendons, 4 are the flexor digitorum superficialis tendons, 4 are the flexor digitorum profundus tendons, and 1 is the flexor pollicis longus.  Recall that MCP = Metacarpophalygeal joint, PIP = Proximal Interphalyngeal joint, DIP = Distal Interphalyngeal Joint.      Recall that the FDS flexes the MCP and PIP joints, while the FDP does the DIP joints (the superficial tendons split to let the deep tendons attach further along the fingers).        Special Tests for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome:          Tinel’s Sign → tapping on the carpal tunnel.                  Poor sensitivity and specificity; positive in 45% of people with CTS, but also 29% of normal people.                      Phalen’s Sign → wrist flexion as shown to the right. A positive sign will result in paresthesia in the distribution of the median nerve (medial palmar side of hand).                  Somewhat better sensitivity (40-60%).                      Other Signs of CTS:          Weakness with thumb abduction, opposition, and flexion.  L = Lumbricals 1/2, O = Opponens Pollicis, A = Abductor Pollicis Brevis, F = Flexor Pollicis Brevis.                  Recall that the recurrent branch of the median nerve innervates the LOAF muscles; (Lumbricals 1/2), Opposition, Abduction, and Flexion.          Hence, if the median nerve is compressed, the LOAF muscles will have reduced function.                    If there’s complete denervation, there may also be atrophy of the thenar eminence (thenar wasting).        Causes of CTS:          Most are idiopathic.      Some are anatomical (reduced space in the carpal tunnel), or due to diseases that cause nerve damage (diabetes, polyneuropathies).      One mnemonic for CTS causes is PRAGMATIC:                  P → Pregnancy (fluid retention is compressive)          R → Rheumatoid Arthritis (and other forms).          A → Acromegaly.          G → Glucose (Diabetes)          M → Mechanical.          A → Amyloid.          T → Thyroid (under-activity).          I → Infection.          C → Crystals (Gout, pseudogout).                      Treatment of CTS:          Non-surgical:                  Avoid activity, vibratory tools, and high force (duh).          Splinting.          Steroid injection into the carpal tunnel.          NSAIDs                    Surgery:                  Surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel → common, very effective.          Can be open or endoscopic.                    2. Foot Drop  Foot Drop → inability to dorsiflex the foot.  What is the nerve that’s damaged if there’s a foot drop?          The peroneal nerve (aka. the common fibular nerve).      This is the nerve that runs near the fibular neck, and is hence often damaged with a fibular fracture.      The sensory distribution of the peroneal nerve is the dorsum of the foot.        Why does a peroneal nerve injury cause a foot drop?          As the sciatic nerve goes from the thigh to the leg, it branches into a tibial and common fibular (peroneal) nerve.      The peroneal nerve then goes in front of the tibia and fibula, and the tibial nerve goes behind the tibia and fibula. The two branches are thus separated by the membrane separating the two bones (the interosseous membrane).      As a result, the tibial nerve innervates the posterior compartment muscles of the leg, while the common peroneal nerve innervates the anterior compartment (as well as the lateral compartment).      Since the anterior compartment is responsible for dorsiflexion, while the posterior compartment is responsible for plantar flexion, damage to the peroneal nerve will result in unapposed plantar flexion → a foot drop.        When should surgery be considered?          If the nerve is intact, but isn’t functioning, it’s best to wait a few months before considering surgery to see if it’ll recover on its own.      Surgery is indicated if there’s no recovery by 3 months.        What’s the treatment for Foot Drop?          AFO → Ankle Foot Orthosis. This is a splint that helps lift the foot up.      Surgery → some form of nerve repair, if due to a peroneal nerve problem.      3. Radial Nerve Palsy  Radial Nerve Palsy → injury to the radial nerve.  What are expected findings with a radial nerve palsy?          Numbness over the back of the hand.      Inability to extend the wrist or digits (the radial nerve, namely the posterior interosseous branch of the radial nerve, innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm).      Possible wrist drop due to unopposed flexion of the wrist.        What are common causes of radial nerve palsy?          Typically due to entrapment of the radial nerve as it’s in a very vulnerable position.      Recall that the radial nerve runs along the ‘radial groove’ of the humerus, which lies between the medial and lateral heads of the triceps.  Saturday Night Palsy is named as such because it reflects a common cause of compression; putting your arm over the armrest of an adjacent chair, such as when you’re making a move on a girl at the movie theatre.      Hence, anything that damages this area can cause a radial nerve palsy.                  Fracture of the Humerus          Saturday Night Palsy → ie. compression of the radial nerve.                      Path of the Radial Nerve (with Muscle Acronyms):          BR → Brachioradialis.      ECRL → Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus..      ECRB → Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis.      Supin → Supinator.      EDC → Extensor Digitorum (Communis).      ECU → Extensor Carpi Ulnaris.      APL → Abductor Pollicis Longus.      EPL → Extensor Pollicis Longus.      EPB → Extensor Pollicis Brevis.      EIP → Extensor Indicis (Proprius).      Summary  Nerve injury can be classified into 3 main categories:          Neurapraxia → myelin damage.      Axonotmesis → axon damage.      Neurotmesis → nerve transection.        Knowing these categories helps you determine prognosis and outcome:          For instance, neurotmesis will not improve unless surgery is done.        Imaging is used to assess anatomy.  EMG/NCS is used to assess physiology/function.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/26/nerve-injuries.html"},
	{"title": "Case of the Week &ndash; Brachial Plexus Injury", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Outline the anatomy of the brachial plexus          See The Brachial Plexus.        Discuss and Highlight clinical features of nerve root avulsion          Nerve root avulsion → pulling of the nerve roots out from the spinal cord.        Introduce the concepts of neuropathic pain and the Rehabilitation in Nerve injury.Nerve Root Avulsion  What clinical features make you think of nerve root avulsion?          Horner’s Syndrome (T1).      Severe Pain.      Dermatomal/myotomal weakness of C8/T1 segments.      Horner’s SyndromeRecall from ITM that the sympathetic trunk interacts with the spinal nerves or their ventral rami by way of rami communicantes.  The sympathetic trunk runs from T1-L2, so when there’s a brachial plexus injury, Horner’s syndrome is a sign that the T1 nerve root has been avulsed.            Horner’s Syndrome is characterized by decreased pupil dilation, eyelid retraction, and sweating on the side of the nerve root lesion.                  Can be caused by damage at any point along the sympathetic pathway.                    This makes sense; if the sympathetic trunk is damaged on one side, you’ll have unopposed parasympathetic activity. This results in the clinical findings described.      The other side will have a normal sympathetic trunk, so that side will have exhibit sympathetic activity in a person that just experienced an injury.      Dermatomal Weakness  Good ways to assess each dermatome are:          Thumb = C6 (median &amp; radial nerve innervation).      Middle finger = C7 (median &amp; ulnar nerve innervation).      Little finger = C8 (ulnar nerve innervation).        Although the thumb and middle finger have multiple nerves innervating them, they each mainly have 1 involved root.  Finger Dermatomal Associations                             Dermatome        Nerves                            Thumb        C6        Radial + median                    Middle Finger        C7        Median + ulnar                    Little Finger        C8        Ulnear            Patient Case  Case Summary      33 year old male, MCA (motorcycle accident) May 2013.    Left clavicle fracture, right arm weakness.    Problems:              Left shoulder weakness.        Severe right arm pain.        Right hand and forearm weakness/clumsiness.              P/E Findings              Left Hand                      Abnormal Clavicle at SC joint.            Weakness of Deltoid (shoulder Abduction) and Shoulder ER (infraspinatus)            Triceps 4/5.            Good Elbow Flexion (biceps/brachialis).                          Right Hand  Hyperalgesia → increased sensitivity to pain.                      Horners → miosis, hypohydrosis, ptosis, enopthalmous,            4th 5th finger allodynia, hyperalgesia.            Absent sensation in medial arm and medial hand C7/C8/T1 dermatome.            Good shoulder, Elbow function.            Weak ie. no hand intrinsic function, or thumb Abduction, 0/5 thumb extension.                              Left Sided Injuries  What caused his deltoid weakness?          Damage to the axillary nerve, which innervates deltoid and teres minor.        Where is the corresponding sensory region?          The deltoid is innervated mainly by the C5 nerve root. (C5)      The corresponding dermatomal region is the lateral upper side of arm (since it’s where a military badge would be placed, it’s sometimes called the Sergeant’s patch).      Right Shoulder Injuries  What nerve root are you worried about with his Horner’s Syndrome?          T1 → where the sympathetic trunk overlaps with the brachial plexus.        What muscle(s) are affected if he can’t abduct his thumb?          Abductor pollicis longus (extrinsic).      Abductor pollicis brevis (intrinsic).        What muscle(s) are affected if he can’t extend his thumb?          Extensor pollicis longus (extrinsic).      Extensor pollicis brevis (extrinsic).        An MRI revealed a pseudomeningocele, as shown to the right (axial MRI at the T1 level):          Pseudomeningocele → it looks like an meningocele, but it’s not contained within the dura, but rather by the surrounding soft tissues.      In other words, the dura has actually been damaged, and the CSF is leaking out. Note the outpouching of CSF seen to the right.      This is often seen with a nerve root avulsion; when the nerve root gets pulled out, the CSF ends up oozing out.      Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)  NCS Findings      NCS revealed the following:    Right Sided:  APB = Abductor Pollicis Brevis, ADQ = abductor digiti quinti, ie. abductor digiti minimi.              Severe axonal loss to the hand muscles, thumb abductors, and thumb extensors (ie. no motor units).        Absent median and ulnar function (median assessed by APB, ulnar assessed by ADQ)        Median antebrachial cutaneous nerve conduction present SNAP, but no sensation. (SNAP = Sensory Neuron Action Potential)              Left Sided:              Left Deltoid Denervation with no deltoid MUAPs (MUAP = Motor Unit Action Potential).              How is it possible that nerve conduction tests showed present SNAPs, but the patient was asensate?          In other words, nerve conduction was normal, but the patient still had no sensation.      This fact that conduction was normal suggests that the dorsal root ganglion (where the cell body lives) and everything distal to that is okay.      However, the fact that the patient is still asensate suggests that there’s nothing that attaches the cell body to the spinal cord.      In otherwords, this is a sign that there’s a nerve avulsion.        Remember      Nerve Conduction Studies showing present SNAPs but no corresponding sensation suggests a nerve root avulsion.  Treatment  In summary, this patient had:          Severe Right Brachial Plexopathy with Nerve Root Avulsion.      Left Axillary Nerve Palsy.      Left Clavicle Fracture.        As a result, he has lost the ability to effectively (1) abduct his left arm (L deltoid), and (2) use his right hand (due to lower nerve root contributions to the median/ulnar nerve).          The radial nerve (C5,6,7) and the musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7) have preserved function, because the avulsion was at the level of T1.      Hence, the action of his right upper arm is largely intact.        What can you do to treat this patient?          Nerve repair surgery.      In general, these types of repairs must be done shortly after the injury (within a year), otherwise the muscle will atrophy and the outcomes of nerve repair will be poor.      Because you need to reattach the disconnected nerve to something, repair will involve rerouting a functional nerve.        Improving his L Arm Abduction           This was done with a left axillary nerve repair.      Involves redirecting a branch of the functioning left radial nerve to reconnect the axillary nerve.      In this case, a branch of the radial nerve that attached to one of the heads of the tricep was used.                  As a result, the patient then ends up with 2/3 heads of his left triceps innervated; his triceps will still work, but it’ll be weaker.                    Because his deltoid is now innervated by a branch of radial nerve involved in arm extension, whenever he now wants to abduct his arm, he has to think of extending his arm!                  However, eventually, the brain figures out that it doesn’t have to do this, and relearns how to naturally abduct the arm (neuroplasticity).                      Improving the use of his R Hand          Unfortunately, it’s impossible to reconnect an avulsed nerve root.                  The nerve root is like a coaxial cable; it contains thousands of cell bodies that are impossible to reconnect individually.                    Hence, there’s no way to directly re-innervate the hand.      Instead, just as before, we can redirect other functional nerves.                  Redirect the branch of the right MCN to brachialis (musculocutaneous nerve) to AIN (anterior interosseous nerve).          Redirect the branch of the right radial to supinator to PIN (posterior interosseous).                    Why is it okay to lose innervation to these muscles?                  The biceps brachii can still do the functions of the brachialis and supinator by itself          Recall that the brachialis crosses the elbow joint and is involved in elbow flexion, while the supinator is involved in supination.          Hence, although flexion and supination will be weaker, the biceps will still be able to cover the slack from losing the action of the other 2.                    Why is it important to gain innervation to the AIN and PIN?                  These two muscles innervate the deep anterior muscles and posterior muscles of the forearm, so reconnecting them will help restore some of his ‘pinching’ capacity.          By being able to use his right arm to pinch to a certain degree, his functional capacity improves tremendously.                          He can grasp objects, button things up, etc.                                          Neuropathic Pain  Neuropathic pain is pain arising from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease or injury of the nervous system.          It remains persistent without ongoing disease.        What are the symptoms of neuropathic pain?          Shooting pain, burning pain, tingling and numbness.      Dyesthesia → abnormal (often painful) sensation.      Hyperalgesia → increased pain response to a painful stimulus.      Allodynia → increased pain response to a non-painful stimulus.        What are features of neuropathic pain?          Often experienced in parts of the body that otherwise appear normal.      Generally chronic, severe and resistant to over-the-counter analgesics.      It is further aggravated by allodynia (touch-evoked pain), and hyperalgesia (increased pain to a painful stimulus).        How is neuropathic pain treated?          Oftentimes it’s highly persistent and difficult to treat.      Narcotics are a poor choice for neuropathic pain → they don’t really help, but make you feel drowsy and out-of-it, and also cause unpleasant GI side-effects (constipation).       Depression medications are more effective.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/26/case-week-brachial-plexus.html"},
	{"title": "Approach to the Arm and Elbow", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Apply anatomy to distinguish the common areas of elbow pathology:          Joint arthropathy (arthritis)      Joint stability (Fracture, Dislocation)      Other structures: eg. Bursa, Capsule, Ligament, Tendon, nerve.        Some useful acronyms:          FOOSH → Falling on an outstretched hand (common MSK mnemonic).      ORIF = Open Reduction, Internal Fixation.      Arthritis  In general, arthritis can be categorized as either inflammatory or non-inflammatory:          Non-Inflammatory Arthritis                  Post traumatic.          Osteoarthritis.                    Inflammatory Arthritis                  Rheumatoid.          Psoriatic.          Crystalline (Gout, CPPD).                      The inflammatory causes will be discussed during the rheumatology week.  Today we’ll be focusing primarily on osteoarthritis of the elbow joint.Elbow Osteoarthritis  Progressive pain, stiffness, and loss of RoM of the elbow joint.  This is due to progressive cartilage loss.          It’s unusual to see the elbow as the first presenting joint with degenerative conditions, unless there’s a history trauma.      Typically, the weight-bearing joints are the first to go → the knees and hips.        Clinical Features:          Deep aching quality of elbow (vs superficial).      Loss of both passive and active ROM.      Exacerbated by activity; relieved with rest.      Here, note (1) the loss of joint space, and (2) sclerosis (increased density) of the surrounding bone.  If a person presented with medial elbow pain, stiffness and a loss of ROM of the elbow, and also began to complain of numbness in the 4th and 5th finger, what structure would you think of?          Ulnar nerve.      The ulnar nerve runs along the medial epicondyle of the humerus.        What are treatment options for osteoarthritis?          Activity modification.      NSAIDS, analgesics.      PT.      Surgery → debridement, replacement.        What is joint debridement?          Debridement is when you go into the joint and ‘clean out the joint space’.      Not curative; it doesn’t magically restore cartilage. It simply aims to eliminate any damaged tissue that’s causing the elbow to ‘catch’.      Hence this reduces pain and improves function.      Reserved for younger patients → a replacement only lasts around 10 years, so it wouldn’t be a good first line choice in a younger patient.        What is joint replacement?          Where you replace components of the joint.      For the elbow, this procedure is called Total Elbow Arthroplasty.      Very good results with inflammatory conditions where the cause is not wear and tear.      Poor results with osteoarthritis or post-traumatic arthritis → the replacement joint easily wears down, so here the joint will have poor survival.        Remember      Total elbow arthroplasty is used for inflammatory conditions, but not for osteoarthritis.  Tendon Problems  Tendonitis → tendon inflammation.  Tendonosis → tendon degeneration.  Tendonitis and tendonosis are often used synonymously, but technically, the majority of issues are due to degeneration as opposed to inflammation.  With respect to the elbow, we’ll mainly be dealing with the most common tendon issue; inflammation of the tendons attaching to the lateral epicondyle.  Pathological tendon findings are categorized by whether there’s pain with active or passive movement:          Tendonitis → pain on resistive activity (eg. lateral epicondylitis).      Tenosynovitis → pain with passive movement (eg. De Quervain’s Tenosynovitis).      Lateral Epicondylitis  aka. Tennis Elbow  ‘Insertionitis’ of the extensor origin group (recall that all the wrist extensors attach to the lateral epicondyle).  Known as ‘tennis elbow’ because you need strong wrist extensors to hit a steady backhand in tennis.   Hence people playing tennis put more stress on the muscles inserting into the lateral epicondyle.  Clinical Features          Latearl epicondylar region is warm, occasionally swollen      Tender to palpation.      Pain on resisted activity of attachment group.                  Recall that this included wrist extension, finger extension, and forearm supination.  EPL = extensor pollicis longus, EPB = extensor pollicis brevis, APL = abductor pollicis longus.          This does not include thumb extension (EPL, EPB, APL do not attach at the elbow, but further down the radius and ulna).                      Treatment of Epicondylitis:          Modified activities.      PT.      NSAIDS, Analgesics.      Local steroid injection (cortisone)      Surgery.      Tenosynovitis  De Quervain’s Tenosynovitis → inflammation of the fluid filled sheath that surrounds the tendons of the first extensor compartment.          Because this affects the smooth movement of the tendon, pain will be present with passive movement.        The first extensor compartment (most medial) contains 2 tendons:          APL → Abductor Pollicis Longus.      EPB → Extensor Pollicis Brevis.      EPL is not part of the first compartment; recall that it wraps around Lister’s tubercle to form the other side of the snuff box. Hence, it’s more lateral than APL and EPB.        Treatment of Tenosynovitis:          Cortisone injections (know complications and contraindications).      Ligament Problems  Ligament is more irregularly arranged and contains more elastin fibres than tendons.  Ligaments provide strong tensile force to help maintain joint stability.  With respect to the elbow joint, it’s effectively a hinge; unlike the shoulder, it’s fairly stable with good osseous support.Little Leaguer’s Elbow  Little Leaguer’s Elbow → elbow injury commonly seen in the skeletally immature.          Due to the fact that the medial epicondylar growth plate is weaker, and is therefore more susceptible to trauma when pulled by the MCL.      Since the MCL attaches to the medial epicondyle, a strong MCL pull can result in an avulsion fracture of the medial epicondyle.      Avulsion fracture → fracture of the piece of bone attached to a ligament or tendon.        Typically seen when the growth plate is vulnerable, between 11-13.          This is when the growth plate is beginning to close.      That’s also why you’re not allowed to throw curve balls when you’re a kid; it puts too much pressure on the medial epicondyle.        Treatment Options for Little Leaguer’s Elbow:          Rest, modified activity at least 6-8 weeks/year.      PT.      Surgery if epicondyle is displaced more than 1 cm.      Consider ulnar neuropathy or joint instability.      Nerve Problems  Cubital Tunnel Syndrome → ulnar nerve trapping/pinching in the cubital tunnel.          The cubital tunnel lies between the two heads of the FCU (flexor carpi ulnaris); between the olecranon and medial epicondyle.        Findings with Cubital Tunnel Syndrome:          Sensory Exam → decreased sensation in ulnar nerve distribution (4th and 5th fingers).      Motor Exam:                  Weakness with grasping, pinching, and dexterity.          Recall the DAB/PAD mnemonic → as we’ll see later, the dorsal interossei of the hand abduct the fingers (hence DAB), and the plantar interossei of the hand adduct the fingers (hence PAD).          With more severe injury, an ulnar claw might also be seen.                    Other features:                  Positive Tinel’s sign at the ulnar nerve at the elbow (ie. right below the medial epicondyle).                      Causes of Cubital Tunnel Syndrome          Increased external pressure → anesthesia, bed mobility, wheelchair, trauma.      Pathology in the groove itself → fracture, stretch, osteophytes with osteoarthritis.      Practice Quiz  A 29 year old school teacher complains of sharp lateral elbow pain for the past 4 days. He recalls chipping ice from the front steps this weekend. The pain is brought out by activities involving gripping and lifting especially with a fist and wrist extended.           What’s the diagnosis?        A 24 year old woman complains of medial right elbow pain, sometimes extending down the forearm and is accompanied by tingling/numbness in the 4th and 5th fingers. This is particularly true when she is playing volleyball.          What’s the diagnosis?        A 31 year old man slipped on the sidewalk, striking his elbow. Now he has pain and swelling of the elbow and is unable to bend or move the elbow.          What diagnostic test would you like to order?        An X-Ray was taken for this patient, and the following was seen:          Given this X-Ray, what’s the most likely diagnosis?      Answers  Lateral epicondylitis.  Ulnar neuropathy.  X-ray.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Forearm", "text": "Introduction  Arm → shoulder to elbow.  Forearm → elbow to wrist.  The forearm is split into 2 compartments, just like the arm.          Anterior Compartment → involved in flexion of the wrist, and (some) pronation.                  Almost all of the muscles of the anterior compartment are innervated by the median nerve (C5,6,7,8 T1)                    Posterior Compartment → involved in extension of the wrist, and supination.                  Innervated by the radial nerve (C5,6,7,8 T1).                      The ulna is always medial to the radius, in terms of orientation.          When we pronate or supinate our arm, the ulna remains fixed, while the radius moves over top it.      A. Bones of the Forearm  Interosseous Membrane: separates the anterior and posterior compartments. Made of connective tissue, increasing the rigidity of ulna and radius together.  Head of Ulna/Radius  Styloid Process of Radius  Styloid Process of Ulna  Ulnar Notch  Distal Radioulnar Joint  Proximal Radioulnar Joint  Clinical Note: The styloid process of radius is more distal than that of ulna. However, if there’s a fracture of either the radius or the ulna, then the relative positions of the two styloid processes can shift.B. Elbow Joint  Radial Annular Ligament → the radial head pivots within the annular ligament axis during movements of pronation and supination  Medial (Ulnar) Collateral Ligament.  Lateral (Radial) Collateral Ligament.  Tendon Bicep Brachii.  Olecranon Bursa → The olecranon bursa lies between the olecranon and the skin; inflammation of this is colloquially known as Student’s elbow (students spend lots of time resting on their elbows).C. Anterior Muscles of the Forearm  Innervation → median nerve (with a few exceptions).  Function → flexion and pronation.  Blood Supply → the radial and ulnar arteries.          Recall that the brachial artery branches into a radial and ulnar branch at the level of the forearm.        Broadly speaking, the anterior muscles of the forearm are classified into:          Superficial layer.      Middle layer.      Deep layer.      Superficial Muscles  4 main muscles comprise the superficial layer of anterior muscles:          Pronator teres      Flexor carpi radialis      Flexor carpi ulnaris      Palmaris longus.        Pronator teres is a wrist pronator; the rest are wrist flexors.  All are innervated by the median nerve except the flexor carpi ulnaris, which is innervated by the ulnar nerve.  The superficial muscles share a common attachment; the medial epicondyle. This is known as the common flexor origin (CFO).  The bicipital aponeurosis covers the heads of these superficial muscles.1. Pronator Teres  O → medial EPICONDYLE of humerus and CORONOID process of ulna   I → middle lateral surface of RADIUS   A → PRONATES and FLEXES forearm at elbow   N → MEDIAN NERVE (C7,8)  Notes:          This is the only anterior superficial muscle that is not a wrist flexor (doesn’t cross the wrist).      Since it attaches on the medial side of the humerus, and then crosses laterally to the radius, when it contracts, it pronates the arm.      2. Flexor Carpi Radialis  O → medial EPICONDYLE of humerus   I → base of 2nd METACARPAL   A → FLEXES and ABDUCTS the hand at wrist   N → MEDIAN NERVE (C7,8)  Notes:          From the name (flexor carpi radialis), it flexes the wrist from the radial side.      Since it attaches to the side of the hand, it doesn’t result in true flexion, but rather radial deviation (ie. abduction).      3. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris  O: Differs depending on the head:          Humeral Head: medial EPICONDYLE      Ulnar Head: OLECRANON and post. ULNA         I → PISIFORM, HAMATE and 5th METACARPAL   A → FLEXES and ADDUCTS hand at wrist   N → ULNAR NERVE (C8).  Notes:          This is analogous to the flexor carpi radialis, except that it attaches to the other side of the hand.      Hence, it results in ulnar deviation (adduction).      Note that this was an exception to the rule that all anterior muscles are innervated by the medial nerve; it’s innervated by the ulnar nerve (this makes sense; it has ulnaris in it’s name).      4. Palmaris Longus  O → medial EPICONDYLE   I → distal FLEXOR RETINACULUM and PALMAR APONEUROSIS   A → weak FLEXOR and TIGHTENS PALMAR aponeurosis   N → MEDIAN NERVE(C7,8)  Notes:          Not everyone has a palmaris longus; it’s thought that primates had a more pronounced palmaris longus, so the more distantly related you are, the less likely you are to have one.      It has a small belly and a long tendon, which then attaches to the palmar aponeurosis.      Flexor Retinaculum: the band of connective tissue at wrist which prevents bow stringing of tendons of the wrist      Palmar Aponeurosis: sheet of connective tissue over the palm of hand that helps provide structural support      Middle Muscle1. Flexor Digitorum Superficialis  This is the only muscle of the middle layer.  O → Depends on the head:          Humeroulnar Head: medial EPICONDYLE of humerus (CFO), CORONOID process of ulna, ulnar COLLATERAL LIGAMENT       Radial Head: superior anterior RADIUS.        I → MIDDLE PHALANGES (2-5)   A → FLEXES MIDDLE PHALANGES at proximal interphalangeal joints (4 fingers).  N → MEDIAN NERVE (C7,8)  Notes:          Just like all of the other anterior muscles, this has an origin at the medial epicondyle.      The tendons of these muscles insert into the middle phalanges of the 4 fingers.      However, before they get there, they split (like a snake’s tongue).      The reason for this is that the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus (a deeper muscle) actually go further, into the distal phalanges.      As a result, the superficial tendons have to split in order to let the deep tendons get by.      Deep Muscles  3 main muscles comprise the deep layer of anterior muscles:          Flexor Digitorum Profundus      Flexor Pollicis Longus      Pronator Quadratus        Like most of the other anterior muscles, these are innervated by the median nerve. However, the deep muscles in particular are innervated by a particular branch of the median nerve, the anterior interosseous branch.  Unlike most of the other anterior muscles, these don’t originate at the medial epicondyle.1. Flexor Digitorum Profundus  O → proximal medial anterior ULNA and INTEROSSEUS membrane   I → distal phalanges 2-5 (deep is distant!!!)   A → FLEXES distal phalanges at distal interphalangeal joint (2-5)   N → this is the 2nd exception (in addition to the flexor carpi ulnaris) to the median nerve innervation rule; only part of it is innervated by a branch of the median:          Medial Part: ULNAR NERVE      Ulnar Part: anterior interosseous branch of MEDIAN NERVE        Notes → as mentioned previously, the tendons of the profundus muscle run past the tendons of the superficialis where they split.2. Flexor Pollicis Longus  O → anterior RADIUS and INTEROSSEUS membrane   I → DISTAL PHALANX of thumb   A → FLEXES THUMB   N → anterior interosseous branch of MEDIAN NERVE.  Notes: Pollicis = thumb.3. Pronator Quadratus  O → anterior ULNA.  I → anterior RADIUS.  A → PRONATES forearm.   N → anterior interosseous branch of MEDIAN NERVE  Notes: this is the second anterior muscle that isn’t a flexor; the pronator quadratus, along with the pronator teres, are the two pronators of the arm.Summary of Anterior Muscles of the Forearm                   Origin      Insertion      Action      Innervation            SUPERFICIAL LAYER          Pronator Teres      Medial epicondyle (CFO)      Lateral radius      Wrist pronation      Median nerve              Flexor Carpi Radialis      Medial epicondyle (CFO)      Lateral hand (base of 2nd metacarpal)      Flexion and radial deviation (abduction) of wrist      Median nerve              Flexor Carpi Ulnaris                          Humeral head: Medial epicondyle (CFO)          Short head: Olecranon                  Medial hand (pisiform, hamate, 5th metacarsal)      Flexion and ulnar deviation (adduction) of wrist      Ulnar nerve              Palmaris longus      Medial Epicondyle (CFO)      Palmar aponeurosus and flexor retinaculum      Weak flexor; tightens palmar aponeurosis      Median Nerve        MIDDLE LAYER          Flexor Digitorum Superficialis                        Humeroulnar Head: Medial epicondyle (CFO)          Radial Head: Superior anterior radius                    Middle phalanges      Flexion at the middle phalanges      Median Nerve        DEEP LAYER          Flexor Digitorum Profundus      Proximal medial anterior ulna and interosseous membrane       Distal phalanges      Flexion at the distal phalanges                        Medial part: Ulnar nerve          Ulnar part: Anterior interosseous nerve (branch of median)                            Flexor Pollicis Longus      Proximal medial anterior ulna and interosseous membrane       Distal phalynx of thumb      Flexion of the thumb      Anterior interosseous nerve (branch of median)              Pronator Quadratus      Anterior ulna      Anterior radius      Wrist pronation      Anterior interosseous nerve (branch of median)      D. Posterior Muscles of the Forearm  Innervation → ALL via the radial nerve.          More specifically, this is via a specific branch of the radial nerve: the posterior interosseous branch (with 1 exception).      Contrast this with the anterior interosseous branch off the median nerve, which innervates the deep muscles of the anterior compartment.        Function → extension and supination.  Blood Supply → the posterior interosseous artery          Recall that this was a branch of the common interosseous, which came off the ulnar artery.        Broadly speaking, the posterior muscles of the forearm are classified into:          Superficial layer.      Deep layer.        There’s no middle layer like with the anterior muscles!Superficial MusclesUsually, when you see a brevis and longus muscle, the longus one will actually be smaller than the brevis one. The longus and brevis refers to the length of the tendon, not the size of the muscle.  5 main muscles comprise the superficial layer of posterior muscles:          Extensor Carpi Ulnaris      Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus      Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis      Extensor Digitorum      Extensor Digiti Minimi.        The superficial muscles share a common attachment; the lateral epicondyle. This is known as the common extensor origin (CEO).          Irritation of the lateral epicondyle due to extensor action is colloquially known as Tennis Elbow.      1. Extensor Carpi Ulnaris  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus  I → base of 5th metacarpal  A → Extends and Adducts hand at wrist  N → Posterior Interosseous branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)  Notes: This is the extensor analag to the flexor carpi ulnaris in the anterior compartment.2. Extensor Digiti Minimi  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus  I → Proximal phalanx of 5th digit (pinky)  A → Extends wrist and 5th digit (pinky)  N → Posterior Interosseous branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)  Notes: as the name suggests, this extends the little finger (digiti minimi).3. Extensor Digitorum  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus  I → Extensor Expansion of medial 4 digits  A → Extends fingers at metacarpalphalangeal joints and Extends hand at wrist  N → Posterior Interosseous branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)  Notes:          Unlike the anterior compartment, where there was both a flexor digitorum superficialis and a flexor digitorum profundus, there’s only one muscle that controls digit extension.      The tendons of the extensor digitorum are interconnected; this makes it harder to independently extend the fingers (unlike with the flexor digitorum muscles).      4. Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus  I → Base of 3rd metacarpal  A → Extends and Abducts hand at wrist  N → Posterior Interosseous (Deep branch) of Radial Nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)  Notes: Note that there are 2 muscles that extend and adduct the wrist, and only 1 (flexor carpi radialis) that flex and adduct it.5. Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus  O → Lateral supracondyle ridge of humerus  I → Base of 2nd metacarpal  A → Extends and Abducts hand at wrist  N → Radial Nerve (C6)   Notes: This is an exception to the rule that all the posterior compartment muscles are innervated by the posterior interosseous branch of the radial.          Since it originates higher on the humerus, it actually gets innervation from the radial nerve itself before it gives off the posterior interosseous branch.      Deep Muscles  5 main muscles comprise the deep layer of the posterior muscles:          Supinator      Abductor Pollicis Longus      Extensor Pollicis Longus      Extensor Pollicis Brevis      Extensor Indicis        Since there are extra muscles attaching to the index finger and pinky (the extensor indicis and extensor digiti minimi respectively), they have more independent movement than the other fingers.  The thumb itself has a number of muscles attaching to it, so it can also easily move independently.  These muscles come out from under the superficial muscles, so they’re often referred to as the outcropping group.1. Supinator  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus, RADIAL COLLATERAL and ANNULAR LIGAMENTS, SUPINATOR FOSSA, and CREST OF ULNA  I → lateral, posterior, and anterior of proximal radius  A → Supinates forearm  N → Posterior Interosseous branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)   Notes → opposes the action of the pronators (pronator teres, pronator quadratus).2. Abductor Pollicis Longus*  O → posterior surface of ULNA, RADIUS, INTEROSSEOUS MEMBRANE  I → base of 1st metacarpal  A → Abducts thumb and extends carpo-metacarpal joints  N → Posterior Interosseous branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1) 3. Extensor Pollicis Longus*  O → posterior middle ULNA and INTEROSSEOUS MEMBRANE  I → base of DISTAL PHALANX of thumb  A → Extends thumb at carpometacarpal and interphalangeal joints  N → Posterior Interosseous branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1) 4. Extensor Pollicis Brevis*  O → posterior RADIUS and INTEROSSEOUS MEMBRANE  I → base of PROXIMAL PHALANX of thumb  A → Extends proximal phalanx at carpometacarpal joint  N → Posterior Interosseous branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1) 5. Extensor Indicis  O → posterior ULNA and INTEROSSEOUS MEMBRANE  I → Extensor expansion of 2nd Digit  A → Extends index finger and extends hand  N → Posterior Interosseous branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)   Notes → allows the index finger to have extension independent of the extensor digitorum (which is why you can point).*: These muscles comprise the anatomical snuffbox:  Extensor policus longus.

Ulnar nerve = flexor carpi ulnarus and half of flexor digitorum profundus.    Radial nerve = all posterior forearm muscles (most as the posterior interosseous nerve branch).  E. Anterior Compartment Arteries  Brachial artery branches into radial (lateral) and ulnar (medial)          Both supply the anterior compartment.        The 2 arteries form arches in the palm:          The ulnar artery forms the superficial palmar arch.      The radial artery forms the deep palmar arch.      The two anastamose with one another to provide dual circulation.        The common interosseous artery branches off the ulnar artery, and branches further into anterior interosseous artery and posterior interosseous artery.          The common interosseous aptly runs between the radius and ulna.      The anterior interosseous and posterior interosseous arteries run anterior and posterior to the interosseous membranes respectively.      This is important because the only blood supply to the posterior forearm is through this posterior interosseous artery.        Finally, radial and ulnar recurrents come back up the arm and anastamose with the ulnar collaterals we saw in the previous lecture.          As mentioned before, this helps maintain circulation to the elbow joint.      F. Components of the ForearmG. Carpal Tunnel  Guyon’s Canal → small canal that carries the ulnar artery and ulnar nerve.          Between palmar carpal ligament (superficial), flexor retinaculum and hypothenar muscles (deep), pisiform and pisohamate ligament (medial), and hook of hamate (lateral).        Carpal Tunnel → the carpal bones of the wrist are concave with respect to the palmar side, creating a space through which the carpal tunnel runs.          The superficial side is covered by the flexor retinaculum to create tunnel.      Contents of carpal tunnel (1 nerve, 9 tendons):                  Median Nerve          Flexor Pollicis Longus Tendon          Flexor Digitorum Profundus (4 tendons)          Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (4 tendons)                      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome → median nerve entrapment neuropathy that causes paresthesia, pain, numbness and other symptoms in the distribution of the median nerve due to compression of the carpal tunnelH. Colle’s Fracture  Colle’s Fracture → fracture of the distal radius (distal neck) with dorsal (posterior) and radial displacement of the wrist and hand  Is described as a bayonet or dinner fork configuration of the bones.  Often associated with osteoporosis.  It is due to a trauma which hyperextends the wrist.  Smith’s Fractures – similar to Colle’s fracture but it is due to a hyperflexion of the wrist.  Can result in damage to median nerve either via hematoma in the carpal tunnel, hyperextension at the time of trauma, or direct injury.  Scaphoid Fractures can also be associated with this.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/23/anatomy-forearm.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Arm", "text": "Introduction  Arm → shoulder to elbow.  Forearm → elbow to wrist.  The arm, like the forearm, is split into 2 compartments.          Anterior Compartment → involved in flexion of the shoulder and elbow, and supination.                  Innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7).                    Posterior Compartment → involved in extension of the shoulder and elbow.                  Innervated by the radial nerve (C5,6,7,8 T1).                      In the lateral arm runs the cephalic vein; in the medial arm runs the basilic vein.A. Bones of the Arm  Lateral Epicondyle  Medial Epicondyle  Olecranon Process of Ulna  Olecranon Fossa  Coronoid Fossa  Radial Fossa  Coronoid Process of Ulna  Capitulum Trochlea  Radial Tuberosity  Ulnar Tuberosity  Greater Tubercle  Lesser Tubercle  Head of humerus  Bicipital Groove  Deltoid TuberosityB. Anterior Arm Muscles  The 3 muscles of the anterior compartment comprise of:          Biceps Brachii (aka. biceps)      Brachialis      Coracobrachialis        All of them are supplied by the brachial artery.  All of them are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve.          Note that the musculocutaneous nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment, and then continues as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm and provides sensory innervation.      Since it innervates the muscles, and then the cutaneous forearm, it’s aptly referred to as the musculocutaneous nerve.        In addition to these 3 muscles, there’s another ‘pseudo’ anterior arm muscle called the brachioradialis muscle.          This muscle is located in the anterior compartment, but is innervated like a posterior compartment muscle (ie. by the radial nerve).      1. Biceps Brachii  O: Differs depending on the head:          Short Head: CORACOID process of scapula.      Long Head: SUPRAGLENOID tubercle of scapula/glenoid labrum.        I → RADIAL TUBEROSITY.   A → Supinates forearm (major) and flexes elbow   N → Musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7)  Clinical → the long tendon ruptures easily with trauma in the elderly; tapping the biceps tendon briskly elicits the biceps jerk tendon reflex to check C5/C6 spinal cord levels.  Blood Supply → Brachial artery and branches.  Notes:           In the arm, the median nerve is most medial, then the brachial artery, and then the biceps brachii is most lateral.      A sheet-like tendon near the base of the biceps called the bicipital aponeurosis protects the brachial artery and median nerve as they continue into the forearm.      2. Brachialis  O → Distal anterior humerus.  I → CORONOID process of ULNAR TUBEROSITY   A → MAJOR flexor of forearm (thumbs up), flexes forearm in all positions.  N → Musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7).  Notes:          Note that this attaches to the ulnar tuberosity as opposed to the radial tuberosity.      Hence, the biceps brachii attaches to the radial tuberosity, and the brachialis attaches to the ulnar tuberosity.      3. Coracobrachialis  O → CORACOID process of scapula   I → Medial HUMERUS   A → Weak flexor and adducts arm   N → Musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7)  Notes:          Small muscle; does not cross the elbow (starts from the coracoid, and only goes to the medial humerus). As a result, it only flexes the arm at the glenohumeral joint.      Good landmark for the musculocutaneous nerve, because you can see the nerve pierce the muscle!      4. Brachioradialis  O → Proximal lateral SUPRACONDYLAR ridge of humerus   I → lateral surface of distal RADIUS (styloid process).  A → FLEXES the forearm   N → Radial nerve (C5,6,7)  Clinical → tapping elicits the brachioradialis jerk tendon reflex used to test for C5, C6, and C7 spinal cord levels  Notes:          Not really an anterior arm muscle, since it’s innervated by the radial nerve, as opposed to the musculocutaneous nerve.      Forms the bulk of the lateral side of your forearm.      Good landmark to distinguish between the anterior and posterior compartments.      Since it crosses the elbow, it does elbow flexion.      It’s strongest when the radius is upwards (the muscle is least stretched), so it’s used most when in a ‘hammering’ or ‘drinking’ position.      Hence it’s known as the drinking or thumbs-up muscle.      5. Summary of Anterior Arm Muscles  The biceps brachii crosses both the shoulder and elbow so it can flex both.  The brachialis and brachioradialis only cross the elbow so they only flex the elbow.          Since the brachialis attaches to the ulnar tuberosity, and the brachioradialis attaches to the distal radius, they’re stronger in different positions.        The coracobrachialis only crosses the shoulder, so it only flexes the shoulder (and adducts it).                   Origin      Insertion      Action      Innervation                  Biceps Brachii            	      		Long head: supraglenoid tubercle      		Short head: coracoid process      	            Radial tuberosity      Shoulder and elbow flexion; supination      Musculocutaneous nerve              Brachialis      Distal anterior humerus      Ulnar tuberosity (Coronoid process)      Elbow flexion (major)      Musculocutaneous nerve              Coracobrachialis      Coracoid Process      Medial humerus      Shoulder flexion and adduction      Musculocutaneous nerve              Brachioradialis      Lateral humerus, supracondylar ridge      Lateral distal radius      Elbow flexion ('thumbs-up')      Radial Nerve      C. Posterior Arm Muscles1. Triceps  O → varies for each of the 3 heads (hence tri-ceps):          Long Head: INFRAGLENOID TUBERCLE of scapula      Medial Head: posterior surface of HUMERUS BELOW radial groove      Lateral Head: posterior surface of HUMERUS ABOVE radial groove         I → proximal OLECRANON process and FOREARM FASCIA via triceps tendon  A → MAJOR extensor of forearm and shoulder  N → Radial nerve (C5,6,7,8, T1)  Blood Supply → profunda brachial artery and branches.  Clinical → tapping triceps tendon used to elicit the triceps jerk tendon reflex to test C7 and C8.  Notes:            The radial nerve runs along a groove on the posterior humerus; this is the radial groove (aka. spiral groove).                  The lateral head attaches above this groove; the medial head attaches below it.                    The long head of the triceps runs between the teres major and teres minor.      The lateral head of the triceps merges with the long head to form the triceps tendon. This then attaches to the olecranon of the elbow.      Between the long head and the lateral head lies the muscle’s blood supply and innervation: the radial nerve and profunda brachii artery.        Reflex Testing Nerve Roots      Biceps reflex → C5,6. (C5,6 pick-up sticks)    Brachioradialis reflex → C6.    Triceps reflex → C7,8 (C7,8, lay them straight).  D. Arterial Supply of the Arm  Subclavian → Axillary → Brachial → Ulnar/Radial Arteries.  The axillary artery becomes the brachial artery past the lower border of the teres major.  Brachial Artery Branches:          Profunda Brachii → recall that this supplies triceps.      Superior Ulnar Collateral      Inferior Ulnar Collateral      Ulnar Artery (medial)      Radial Artery (lateral)        The superior and inferior ulnar collaterals anastamose with ascending recurrent branches to help maintain blood flow to the elbow.  Musculocuntaneous nerve usually pierces coracobrachialis.  Brachial artery can be injured with midshaft or supracondylar fractures of the humerus.  Median nerve is medial to brachial artery near elbow.  Ulnar nerve passes behind the medial epicondyle (Funny Bone); more severe injury can lead to claw hand deformity and numbness.  Radial nerve emerges between brachialis and brachioradialis muscles.E. Common Fracture Sites of the Arm  Surgical Neck          Most common in adults from a fall on an outstretched arm.      Concerned with the axillary nerve, since it passes by the surgical neck.      Hence, you would test the (1) deltoids and (2) teres minor.        Midshaft Fracture          Concerned with the radial nerve (runs along spiral groove).        Supracondylar fracture          Common in children.      Concerned with the ulnar nerve (runs behind the medial epicondyle) and the median nerve.      F. Myotome of Upper and Lower ExtremitiesG.

Appreciate the role of therapeutic exercise in the prevention and rehabilitation of those with musculoskeletal disorders.  Review basic concepts of exercise prescription for healthy populations.  Know the Health Canada guidelines for exercise prescription for muscular strength and endurance.  Objective      Review the basic physiology of skeletal muscle activation.    Neural signals travel from the brain, down through the spinal cord, and into peripheral nerves.  Skeletal muscle activation requires the activation of both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons.          Upper Motor Neuron → Brain &amp; Spinal Cord.      Lower Motor Neuron → the nerves that innervate muscles.        Problems with either can affect muscle activation:          Upper Motor Neuron → stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury.      Lower Motor Neuron → Anterior horn cell disease, peripheral nerve injury, neuromuscular junction disease, muscle/myopathy.        Objective      Review the concept of the motor unit and its role as the functional unit in skeletal muscle contraction.    A motor unit is made up of a motor neuron and the skeletal muscle fibers innervated by that motor neuron’s axonal terminals.          Hence, they’re the main functional unit behind a muscle contraction.        Groups of motor units often work together to coordinate the contractions of a single muscle; all of the motor units within a muscle are considered a motor pool.  A motor unit consists of the following:          Anterior horn cell in the ventral horn of spinal cord      Ventral Root      Myelinated Axon      Neuromuscular Junction      Muscle Fibers      Types of Motor Units  Very broadly speaking, motor units as classified as either Type I, and Type II:  Type I           These have muscle fibres that are involved in low-intensity exercise (walking, standing up, etc), and mainly involve slow-twitch muscle fibres.      These are also smaller motor units, as thus comprise a smaller proportion of the muscle mass.      Metabolically speaking, they are designed to do things for a long period of time (high aerobic endurance, well vascularized, etc).        Type II          Used only with higher intensity exercise, as these require higher intensity contractions to activate.      These are larger, and have a higher force-generating potential.       However, metabolically, they have more glycolysis relative to oxidative phosphorylation.        Hence, the idea behind strngth-training is to use high intensity contractions in order to engage our larger, higher-threshold, fast-twitch motor units.          With disuse, or aging, we have less engagement of these fast-twitch motor units, so we have muscle atrophy.        Objective      Know the different types of skeletal muscle contraction.    Isometric → muscle stays same length  Concentric → muscle shortens longitudinally.  Eccentric → muscle lengthens longitudinally.  Objective      Know the impact of disuse and other forms of injury on skeletal muscle.    Disuse atrophy is commonly seen in clinical practice, and is based on the idea that ‘if you don’t use it, you lose it’.  Commonly seen with:          Immobilization of a joint (casting)      Bed Rest/immobility      Pain (reflex inhibition) → this reduces muscle activation around the site of injury.      Non-weight bearing → for instance, patients in wheelchairs, or astronauts.        One significant study in the impact of disuse was the Dallas Bed Rest Study (1966):          In the study, they put healthy university students in bed-rest for 4-6 weeks with a controlled diet..      Over 2 weeks, found that their muscle strength decreased by 25-40%, with significant decreases in power, endurance, RoM, and balance.      Hence, nowadays, we encourage early mobilization and exercise; this is a substantial shift from historical views that bed rest is better.        Objective      Understand the physiological adaptations that occur in skeletal muscle as a result of resistance exercise.  Muscular Changes with Training  Studied by DeLorme (1945), who popularized the idea of Progressive Resistance Exercise (PRE).  The idea here is to gradually expose the muscle to higher resistance; this increased muscle mass and strength.          In other words, modern-day strength training.        Delorme Axiom (used in most modern-day exercise regimens):          High intensity, low repetition exercise increases strength (8 – 12 repetitions)      Low intensity, high repetition exercise increases endurance (&gt; 15).      This lead to the principle of progressive overload.        How does the muscle change with exercise?          Resistance training results in increased muscle fibre size (25-35%) → in other words, hypertrophy.                  Most of this change is from the Type II muscle fibres (particularly IIA); Type I fibres do not change in size significantly.                    However, there’s less convincing evidence that an increase in fibre number occurs, ie. hyperplasia.                  In other words, your fibres do get bigger, but you probably don’t develop more of them with training.                    This suggests that you’re limited by the amount of muscle fibres you’re genetically endowned with, ie. a genetic potential.        Remember      Resistance training increases muscle fibre size, but it probably does not increase muscle fibre number.    Do you have to ‘injure’ muscle for it to grow?          It’s commonly thought that you have to damage the muscle during training in order to allow it to regrow larger and stronger.      This does play a small role in hypertrophy:                  Muscle injury results in satellite cell activation and proliferation.          These cells then get incorporated into the muscle, increasing muscle size.                    However, it likely does not contribute significantly; most of your increase in strength is due to an increase in the amount of contractile protein (actin, myosin).      Neuromuscular Adaptations to Training  Increases in muscle mass are not the only changes that occur with exercise.  Broadly speaking, we can increase force production in 2 ways:          Increase Central Activation → increase the percent of our muscle mass that’s used.      Increase Total Muscle Mass → increase the amount of muscle mass that’s available to be used, ie. hypertrophy.        Although must people think of #2 when they think of strengthening muscle, in rehab, it’s actually #1 that’s most important:          For instance, in patients with a hip replacement, where rehab is over weeks as opposed to years, the change in function is more due to ‘relearning how to use your muscles’, as opposed to gaining significant amounts of new muscle.        In fact, it’s thought that a significant amount of your early improvement in strength is due to improvements in your muscle recruitment:          “The initial increases in strength on progressive resistance exercise occurs at a rate far greater than can be accounted for by morphological changes within muscle” (De Lorme and Watkins 1951).        As a corollary, free weights often give you faster results than machine training:          This is because the nervous system has to adjust more to the use of free weights as opposed to with a machine.      With free weights, you have to learn how to stabilize etc, which is not necessary with the machine.      So in general, people will improve in strength more quickly with compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, etc) that involve multiple muscle groups.        Objective      Appreciate the role of therapeutic exercise in the prevention and rehabilitation of those with musculoskeletal disorders.    Exercise is extremely important in maintaining health:          Other than smoking cessation, physical inactivity is the most important modifiable risk factor in reducing CV disease and stroke.      However, about 60% of Canadians are not active enough to reap health benefits, and just over 50% of Canadians exercise more than 15 minutes per week.        Exercise has been shown to play a role in the following:          Reducing premature (early) death.      Reducing risk of diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, some cancers, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and depression.      Reduces risk factors for disease, such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.      Improves physical fitness, such as aerobic capacity, and muscle strength and endurance.      Improves functional capacity (the ability to engage in activities needed for daily living).      Improves mental health, such as depression and cognitive function.      Decreases injuries or sudden heart attacks.        Are there cases when you shouldn’t exercise?          Generally, these are fairly rare, but there are scenarios where exercise is counter-productive:                  Acute Muscle Inflammation → actively inflammed muscle will respond poorly to exercise.          Active Inflammatory Joint Disease/Tendonitis.          Systemic Illness → eg. if you have the flu, exercise may exacerbate your illness.          Nutritionally Deficient          Strength Less than Anti-Gravity → ie, you’re so weak due to a progressive nerve/muscle problem, that you can’t even resist gravity.                          If they’re that weak, then doing more with that muscle group probably won’t help.              Attempts at preservation are more effective than recovery.                                            Objective      Review basic concepts of exercise prescription for healthy populations.    Basic Principles of Exercise Prescription          Specificity → specific adapations will occur with specific training interventions (eg. swimming vs. strength training).      Progressive Overload → you have to progressively expose the system to greater stress in order to improve.      Adequate rest and recovery      Detraining → ie, you have to use it or you’ll lose it.        Tips for Exercise Prescription:          Give them SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:      Make sure they know:                  What type of activity are they going to do? → eg. swimming, walking.          How often will they do it? → eg. 3 times a week.          For how long will they do it? → eg. 20 minutes.          How hard will they do it? → eg. 50% of max heart rate.                    To compute the max heart rate, use:                  .          50% of your max heart rate is what’s usually suggested.          Another handy tip is to ‘get to where you’re almost out of breath, but not’.                      Objective      Know the Health Canada guidelines for exercise prescription for muscular strength and endurance.    Health Canada uses the ACSM Guidelines (American College of Sports Medicine).  These are as follows:  Resistance Exercise          8 to 10 exercises involving all major muscle groups      8 - 12 repetitions maximum per set      Minimum of 1 set per exercise      20 minutes vs 60 minutes for three sets, decreases drop‐out rate.        Aerobic Exercise          150 minutes of moderate activity per week      Brisk walking, cycling at moderate pace        For more information, see the following:          http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/paguide.pdf.

Describe the organization of the brachial plexus from root toterminal branches  Identify the nerve supply of all muscle compartments of theupper extremity and map the sensory distribution provided bythe brachial plexus  Differentiate clinically between superior and inferior brachialplexus (i.e., median, radial and ulnar nerves).The Axilla  Axilla → the armpit.  The walls of the axilla are defined as follows:          Anterior → pectoralis major and minor.      Posterior → subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi.      Medial → serratus anterior.      Lateral → Biceps brachii, coracobrachialis.        The epicentre of the axilla is the axillary artery.          The positions of all other structures are defined relative to the axillary artery.      For instance, the cords of the brachial plexus (medial, lateral, posterior) are named for their positions relative to this artery.        Note that the axillary artery is a continuation of the subclavian artery, and continues into the brachial artery.          Before passing the clavicle, the vessel is known as the subclavian artery.      After this, but before passing the lower border of the teres major, it’s then known as the axillary artery.      After this, it’s known as the brachial artery.        Remember      Subclavian Artery → Before passing the clavicle.    Axillary Artery → Between the clavicle and the lower border of the teres major.    Brachial Artery → After the lower border of the teres major.    The axillary artery is contained within the axillary sheath:          The axillary sheath contains:                  Cords of the Brachial Plexus → posterior, middle, and lateral cords.          Axillary Artery.          Axillary Vein.                    As mentioned before, the names of the cords of the brachial plexus are derived from their position relative to the axillary artery (eg. the posterior cord is behind the axillary artery).      The axillary sheath is surrounded by both axillary fat and axillary lymph nodes, which drain the upper limb and 75% of the breast lymph.                  Recall that this was important during breast examinations, because a significant amount of breast cancers would spread to the axillary lymph nodes.                      At the level of the axillary sheath, there are 2 important branches that come off the medial and lateral cord respectively:          Lateral Pectoral Nerve, which comes off of the lateral cord (obviously).                  This travels along the upper margin of the pectoralis minor, innervates it, and then travels to the pectoralis major and innervates that as well.                    Medial Pectoral Nerve, which comes off of the medial cord.                  This pierces the pectoralis minor and then supplies the pectoralis major.                    The Brachial Plexus  The Brachial plexus is an important network of nerves because it innervates the arm.  Damage to different parts of the brachial plexus will result in different, distinctive physical findings.  To describe the branching pattern of the brachial plexus, it’s generally broken down into (1) roots, (2) trunks, (3) divisions, (4) cords, and (5) branches/nerves.          In other words, we look at the nerves as they emerge from their spinal roots, combine to form trunks, split to form divisions, combine to form cords, and finally split off into branches.        To remember this, use the following mnemonic:          Really Thirsty? Drink Cold Beer! (Roots, Trunks, Divisions, Cords, Branches).        Remember      The brachial plexus is divided into:              Roots        Trunks        Divisions        Cords        Branches              Remember this as REALLY THIRSTY? DRINK COLD BEER!  1. Roots  There are 5 spinal nerve roots which form the brachial plexus, C5-T1.          More specifically, these are the ventral rami of each spinal nerve (recall that all plexuses are formed from ventral rami).        In other words, C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 (recall that there are 7 cervical vertebrae, but 8 cervical nerves).          Sometimes C4 can contribute as well → this is known as a pre-fixed (high) brachial plexus (C4-C8).      Similarly, sometimes T2 can contribute → this is known as a post-fixed (low) brachial plexus (C6-T2).        Since these are spinal nerve roots, they’re located paravertebrally.  Two important nerve branches come off at the level of the roots:          Dorsal Scapular Nerve → comes off of C5, and goes on to innervate the levator scapulae, rhomboid minor, and rhomboid major.      Long Thoracic Nerve → comes off of C5, C6, and C7, and travels behind the brachial plexus. It innervates the serratus anterior.      2. Trunks  These 5 nerve roots combine to form 3 trunks, a superior, middle, and inferior trunk:          Superior Trunk → comprised of C5 and C6.      Middle Trunk → comprised of C7.      Inferior Trunk → comprised of C8 and T1.        It’s easy to remember which nerve roots connect to which trunks; the first 2 connect to the superior one, the 3rd connects to the middle, and the last 2 connect to the inferior one.  This merging occurs as these nerves pass through the scalene muscles of the neck → hence these are described as having an interscalene distribution.  At the level of the trunks, there is 1 important branch that comes out:          Suprascapular Nerve, which comes off of the superior cord.                  This is easy to remember → ‘supra’-scapular, and superior cord.          Recall that the suprascapular nerve goes through the suprascapular notch, and then goes on to innervate the supraspinatus and infraspinatus.                    3. Divisions  Each trunk of the brachial plexus gives rise to an anterior and a posterior division.          That is, from the 3 trunks (superior, middle, and inferior), we end up with 6 divisions (each one splits into an anterior and posterior division).        This division occurs around the level of the subclavian artery.  No nerve branches are given off from the divisions.4. Cords  These 6 divisions then merge to produce 3 cords.          Lateral Cord → comprised of the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks.      Posterior Cord → comprised of the 3 posterior divisions from each of the 3 trunks (superior, middle, and inferior).      Medial Cord → comprised of the anterior division of the inferior trunk only.        These were the 3 cords that we mentioned were present in the axilla (in the axillary sheath).          Hence, just like how the subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery past the 1st rib, the divisions become cords.        As mentioned before, the medial pectoral nerve comes off of the medial cord, and the lateral pectoral nerve comes off of the lateral cord.5. Branches/Nerves  The cords split and merge in such a way that 5 branches are created.  These branches are:          Median Nerve → takes contributions from both the lateral and medial cord.      Ulnar Nerve → comes off the medial cord only.      Musculocutaneous Nerve → comes off the &lt;/i&gt;lateral cord&lt;/i&gt; only, and innervates the coracobrachialis muscle.                  In the cadavers, you can actually see the nerve go into the coracobrachialis.                    Axillary Nerve → comes off of the posterior cord, reflects upwards, and then supplies the deltoid and teres minor.      Radial Nerve → also comes off of the posterior cord.        Because of how the nerves arise, an ‘M’ is formed:          The medial nerve is the ‘middle’ of the M.      The ulnar nerve and musculocutaneous nerves are the sides of the M.      The contributions from the lateral and medial root to the median nerve form the ‘angled parts’ of the M.      This has been highlighted below:      Note the 'M' formed by the medial nerve, ulnar nerve, and musculocutaneous nerve.Main Components of The Brachial Plexus            Roots      Trunks      Divisions      Cords      Branches                        	      	  C5		  C6		  C7		  C8		  T1      	                  	      	  Superior		  Middle		  Inferior      	                  	      	  Anterior Superior    	  Posterior Superior    	  Anterior Middle    	  Posterior Middle    	  Anterior Posterior    	  Posterior Posterior      	                  	      	  Lateral		  Posterior		  Medial      	                  	      	  Musculocutaneous Nerve		  Ulnar Nerve		  Median Nerve		  Axillary Nerve		  Radial Nerve      	            This can be remembered as 5-3-6-3-5 &rarr; the number of components in each forms a palindromeAdditional Branches of the Brachial Plexus  In addition to the main branches listed above, there are smaller branches that come off of the brachial plexus at many of the levels (some of which have been mentioned before):  Branches off the Roots          Dorsal Scapular Nerve → innervates the 3 superficial muscles that attach to the medial margin of the scapula (levator scapulae, rhomboid minor, rhomboid major).      Long Thoracic Nerve → innervates the serratus anterior.        Branches off the Trunks          Suprascapular Nerve → innervates the supra- and infraspinatus.        Branches off the Divisions          As mentioned before, there are no branches off the divisions of the brachial plexus.        Branches off the Cords          Medial Cord:                  Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Arm (aka. medial brachial cutaneous nerve).          Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Forearm (aka. medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve).          Medial Pectoral Nerve                    Posterior Cord:                  Upper subscapular nerve → innervates the subscapularis.          Lower subscapular nerve → innervates the teres major and part of the subscapularis.          Thoracodorsal nerve → innervates the latissimus dorsi.                    Lateral Cord:                  Lateral pectoral nerve.                      The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm and forearm are often merged at the level of the cords. In addition, since they’re very close to the ulnar nerve, they’re often mistaken for the ulnar nerve (as part of the ‘M’).Summary of the Brachial PlexusBranches off of the Cords of the Brachial PlexusCombining the 'main branches', and the 'ancillary branches', these are all the nerves that come off of each cord:            Medial Cord      Posterior Cord      Lateral Cord                        	      	  Ulnar Nerve		  Medial Root of the Median Nerve		  Medial Pectoral Nerve		  Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Arm		  Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Forearm      	                  	      	  Radial Nerve		  Axillary Nerve		  Upper Subscapular Nerve		  Lower Subscapular Nerve		  Thoracodorsal Nerve      	                  	      	  Lateral Pectoral Nerve    	  Lateral Root of the Median Nerve    	  Musculocutaneous Nerve      	            To remember the branches of the lateral cord, you can use the Lucy Loves Me mnemonic.  Below is a memory tip to help quickly remember the nerve roots that form each nerve.          Assign each of your fingers to one of the nerve roots of the brachial plexus as follows: C5 = thumb, C6 = index, C7 = middle, C8 = ring, T1 = pinky.        Then, the mnemonics for the nerve roots that comprise each nerve are as follows:          5 mice → the median nerve has all 5 nerve roots, hence ‘5’ ‘M’ice.      5 rats → the radial nerve nerve has all 5 nerve roots as well, hence ‘5’ ‘R’ats.      Assassinated → the Axillary nerve has C5 and C6, hence it forms a gun when you point the corresponding fingers.      3 musketeers → the musculocutaneous nerve has C5,6,7, which correspond to the first 3 fingers.      2 unicorns → the ulnar nerve has C8 and T1, which correspond to the last 2 fingers.      Distribution of the Brachial Plexus  The roots come off paravertebrally.  They merge into trunks as they pass between the scalenus medius and scalenus anterior (ie. interscalene).          Recall that the scalenes comprise of the scalenus anterior, medius, and posterior; the brachial plexus passes between the first 2.      Note that the phrenic nerve (C3,4,5 keeps the diaphragm alive) passes anterior to the brachial plexus, as it’s in front of the scalenus anterior.        These trunks split into divisions at the level of the subclavian.  These divisons merge into cords at the level of the axilla.  These cords split into branches at the level of the arm (brachial).  *Injuries to the brachial plexus are classified as either supraclavicular or subclavicular:          Supraclavicular injuries affect either the roots or the trunks.      Subclavicular injuries affect the divisions, cords, or branches.      Arteries of the Axilla  As we mentioned previously, the axillary artery is just a continuation of the subclavian artery once it crosses the clavicle (and before it passes the teres major, where it becomes the brachial artery).            Recall that the left subclavian artery branches off the aortic arch directly, while the right subclavian artery comes off of the brachiocephalic (innominate) artery.      This makes sense intuitively: since the heart isn’t centred (it’s closer to the left), the right common carotid and right subclavian have to travel further, and hence they’re merged when coming off of the aortic root.        Before the subclavian becomes the axillary artery however, it gives off the thyrocervical trunk, which then splits into 3 branches:          Inferior Thyroid Artery → as we saw in ENT, this supplies the thyroid, along with the superior thyroid artery (the first branch off the external carotid).      Superficial Cervical Artery      Suprascapular Artery → this corresponds with the suprascapular nerve that came off of the superior trunk of the brachial plexus.        The axillary artery is often split into 3 parts based on its location relative to the pectoralis minor:          Part 1 → Proximal to Pectoralis minor (before it crosses the pec minor).      Part 2 → Posterior to Pectoralis minor (as it runs behind pec minor).      Part 3 → Distal to Pectoralis minor (as it goes beyond pec minor).        The utility of this classification scheme is that not only helps you remember the branches of the axillary artery, but also their location.          Part 1 has 1 major branch:                  Superior Thoracic Artery                    Part 2 has 2 major branches:                  Thoracoacromial Artery          Lateral Thoracic Artery                    Part 3 has 3 major branches:                  Posterior Circumflex Humeral Artery          Anterior Circumflex Humeral Artery          Subscapular Artery                      The thoracoacromial artery further splits into 4 branches to supply the surrounding muscles: pectoral, acromial, clavicular, and deltoid branches.  The lateral thoracic artery runs with the long thoracic nerve, which we saw came off of the roots of the brachial plexus, and innervated the serratus anterior.          Hence, it makes sense that the lateral thoracic artery feeds the serratus anterior, since it runs with the nerve that innervates it.        The posterior circumflex humeral artery and anterior circumflex humeral artery are named as such because they wrap around the surgical neck of the humerus.  The subscapular artery continues as the thoracodorsal artery, once it gives off the circumflex scapular artery:          The thoracodorsal artery feeds the latissimus dorsi, just like how the thoracodorsal nerve innervates it.      The circumflex scapular artery runs through the triangular space which we discussed in Anatomy of the Shoulder.      Branches of the Axillary ArteryCombining the 'main branches', and the 'ancillary branches', these are all the nerves that come off of each cord:            Before Pec Minor      Behind Pec Minor      After Pec Minor                        	      	  Superior Thoracic Artery      	                  	      	  Thoracoacromial Artery		  Lateral Thoracic Artery      	                  	      	  Subscapular Artery      	  Anterior Circumflex Humeral Artery      	  Posterior Circumflex Humeral Artery      	            To remember the number of branches, note that 'Part 1' has 1 branch, 'Part 2' has 2 branches, and 'Part 3' has 3 branches.To remember the names of the branches, use the Screw The Lawyer's, Save A Patient mnemonic (Superior Thoracic, Thoracoacromial, Lateral Thoracic, Subscapular, Anterior Circumflex Humeral, Posterior Circumflex Humeral.Clinical Findings with Brachial Plexus Injuries  Upper Plexus Injury          Results in Erb-Duchenne Palsy.      Erb-Duchenne Palsy typically arises when someone is thrown off of a horse or motorcycle, and lands on the ground on the side of their neck. It’s also commonly caused with shoulder dystocia with macrosomic babies.      These injuries forcibly pull the head apart from the shoulder, which stretches the upper parts ot the brachial plexus, namely C5 and C6.      This results in the following:                  Loss of shoulder abduction (deltoid), since it’s innervated by the axillary nerve, which arises from C5 and C6.          Loss of lateral rotation of arm (infraspinatus), since it’s innervated from the suprascapular nerve, which comes off the superior trunk (off C5 and C6).          Loss of elbow flexion and supination (biceps brachii and brachialis) which are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve.                          Recall that the musculocutaneous nerve comes off the lateral cord, which comes off the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks, which come off of C5, C6, and C7.                                          The sum total of all these effects is a waiter’s-tip deformity:                  Since the arm can’t laterally rotate, flex, supinate, or abduct, it stays close to the body, with the wrist pronated.          There may also be loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the shoulder, arm and lateral forearm.                      Radial Nerve Injury:          Results in a wrist drop, since the radial nerve innervates the extrinsic extensors of the wrist.      Without the action of the extensors, the wrist is flexed.        Ulnar Nerve Injury:          Results in a ulnar claw, aka. Klumpke’s paralysis.        Medial Nerve Injury:          Results in a Hand of Benediction sign when you try to make a fist.      The medial nerve plays a role in flexion of the thumb, index finder, and half of the middle finger, so when it’s damaged, they can’t be flexed with the other fingers.

Understand treatment options for 3 common shoulder disorders.          Instability → seen in younger patients.      Rotator Cuff Disease → seen in middle-aged patients.      Arthritis → seen in old patients.        Common Shoulder Disorders      Instability → seen in younger patients.    Rotator Cuff Disease → seen in middle-aged patients.    Arthritis → seen in old patients.  Shoulder Instability  Shoulder Instability → the inability to keep the humeral head centered within the glenoid cavity.          This can be seen on the right: the glenoid fossa is not adjacent to the head of the humerus, so the joint is dislocated.        Classifying Shoulder Instability:          Onset → was there associated trauma?                  In other words, was it traumatic, or atraumatic?                    Direction → anterior, posterior, inferior, or some combination of these.      Degree of instability → subluxation vs. dislocation.                  Subluxation → incomplete/partial dislocation.                      Broadly speaking, shoulder instability is classified as either traumatic or atraumatic.          Traumatic shoulder instability is seen after a trauma, ie. it’s ‘torn loose’.      Atraumatic shoulder instability is due to some sort of inherent weakness of the joint, ie. it’s ‘born loose’.        Atraumatic instability is often associated with connective tissue disorders.Traumatic vs. Atraumatic Shoulder Instability            Traumatic      Atraumatic                        	      	  Unidirectional		  Anterior &gt;&gt; Posterior		  'Torn loose'		  Surgery is often required      	            				  Multidirectional		  'Born loose'		  Primary treatment is rehab		  Surgery is uncommon		              Anatomic Factors that play a role in shoulder instability include:          Ligaments → tearing or stretching of the ligaments around the glenohumeral joint.      Labrum → if this is torn, it weakens the connection between the humerus and glenoid cavity.      Bones      Rotator cuff/muscle forces.      Nerves      Traumatic Instability  Management of Shoulder Dislocation:            X-rays → again, taken before and after the reduction.      Neurologic Exam → this is done before and after reduction to ensure that there’s (1) no nerve issue beforehand, and that (2) you didn’t cause a new nerve issue.      Reduction → this usually involves manipulation of the joint until it ‘pops’ back in, with a counter-traction applied via a sheet to facilitate this movement.        Long-term Treatment:          If you’re a younger patient (&lt;20), the treatment of choice is a surgical repair, because of the high risk of recurrent dislocations.      Furthermore, recurrent dislocations predisposes patients to arthritis.      If you’re an older patient, surgery is not suggested, since there’s a lower risk of recurrent dislocations (typically joints get less flexible as we age).        Surgical Treatment Options:          Capsule-Labral Repair → done if the labrum has torn off.      Bone defect reconstruction → done if there’s a Hill Sach’s Lesion:                  Hill Sachs lesion → a dent at the back of the humeral head that occurs when the shoulder dislocates.          Because the head of the humerus is much softer than the glenoid fossa, it can actually get deformed when smashed against the glenoid.          This results in a Hill Sach’s lesion.                    Atraumatic Instability  One common acronym that’s used is MDI: multidirectional instability.  These are best described with the AMBRI acronym:          A → Atraumatic.      M → Multidirectional.      B → Bilateral.      R → Rehab responsive.      I → Inferior Capsular Shift rarely required.        In other words, these patients are atraumatic, and frequently have multidirectional and bilateral dislocations. The treatment of choice is rehab, but if that fails, an inferior capsule shift can be done.          Inferior capsule Shift → open laparoscopic over-sewing of stretched out glenohumeral ligaments.      This has a 70% success rate.      Rotator Cuff Disease  Rotator Cuff Disease → degeneration of the rotator cuff.          This is the most common shoulder disorder.      Has an increased prevalence with age, typical onset is in the 40’s.      Considered to be progressive.        Recall that the rotator cuff muscles were the:          Supraspinatus      Infraspinatus      Teres Minor      Subscapularis        Although these play a small role in broader motions of the shoulder (see Anatomy of the Shoulder), their primary role is the stabilize the shoulder joint.          This makes sense → these muscles are much smaller than the latissimus dorsi or pectoralis major, for instance.        Pathophysiology of Rotator Cuff Disease:          What makes the tendons of the rotator cuff weak?      Generally causes can be categorized as intrinsic to the tendon, extrinsic to the tendon, or a combination of the two.      Intrinsic Causes → factors intrinsic to the tendon.                  Decreased tendon vascularity.          Tension overload → long-term tendon use strains them.          Tendon degeneration → due to decreased vascularity, reduced water content, decreased collagen cross-linking.                    Extrinsic Causes                  Acromion morphology → when you lift your arm, the rotator cuff rubs against the acromion.                          As we age, the acromion becomes more hooked, and becomes more likely to scrape against the tendon.                                            Findings with Rotator Cuff Disease:          Basically 3 symptoms:                  Restricted motion.          Pain.          Weakness                    On physical exam:                  Active motion &lt;&lt; Passive motion.          In other words, when you ask the patient to move their arm, it moves a lot less than when you move their arm for them.          When the active motion is much smaller than the passive motion, it suggests that the joint itself is fine, but there’s a nerve/muscle/brain/spinal cord problem.          In particular, weakness is seen with movements associated with the cuff muscles.                    Signs of Impinged Nerves                  These signs are based on the idea of taking a damaged tendon and hitting them against a solid structure.            Neer’s Sign → where you take the arm and lift it up. As you lift it up, the damaged part of the supraspinatus will abut against the acromion, and cause pain.                          This shoulder flexion can be combined with pronation to further exacerbate impingement.                                  Hawkins Sign → same idea to Neer’s sign, except with shoulder flexion and internal rotation to cause impingement.                          This combination of movements decreases the space in the subacromial space, thus leading to impingement.                                  Painful Arc → when you try to make a ‘snow-angel’, it hurts, since the tendon abuts against the lateral acromion.                          Unlike the other two, this is an active movement, and not a passive movement.              Pain should be felt between 60 and 120 degrees (hence the ‘painful arc’).                                            Signs of Impinged Nerves                    Test        Approach                            Neer’s Sign        Passively raise the arm in the plane of the scapula                    Hawkins Sign        Passively flex and internally rotate the shoulder                    Painful Arc        Abduct the arms              Classification of Rotator Cuff Disease          Stage I → the tendon is painful, but it’s grossly intact.                  There’s inflammation, but structurally it’s intact.                    Stage II → partial thickness defect.      Stage III → full thickness defect.                  This is known as a rotator cuff tear.                    Rotator Cuff Arthropathy (Stage IV) → massive defect in the cuff.                  It’s called rotator cuff arthropathy when the cuff can no longer function in maintaining the stability of the glenohumeral joint.          The head fails to remain centred in the glenoid fossa, and begins to migrate superiorly, and rub against the acromion. This results in arthritis.                      Classification of Rotator Cuff Disease      Stage I → the tendon is painful, but structurally intact.    Stage II → partial thickness defect.    Stage III → full thickness defect (rotator cuff tear).    Rotator Cuff Arthropathy (Stage IV) → when cuff damage results in the head of the humerus displacing and rubbing against the acromion, leading to arthritis (hence ‘arthropathy’).    Treatment of Rotator Cuff Disease          Activity Modification → stop doing the things that make the shoulder sore.      Pain Management → NSAIDs.      Physiotherapy → this is the mainstay of treatment for patients with rotator cuff disease. 75% of patients will get better with physiotherapy.      Injections      Surgery        Surgical Treatment of Rotator Cuff Disease          Generally, surgical treatment is very rare, because PT is tremendously effective.      Surgery is only indicated if:                  Pain persists after an appropriate course of physiotherapy (12 weeks).          Weakness          Following an acute injury (eg. a young patient where the rotator cuff is torn due to sudden trauma, and not long-term degradation).                    Approaches for surgical repair are:                  Stage I → subacromial decompression.          Stage II → subacromial decompression +/- RC repair.                          In this group, it’s controversial whether adding the rotator cuff repair is superior over subacromial decompression only.                                Stage III → subacromial decompression + RC repair.          Stage IV (RC Arthropathy) → shoulder repair.                          Since there’s arthritis and muscle damage, more than just the rotator cuff has to be repaired.                                          Subacromial decompression → this aims to increase the size of the subacromial region to decrease rotator cuff pressure.      Rotator Cuff Repair → surgical repair of rotator cuff defects.      Arthritis  Shoulder Arthritis → typically due to osteoarthritis of the shoulder.          Osteoarthritis is characterized by joint space narrowing, due to wearing down of the cartilage.      Along the margins of the bones, osteophytes are often seen.      As this worsens, subchondral cysts (geodes) form near the articular surface.        Features of Shoulder Arthritis:          Shoulder arthritis is a disorder of progressive pain and stiffness, as a result of (1) cartilage loss and (2) osteophyte formation.      Arthritis can be classified as either noninflammatory or inflammatory.      Inflammatory vs Noninflammatory Shoulder Arthritis            Inflammatory      Noninflammatory                        	      	  Rheumatoid		  Psoriatic		  Crystalline (gout, CPPD)      	            				  Osteoarthritis		  Post-traumatic		              Clinical Features of Osteoarthritis          Deep aching shoulder discomfort.      Both reduced active motion and passive motion:                  Compare this to rotator cuff disease, where active motion is impaired, but passive motion is normal.          Both active and passive motion are impaired here because there are structural joint abnormalities (eg. osteophytes).                    In these cases, the rotator cuff strength is usually actually intact.        Remember      With rotator cuff disease, active motion deteriorates, but passive motion is largely normal.    With osteoarthritis, both active motion and passive motion deteriorate.    Treatment of Shoulder Arthritis → basically the same treatment modalities as we’ve seen previously:          Activity Modification      Analgesics      PT → exercise program.      Surgery        Surgical Treatment of Shoulder Arthritis:          Debridement → typically reserved for young patients.                  This is not curative, because the structural damage to the joint is still there.          However, it does alleviate the sensation of the joint ‘catching’.          Joint replacements are avoided in younger patients because they wear out over time.                    Joint Replacement → replacement of both the humerus and glenoid.                  All arthritis tissue is removed, and is replaced with a metal surface.          Generally have good outcomes (85% good/excellent), and 90% of replacements last 10 years.          Durability is similar to other prostheses.                    ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/21/approach-shoulder.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Shoulder", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe the shoulder (glenohumeral) joint and identify key features of this joint.  Describe and identify key elements of the two joints (sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular) associated with the shoulder joint.  Predict how joint stability would be affected with an injury to each joint.  Compare radiographs of shoulder separations and dislocations.Bones &amp; Ligaments of the ShoulderSurface Landmarks of the Glenohumeral Joint  Anterior Surface Landmarks:          Clavicle.      Acromioclavicular Joint → the joint between the acromion and the clavicle.      Coracoid Process → this is a hook-like protrusion on the front of the scapula where a lot of structures attach.      Greater tuberosity → this is the larger, lateral bump at the head of the humerus.        Posterior Surface Landmarks:          Medial border of the scapula.      Spine of the scapula.      Bones of the Shoulder  The glenohumeral joint, aka. the shoulder joint, is formed by the connection between the scapula and the head of the humerus.  The part of the scapula where the humerus inserts is called the glenoid cavity.          In addition to the cavity itself, there’s a fibrocartilaginous ring that surrounds the outside, to give it more depth.      This is known as the glenoid labrum; this is what tears when you have a labrum tear.        For an introduction to the movement of the joint, see Scapulohumeral Rhythm.1. Features of the Scapula  Since the scapula is shaped somewhat like a triangle, it has 3 angles associated with it: the inferior, lateral, and superior angles.  Similarly, it also has 3 borders (edges) associated with it: the medial, lateral, and superior border.  On the front of the scapula is a hook-like projection called the coracoid process, where a lot of structures attach.          One example of an attaching structure is the coracoclavicular ligament, which, as its name implies, connects the coracoid process and the clavicle. This works together with the acromioclavicular joint to connect the clavicle to the scapula.        On the back of the scapula is a bony projection called the spine of the scapula; it terminates at the acromion process, which is the part of the spine that attaches to the clavicle.  Logically, the cavities formed by the space above and below the spine are called the supraspinous fossa and infraspinous fossa respectively.  The space on the anterior side of the scapula is the subscapular fossa.  Immediately above and below the glenoid cavity are two tubercles where muscles can attach:          Supraglenoid Tubercle, where the long head of the biceps attaches.      Infraglenoid Tubercle, where the triceps attaches.        Finally, immediately medial to the coracoid process is the suprascapular notch, which is effectively a ‘foramen’ because the top part is covered by a ligament called the superior transverse scapular ligament:          This notch is important because the suprascapular nerve runs through it.      Interestingly, the suprascapular artery generally follows the path of the nerve, but when it reaches the suprascapular notch, it actually goes above the ligament, and not through the notch.      2. Features of the Humerus  The head of the humerus has 2 important tubercles on which muscles attach, the greater tubercle, and the lesser tubercle.          The lesser tubercle is more medial and anterior.      The greater tubercle is more lateral and posterior.        The groove between the greater and lesser tubercle is known as the bicipital groove, or the intertubular sulcus.  The top of the bicipital groove is covered by a ligament called the transverse humeral ligament.          This prevents the biceps tendon (which sits inside the groove) from falling out.      Recall that the long head of the biceps attaches to the supraglenoid tubercle, and travels down the bicipital groove.        Importantly, the head of the humerus is way larger than the size of the glenoid cavity, where it inserts.          This improves joint mobility, but it also sacrifices joint stability.      In other words, the joint has a wider range of motion, but it’s more susceptible to dislocation.        The humerus has 2 ‘necks’:          Anatomical Neck → the neck around the rounded part of the humerus which inserts into the joint.      Surgical Neck → the line around the thicker part of the humerus itself.        This is important because the synovial fibrous capsule covers the region past the anatomic neck, but the structures that attach to the humerus itself attach to the area between the anatomic and surgical neck.3. Features of the Clavicle  The clavicle is an s-shaped bone that goes from the sternum to the scapula.          Medially, it articulates with the sternum.      Laterally, it articulates with the acromion of the scapula.        On the lateral end of the clavicle, there are projections of bone, where ligaments attach:          Conoid Tubercle → where the conoid ligament attaches.      Trapezoid Line → where the trapezoid ligament attaches.        Importantly, the conoid ligament and the trapezoid ligament are collectively referred to as the coracoclavicular ligament, which we saw previously.          As mentioned before, this goes between the clavicle and the coracoid process of the scapula, and functions to further attach the two.        In addition to the coracoclavicular ligament, the clavicle is also attached to the scapula via the acromioclavicular joint.  Review on a Radiograph        Scapula    Clavicle    Coracoid process    Glenoid cavity    Acromion    Head of humerus    Greater tubercle    Anatomical neck of humerus    Surgical neck of humerus  Ligaments of the Shoulder  The pectoral girdle (aka. shoulder girdle) is the set of bones which connect the upper limb to the axial skeleton on each side. In other words, this is the clavicle and scapula.  When the arm moves, the pectoral girdle actually moves at 3 locations:          Sternoclavicular Joint → between the medial clavicle and the sternum.      Acromioclavicular Joint → between the lateral clavicle and the acromion of the scapula.      Glenohumeral Joint → between the glenoid fossa of the scapula and the humerus.        Each joint is reinforced by ligaments, as follows:          Sternoclavicular Joint:                  The joint itself is very strong; the clavicle will actually fracture before the joint gets dislocated.          In addition, the sternoclavicular joint is reinforced by 3 ligaments that surround it:                          Sternoclavicular ligaments              Interclavicular ligaments              Costoclavicular ligaments                                As their names suggest, these connect the sternal end of the clavicle to the (1) sternum, (2) other clavicle, and (3) ribs respectively.                    Acromioclavicular Joint:                  There are 2 main ligaments that support this joint.                          Acromioclavicular ligament              Coracoclavicular ligament                                The acromioclavicular ligament covers the acromioclavicular joint.          The coracoclavicular ligament was the ligament we mentioned previously, which comprised of the trapezoid ligament and the conoid ligament.                          Recall that the trapezoid ligament originated at the trapezoid line, and the the conoid ligament originated at the conoid tubercle.              Both attach to the coracoid process.                                          Glenohumeral Joint                  As mentioned before, this joint is particularly weak because the glenoid fossa is much smaller than the head of the humerus (in order to maximize mobility).          As a result, there are a number of important ligaments that prevent dislocations.                          Coracoacromial Ligament               3 Glenohumeral Ligaments → superior, middle, and inferior.                                The coracoacromial ligament is particularly important because it’s a strong ligament that prevents the humerus from dislocating superiorly, by blocking its upward motion.          The glenohumeral ligaments reinforce the humerus from its sides.          Near the bottom of the joint, the ligaments are looser, and form an outpouching called the axillary recess.                          The reason this exists is because the redundant joint tissue is necessary for when the arm is abducted.                                            What part of the glenohumeral joint is weakest?          In other words, if there was a dislocation, where would it be?      This would be the anterior aspect of the joint, since you only have weaker ligamentous support, no strong coracoacromial ligament, and no bony support (ie. scapular support).        Summary of Shoulder Ligaments      Each of the 3 joints of the pectoral girdle are strengthened by ligaments, as follows:    Sternoclavicular Joint              Sternoclavicular ligament.        Interclavicular ligament.        Costoclavicular ligament.              Acromioclavicular Joint              Acromioclavicular ligament.        Coracoclavicular ligament (trapezoid + conoid ligaments).              Glenohumeral Joint              Glenohumeral ligaments.        Coracoacromial ligament              With respect to shoulder stability, the coracoacromial ligament is most important, because it helps prevent superior dislocations of the shoulder.    Clinical Application  A separated shoulder, aka. a sprung shoulder, is when there’s a dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint.          Often seen with injuries where the patient falls on an outstretched arm.        This may include disruption of the surrounding ligaments as well (ie. the acromioclavicular ligament and coracoclavicular ligament).  With more severe injury, the clavicle or acromion can be fractured as well.AP radiograph of normal shoulder on left. The right image shows a patient with a separated (sprung) shoulder. Note that the acromioclavicular joint is separated.Muscles of the Shoulder  The muscles that move the shoulder can be classified as anterior/posterior, superficial/deep, or intrinsic/extrinsic.          Extrinsic muscles refer to muscles that originate outside the shoulder, and attach to it.      Intrinsic muscles refer to muscles that both originate and attach to the shoulder.        Generally, the function of the muscles can be intuited from their origin and attachment.Posterior Extrinsic Muscles1. Superficial Muscles  Trapezius Muscle          Superior fibres elevate and laterally rotate the scapula.      Middle fibres retract the scapula.      Inferior fibres depress and medially rotate the scapula.      Innervated by the Spinal Accessory Nerve (CNXI).        Latissimus Dorsi          Originates at the thoracolumbar fascia, and attaches to the floor of the bicipital groove (between the teres major and pec major → ie. the ‘lady between the two majors’).      This helps medially rotate (internally rotate), adduct, and extend the arm; hence, it’s useful in swimming, rowing, and climbing.      Innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve.        2. Deep Muscles  Levator Scapulae → raises the scapula.          Innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve.        Rhomboids → both the rhomboid major and rhomboid minor retract the scapulae medially.          These are used when you’re ‘bracing’ or squaring your shoulders.      Another example is when you’re scratching your shoulder, as that also involves moving the scapula towards the midline.      Both are innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve.        Anterior Extrinsic Muscles1. Superficial Muscles  Pectoralis Major          This has 2 heads:                  Clavicular Head → arises from the medial 1/3 to 1/2 of the clavicle.          Sternal Head → arises along the lateral border of the sternum.                    As we saw before, this attaches to the lip of the bicipital groove, to one side of the latissiumus dorsi (recall, the ‘lady between the two majors’).      The pec major is the ‘bench press’ muscle; it flexes, medially rotates and adducts the arm.      The same nerves that innervate the pectoralis major innervate the pectoralis minor.        2. Deep Muscles  Serratus Anterior          This functions as the ‘boxer’s muscle’ → since it goes from the medial scapula to the ribs, it functions to bring the scapula forward on the chest wall.                  This is useful in reaching/pushing movements of the arm (eg. in boxing).                      Pectoralis Minor          Deep to the pec major.      Pectoralis minor assists the serratus anterior in protracting the scapula; ie. it also helps with the pushing and reaching motions of the arm.      Pectoralis minor originates at the 3,4,5 ribs, and attach to the coracoid process.

Recall that the serratus anterior and pectoralis minor normally work together to protract the scapula.      When the long thoracic nerve is paralyzed, the coracoid process gets pulled forward by the pectoralis minor, but the serratus anterior is no longer holding the scapula firmly.        This results in winging of the scapula  Remember      Paralysis of the long thoracic nerve that innervates the serratus anterior results in winging of the scapula.  Intrinsic Muscles  As mentioned before, the intrinsic muscles of the shoulder are the ones that are fully contained within the shoulder.  These include the following:          Supraspinatus      Infraspinatus      Teres Minor      Subscapularis      Deltoid Muscle      Teres Major        The Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Minor and Subscapularis collectively form what’s known as the rotator cuff.          You can remember this as SITS → Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Minor, Subscapularis.        Supraspinatus           This is the muscle covering the scapula, above the spine of the scapula.      The supraspinatus tendon of the muscle is the most commonly torn out of all of the rotator cuff muscles (see right).                  This is usually as a result of sporting injuries.                    Along with the deltoid, this initiates the first 15° of arm abduction.                  To remember this, note that the supraspinatus attaches to the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus; hence when it’s pulled, the arm moves away from the body.                      Infraspinatus           This is the muscle covering the scapula, below the spine of the scapula.      This attaches to the middle facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus; hence, when it’s pulled, it rotates the arm laterally.      Hence this functions as a lateral rotator of the humerus.      Note that both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus are innervated by the same nerve: the suprascapular nerve (C5, C6).                   Recall that this nerve was the one that went through the suprascapular notch, right beside the coracoid process.                      Teres Minor          This attaches to the inferior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus.                  Note that the supraspinatus attaches to the superior facet, the infraspinatus attaches to the middle facet, and the teres minor attaches to the inferior facet.          This can be remembered as SIT, which corresponds to superior, middle, and inferior attachments respectively.                    Hence, when it’s pulled, it also laterally rotates the humerus, but it also functions as a weak adductor.      Unlike the suprascapularis and infrascapularis, the teres minor is innervated by the axillary nerve (C5, C6).        Subscapularis           Recall that the subscapular fossa was the fossa on the other side of the scapula.      The muscle that originates there is the subscapularis.      Unlike the previous 3 ‘SIT’ muscles, which attach to different parts of the greater tubercle, the subscapularis goes over the anterior side of the humerus, and then attaches to the lesser tubercle.                  As a result, when the subscapularis is pulled, it actually medially rotates the arm.                    It’s innervated by the upper and lower subscapular nerves.        Deltoid           The deltoid is comprised of 3 sets of fibres that can act both independently or together.                  Anterior Fibres → attach to the lateral clavicle.          Middle Fibres → attach to the acromion.          Posterior Fibres → attach to the lower edge of the scapular spine.                    In other words, the anterior fibres attach to the front of the shoulder, the middle fibres attach to the side, and the posterior fibres attach to the back.                  All 3 of them attach to the deltoid tuberosity on the humerus.                    This makes it easy to determine their action:                  Anterior Fibres → flex, adduct, and weakly medially rotate the arm (assisting the pectoralis major).          Middle Fibres → abduct the arm.          Posterior Fibres → extend, adduct, weakly and laterally rotate the arm (assisting the latissimus dorsi).                    The middle fibres are the strongest, as they’re in a multipennate arrangement:                  Multipennate → where the central tendon of the muscle branches within a pennate muscle.          Pennate Muscle → where the fibres of the muscle attach obliquely to the tendon. This increases force production at the expense of ROM.                    All 3 groups of fibres are innervated by the axillary nerve.        Teres Major           The teres major is often referred to as the ‘baby lats’, because they perform the same function as the latissimus dorsi, just more weakly.                  These were medial rotation, adduction, and extension of the arm.                    As we mentioned before, this attaches to the medial edge of the bicipital groove (it’s the second major in the ‘lady between two majors’).      It’s innervated by the lower subscapular nerve, which is similar to the subscapularis.

Lower Triangular Space.        All 3 are bordered by the long head of the triceps.  For a description of the 3, see the following:                   Borders      Key Contents                  Quadrangular Space      	    	      Teres minor superiorly.

Bursae of the Shoulder Joint  Bursa → a bag of synovial fluid outside the joint itself.          Bursae function to prevent the rubbing of bone on muscle, or ligament on bone, etc.      Some are continuous with one another; others are discrete.      When the bursa are inflammed (bursitis), drugs can be injected directly into them.        If the subacromial or subdeltoid bursa are inflammed (see right), then then it’ll make abduction of the arm painful.          Since the supraspinatus helps with the first 15° of rotation, this pain is most pronounced at around the 40°-120° point.      This is referred to as painful arc syndrome.

	{"title": "Injections in the Treatment of Low Back Pain", "text": "Epidemiology of Chronic Back Pain  Prevalence: 28% in Canada  5-10% of patients with low back pain (LBP) develop chronic pain  Low back pain is the most common chronic pain syndrome seen in pain clinics.  However, much like the common cold, we have no cure for chronic back pain; treatment is based on management of the symptoms.Management Principles with Low Back Pain  Probably the most important part of the lecture:          Injections play a role, but they are limited.      Physical therapy, and cognitive therapy, can play a significant role in managing pain (they’re not just adjunctive treatments!)      In particular, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has a great deal of evidence supporting its use.      It’s often important to tell patients to practice pacing.                   Rather than going bonkers in moments when the pain is gone, it’s better not to push yourself.          In fact, often the worst pain seen with LBP are on the days following the ‘good days’, when the patients push themselves too far.                      Treatment outcomes should by assessed by changes in both function and pain.The Role of Injections in Chronic Pain  Injections aren’t always done solely to relieve pain; they can be used for any of the following purposes:          Diagnostic → help determine the site of pain origin.                  If a local injection relieves pain significantly, then there may be an anatomic cause that can be remedied.                    Prognostic → predict the efficacy of future therapies.                  It’s better to pursue interventions after knowing if they’ll be efficacious or not.          If a local injection improves pain, then it’s more likely than an intervention will be effective.                    Therapeutic → reduce pain and enable rehabilitation.      Contraindications to Injection Therapies  Coagulopathy → bleeding disorders or anticoagulation could result in compressive hematomas of the spine.  Pregnancy → relative contraindication; a lot of these injections use fluoroscopy, so there’s a risk of radiation exposure to the baby.  Infection → current infection + exposure to spinal structures = bad idea.  Lack of patient consent/cooperation.  Unknown neurologic deficit.  Inadequate equipment/inability to manage emergency situtations.  Inadequate assistance or monitoring.  Inability to properly position patient.Complications of Injection Therapies  Failure to produce desired results.  Local Complications: pain, bruising, infection, muscle spasm, needle trauma. Pain and bruising are fairly common, but minor.  Systemic Toxicity: local anesthetic, epinephrine (eg. ↑HR with excess), allergic reactions.  Neurologic Complications: nerve damage (very rare), unwanted spread of local anesthetic to adjacent neural structures.  Vascular Injury: Artery of Adamkiewicz, segmental arteries, epidural veins.          Artery of Adamkiewicz: an important segmental feeder of the spinal cord, generally located in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar region. Damage to it will impair spinal blood flow.      Approach to Low Back Pain Intervention  Generally, your approach focuses on differentiating between radicular pain (due to nerve root irritation), or axial pain (which causes local irritation).          As seen in previous lectures, radicular pain will radiate, while axial pain will cause local symptoms.      Knowing the localization helps guide your injection locale.        Does imaging help with our treatment approach?          To a certain extent, but unfortunately, imaging usually isn’t particularly useful.      Although patients with chronic back pain do have an increase in anatomic abnormalities on imaging (eg. disc herniation), many asymptomatic patients have these findings as well!      As such, it’s impossible to determine whether a patient has back pain or not from their imaging findings, and it’s difficult to say whether one particular anatomic abnormality is the cause of the pain.      Common Causes of Chronic Low Back Pain1. Facet Joint Mediated Pain  Recall that the facet joint was formed between the superior and inferior articular facets of adjacent vertebrae.  These are true joints: they’re lined with synovium and have a true joint capsule.  The medial branches of the dorsal rami innervate the facet joints; so pain can be felt here.  Each facet joint receives innervation from two spinal levels.          That is, the medial branches of the dorsal rami coming from the spinal level above and below the facet joint.        Treatment options for Facet Joint Mediated Pain:          Intra-articular Injections → steroids are injected into the facet joint, via X-ray/US guidance.                  Provides pain relief that lasts a few months.                    Medial Branch Rhizotomy → burning of the medial branches of the dorsal rami that innervate the facet joint in question.                  Gives longer-lasting pain relief to patients (8-12 months).          However, before actually burning the nerve, a ‘simulated rhizotomy’ must be done first, where a local anesthetic nerve block is tried on the joint.          If that reduces pain, then we know that the facet joint is the pain source, and that rhizotomy will be effective.                      Is there good evidence for the use of these treatments?          Intra-articular Injections → poor evidence; seems to be limited to clinical experience and observational studies.                  Moderate evidence actually suggests that facet injections are not much different from placebo for short term pain relief and improvement from disability.                    Medial Branch Rhizotomies → more robust evidence.                  One randomized trial does see significant improvement at 6 months (although only with a sample size of 40).          Other observational studies agree with this.

Intervertebral Disc Mediated Pain  Recall that the interverebral disc is comprised of an inner nucleus pulosus and an outer annulus fibrosus.          The annular layer receives sensory innervation from a variety of sources.      In particular, on the posterior side (where most disc herniations occur), the annulus receives innervation from the sinuvertebral nerves.                  The sinuvertebral nerves are also known as the recurrent meningeal nerves, or the recurrent nerves of Luschka.                    The nucleus pulposus has no sensory innervation; hence, when the disc herniates, it’s the sensory fibres in the annulus or the surrounding tissue that trigger pain.        Treatment options for Intervertebral Disc Mediated Pain:            Interdiscal Electrothermal Therapy → uses heat to modify the collagen fibres of the disc and destroy local pain receptors.                  Heating of the disc is done with a special wire, called an electrothermal catheter.          Long-term effects of this procedure are not known.                      Disc Biacuplasty → two probes are inserted obliquely into the disc from either side, and then a current running from one probe to the other ‘deactivates’ the sensory nerve fibres in the disc.                  Requires sufficient disc height in order to insert the probes.                      Is there good evidence for the use of these treatments?          Interdiscal Electrothermal Therapy → moderate for short term discogenic pain, but we have no idea what long term consequences are.      Disc Biacuplasty → limited for short term improvement, but intermediate for long term improvement (6 months).

Sacroiliac Joint Mediated Pain  The sacroiliac joints are formed by the articular surfaces of the sacrum and the iliac bones.   They bear the weight of the trunk, and hence are subject to the development of strain and arthritis.  Studies have attempted to identify referral patterns for SI joint mediated pain, and have suggested the following:          Buttock, lower lumbar region, lower extremity, groin, upper lumbar region, and abdomen.      This can often mimic sciatica, except it won’t go past the knee, will be more deep seated, and will be described more as joint pain (aching) vs nerve pain (burning).        Although dozens of physical exam tests have been proposed for identifying SI joint problems, evidence suggests that no Hx or P/E findings are consistently capable of differentiating them.  Treatment options for Sacroiliac Joint Mediated Pain:          SI Joint Injections → local anesthetic and steroid are injected into the SI joint.                  Analogous to an intra-articular injection to the facet joint.                    SI Joint Radiofrequency Neurotomy → radiofrequency ablation of nerves to the SI joint.                    Analogous to medial branch rhizotomy with the facet joint.          The nerves that are targeted are mainly lateral branches from S1/S2 that come out of the dorsal foramen of the sacrum and feed the SI joint.          Hence, we basically go down in a line, and burn all the nerves lateral to the dorsal foramina.                      Is there good evidence for the use of these treatments?          SI Joint Injections → limited for both short and long-term relief (just like injections to the facet joint).      SI Joint Radiofrequency Ablation → limited as well.

Advanced Pain Therapies  Some advanced pain therapies include:          Spinal Cord Stimulation                   This is where a simulator is inserted into the spinal canal.          This is similar to a pacemaker (with a battery and a computer), with an electrical wire that zaps the region where the patient complains of pain.          The idea here is that the electrical stimulation overloads the nervous system so that the pain signals don’t reach the brain.                    Intrathecal Pump                   Another medical device, which is used to deliver medications directly into the space between the spinal cord and its protective sheath (theca = sheath).          Usually used to deliver high doses of analgesics than would be tolerated normally when injected systemically.                      What are the indications for these therapies?          Spinal Cord Stimulation:                  Failed Back Surgery Syndrome          Arachnoiditis with Radiculopathy          Complex Regional Pain Syndome          Peripheral Ischemic Neuropathy          Intractable Angina                    Intrathecal Pump:                  Outside of the context of low back pain, these are often used for patients with spasticity.          In the context of LBP, this is used for:                          Severe Osteoporosis              Somatic Back Pain without a neuropathic element              Lower extremity cancer pain                                            What is the evidence for these therapies?          Spinal Cord Stimulation:                  The evidence for failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome is strong for short term relief and moderate for long term relief.                    Intrathecal Pump:                  The evidence for implantable intrathecal infusion systems is strong for short term improvement in pain of malignancy or neuropathic pain.          The evidence is moderate for long term management of chronic pain.

Effectiveness of a large variety of therapeutic interventions used to manage chronic back pain has not been demonstrated conclusively.  There is increasing evidence supporting the use of interventional techniques in managing spinal pain.  Interventional techniques should be provided in the context of comprehensive chronic pain management.          In other words, don’t forget your physical and cognitive therapy!

	{"title": "Imaging with Low Back Pain &amp; Radiculopathy", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Learn about common causes of low back pain and radiculopathy.          Radiculopathy → nerve root damage (due to any cause).        Identify red flags for less common causes of LBP requiring urgent care.  Discuss rational management strategies.  Objective      Learn about common causes of low back pain and radiculopathy.    Causes of low back pain can be classified by their anatomic location, or by their etiology:          Anatomic Location → cord, nerves, meninges, spinal arteries/veins, bony spine, discs, retroperitoneum, paravertebral soft tissues.      Etiology → (VITAMIN-C); Vascular, Infectious, Trauma, Autoimmune, Metabolic, Iatrogenic, Neoplastic, Congenital, etc.        Objective      Identify red flags for less common causes of LBP requiring urgent care.    As mentioned in the previous lecture, these are signs of:          Cancer or Infection.      Spinal Fracture.      Cauda Equina or Progressive Neurologic Deficits.        Cancer or Infection:          Age &gt;50 or &lt;20 y/o.                  Recall that &gt;50 increases likelihood of cancer; &lt;20 increases likelihood of infection.                    Past history of Cancer.      Unexplained weightloss, fever, chills.      Immunosuppression.      UTIs, IVDU.      Back pain not improved with rest, or night pain.        Spinal Fracture:          Previous trauma.      Steroid use (weakens bones).      Age &gt;70 years.        Cauda Equina Syndrome (or severe neurologic compromise):          Bowel dysfunction.      Bladder dysfunction.      Saddle anesthesia.      Erectile dysfunction.        Objective      Discuss rational management strategies.    MRI is the best diagnostic test for low back pain ($$$):          CTs ($$) are sometimes used as a complement to an MRI because they can show the bones better.      X-Rays ($) are used more as a screening tool, since they’re only really effective at showing the bones.        However, routine imaging does not improve patient outcomes.          In other words, not every patient who reports back pain needs to have imaging done!                  This is especially true since in 85% of cases, no specific diagnosis is made, and 90% of patients will improve without treatment.                    Routine imaging has some negative consequences as well:                  Accuracy:                          Imaging will often result in false positives; it cannot distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic findings.              Imaging will also often have false negatives; the spine is a dynamic structure, so the cause may not be present at the time of imaging.                                Cost → imaging is expensive, has psychological consequences, and exposes patients to radiation and other risks.          Utility                           Oftentimes, the medical management remains the same, regardless of the cause.              Why image all patients when the end treatment is the same?                                            When should imaging (MRI) be done then?          Generally, when red flags are present, as listed above.                  For more specific referral guidelines, see the Canadian Association of Radiologists Guidelines for the Spine.                    Management should be geared towards ruling out red flag causes (tumour, infection, fracture, cauda equina, progressive neurologic compromise), and aiming for conservative management otherwise.      Low Back Pain CasesCase #1  Case Summary      45 yo M    Low Back Pain x years    3 weeks pain radiating down right leg    Would you image this patient?          Yes → although this isn’t a red flag per se, the fact that his back pain has suddenly changed suggests that imaging would be helpful.      From the history, it suggests that this is a radiculopathy.      Since he doesn’t direclty meet the red flag criteria, an MRI does not need to be done urgently.        Imaging revealed a disc herniation, as seen below:          Note that T1 shows CSF as dark, and T2 shows CSF as bright.      This was a herniation of a lumbar disc.        What is the natural history of a lumbar disc herniation?          90% of patients with a lumbar disc herniation (even with radiculopathy) resolve in 6 weeks; however 5% will have recurrent disc herniation.      Conservative treatment is preferred (NSAIDs, PT, bed rest, epidural steroid injections may help).      Surgery can be done in some causes, but although it has a &gt;90% success rate, there’s a 5% risk of ‘failed back’ syndrome.      Failed Back Syndrome → where back pain persists after surgery.                    Causes are manifold, including recurrent disc herniation, arachnoiditis, infection, and an incorrect initial diagnosis.          One important cause is an epidural scar due to surgery, because it can easily be picked up on imaging (seen on the right).                    Case #2  Case Summary      79 yo M.    Back and leg pain with walking, relieved with sitting.    Imaging revealed lumbar spinal stenosis, as seen below:          Recall that this was a narrowing of the vertebral canal.      This results in neurogenic claudication when the spine is extended, which narrows the vertebral canal.      Hence, the patient has pain with walking (extending the spine), and it’s relieved with flexion.      As mentioned before, neurogenic claudication (caused by spinal stenosis) is different from vascular claudication: in one, the pain with walking is due to nerve compression; in the other, it’s due to vascular insufficiency.      Surgery can be done to decompress the canal.      Here, note that the thickening of the ligamentum flavum, posterior bulging of the disc, and inflammation of the facet joints results in narrowing of the vertebral canal.Case #3  Case Summary      21 yo M, varsity athlete    2 years of LBP    Would you image this patient?          Yes; the patient was &lt;20 when the back pain started.      Since he’s an athlete, he also undoubtedly has a past Hx of trauma.        Imaging revealed Spondylolysis, as seen below:          Recall that spondylolysis = fracture of the pars interarticularis.                  Fairly common: seen in 5-7% of the general population, and 22-44% of competitive athletes (!).                    Since the vertebrae is now no longer connected via the facet joint, it can easily slip out → spondylolisthesis.        How is Spondylolysis treated?          Conservative treatment, especially if the fracture only occurs in one site.      If spondylolysis proceeds to progressive spondylolisthesis (ie. the disc starts to slip), then surgical stabilization needs to be done.      Note the obvious fracture of the pars interarticularis. However, no slippage of the vertebrae has occured yet, ie. there's no spondylolisthesis.  When imaging the lumbar spine obliquely, the posterior elements of the vertebrae form a Scottie Dog (see below)          Scottie dog → ie, a Scottish Terrier.      The transverse process is the nose.      The pedicle forms the eye.      The inferior articular facet is the front leg.      The superior articular facet is the ear.      The pars interarticularis (the part of the lamina between the two facets) is the neck.        Hence, when there’s spondylolysis, it looks like there’s a collar around the scottie dog’s neck          This could also be a decapitated scottie dog, if you’re of the macabre persuasion.        Remember      Spondylolysis (fracture of the pars interarticularis) results in a collared ‘Scottie Dog Sign’  Case #4  Case Summary      79 yo F.    Fell off chair 2 weeks ago.    Low Back Pain.    Would you image this patient?          Yes; she’s &gt;50, so you worry about a tumour or a fracture.        Imaging revealed the following:          Here, the T2 image was ‘fat suppressed’, where the fat brightness is suppressed.      Where is the abnormality here?                  Definitely L2, which has lost height and is pushing into the vertebral canal.          Also T12, where there’s some signal change at the top of the vertebral body (hyperintense on T2; hypointense on T1).                    Here, the compression of the vertebral canal at L2 is less significant than the signal change at T12 (which is much more suggestive of something insidious).        You have to differentiate this signal change as either osteoporotic changes or metastases:          Methods to differentiate the two won’t be tested.      However, it’s important to note that you have to rule out cancer when you see a signal change.        In this case, this was an Osteoporotic Compression Fracture:          These heal well in young patients, although there’s an increased incidence of future disc degeneration      In osteoporotic patients, this may progress.      Management is usually conservative.      Vertebroplasty can be done for severe persistent pain:                  Vertebroplasty → injection of bone cement into the collapsed vertebral body.          Thought to be a great, non-invasive approach to improve symptoms in these patients (no need to open up the back).          However, studies have shown that the effect of this procedure is largely due to a placebo effect.                          In a sham-controlled study, where control patients just received an injection of local anesthesia, there was a comparable improvement in symptoms!                                More recent observational studies suggest that there may still be a benefit in some cases, but vertebroplasty remains very controversial.                    Case #5  Case Summary      89 yo F.    fall on ice.    severe LBP, bedridden.    Imaging revealed a sacral insufficiency fracture, as shown below:          Insufficiency fractures are a type of stress fracture, which are the result of normal stresses on abnormal bone.      Hence, these are often seen with osteoporotic patients, with weakened bones.        A Nuclear Medicine Bone Scan can reveal a Honda Sign when there’s a sacral insufficiency fracture:          These bone scans (Bone Scintigraphy) involves using a radioisotope that localizes to regions of bone turnover.      The more active the bone turnover (eg, at a fracture), the more radioactive material will be seen.      With a sacral insufficiency fracture, the break will form an ‘H’, resulting in a Honda Sign (since it looks like the Honda logo), also known as an H-Sign.         Similar to vertebroplasty with an osteoporotic compression fracture, sacroplasty can be done with a sacral fracture:          Sacroplasty involves inserting two needles at an angle into the sacrum (sort of like two crossed lightsabers), to inject bone cement.      This helps stabilize the sacrum in a similar fashion to vertebroplasty.      Case #6  Case Summary      47 y/o F.    Low back pain x 12 months.    Occasional pain down both legs.    Should this person be imaged?          Probably not; no red flag features.      This would change if she had been treated conservatively, and hadn’t been responding to it.      In this case, an X-ray was done as a cheap and quick screening test, since it had been going on for a while.        A spine X-ray was done, revealing the following:            Is there anything peculiar here?      Note that the posterior part of the L2 vertebral body is caved in! (look at the margins of each vertebral body)      This suggests that there’s something pushing on the body from within the vertebral canal.      Since something was found on X-ray, an MRI was then ordered on the patient.        Imaging revealed a mass in the vertebral cord, as shown below          Note that it’s pressing on the L2 vertebrae, and it’s well circumscribed.      Imaging characteristics and the patient history (slow growing, well circumscribed, etc) suggested that this was a meningioma.        What are features of a Meningioma?          Meningioma → slow growing, benign tumour. It compresses, but does not invade.      Arises from the arachnoid.      Excellent prognosis with a complete excision (which is possible in &gt;95% of cases).      Adjunctive radiation is done if the tumour cannot completely be excised, or the tumour is aggressive.      Case #7  Case Summary      67 yo F.    Low Back Pain x 6 weeks.    Patient had constitutional symptoms.    Would you image this patient?          Yes; the patient is &gt;50, and had constitutional symptoms.      A screening X-ray revealed an abnormality at the level of L2/L3 (seen to the right).      Since there was an abnormal finding, the patient then proceeded to have an MRI.        An MRI revealed the following          Abnormal tissue, damage to the vertebral endplates, compression of the vertebral canal, and involvement of the intervertebral discs.      This is classic for osteomyelitis-discitis.        What are features of Osteomyelitis-Discitis?          Osteomyelitis → infection/inflammation of the bone or bone marrow.      Discitis → infection/inflammation in the intervertebral disc space.      Most commonly caused by Staph. aureus.                  E.coli is the most common Gram Negative cause.          Additionally, Salmonella is possible in patients with sickle cell, and TB is possible in patients with foreign travel.

	{"title": "Approach to Low Back Pain", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Recognize and identify common low back problems.  Develop an approach to treatment for low back pain.  Understand when to order tests and which ones.  Understand prognosis for different low back problems.  Know red flags and their signficance.Review of Spinal Anatomy  The spine is comprised of vertebral bodies, separated by intervertebral discs.  Adjacent vertebrae are attached to one another by facet joints.  The intervertebral discs are composed of an outer annulus and an inner nucleus.          The outer annulus is more fibrous; the inner nucleus is gel like.      Recall that the inner nucleus was a remnant of the notochord.        With a disc herniation, the outside annulus tears, leading to extravasation of the inner nuclear ‘gel’  Objective      Develop an approach to treatment for low back pain.  The Lower Back Pain History  85% will have no specific diagnosis; however most will get better within 1 month.  In general, the history is the most important part in determining a diagnosis with lower back pain.  Some things that you should assess on history include:          Pain → OPQRST      Weakness      Numbness/Tingling      Incoordination        Pain:          Pain that is dull/aching is more suggestive of muscle causes.      Pain that is throbbing can suggest nerve/muscle causes.      Sharp pain might suggest a fracture.      Burning/numbing/tingling pain suggests a nerve-related cause.        Weakness:          Suggests a nerve/muscle/tendon problem.      Determine what is week, and what structures are around the weak area.        Numbness/Tingling:          Numbness (ie. a loss of sensation) is always nerve related.      Tingling (ie. a ‘stinging sensation’) can be muscle related, or nerve related.        Incoordination:          Suggestive of a nerve/muscle problem.      Look at structures in the surrounding area.      The Physical Exam  The physical exam should be used to corroborate the story heard on history, and to rule out red flags.  Should only contribute 5% to the diagnosis; the history is by far the most important.  Tests are for motor, sensory, reflexes, gait, etc.  Objective      Know red flags and their signficance.    Red flags correspond to a few serious issues we worry about:          Infection      Tumours      Cauda Equina      Progressive Neurologic Deficits.        Red flags on history:          Age of the patient:                  &lt;20 or &gt;50.          Tumours are more likely in older patients; infections are more likely in younger patients.          When you see a patient in these ranges, suspect non-muscle/ligament pain.                    History of cancer → increases likelihood that pain is related to cancer mets.      Weight loss, night or rest pain                  Increases likelihood that this is cancer/infection related.                    Immunosuppresion, IV drug use, recent infection, fever, chills.                  Increases likelihood that this is infection related.                    Trauma → increases likelihood of fracture.      Bowel, bladder, saddle anesthesia, erectile dysfunction                  Suggestive signs of cauda equina.          Extremely important, because injury to cauda equina generally does not heal well, unlike other causes of back pain.          Patients with cauda equina syndrome will have long-lasting complications unless treated immediately!                      Yellow flags:          Yellow flags will affect complaince or patient response to back pain.      They include psychosocial factors like work status, litigation, depression, narcotic overuse, and the duration of symptoms.        Objective      Recognize and identify common low back problems.    The low back problems that will be discussed are as follows:          Tumour      Disc Herniation      Mechanical Causes (Stenosis, Spondylosis, Spondylolysis, Spondylolisthesis)      Tumour  Here, back pain is often associated with weight loss.  The most common tumour of the spine is metastases.          Spinal mets are actually seen in 10% of cancer patients.      The most common cancers that spread to the spine are prostate, breast, and lung cancers.        Metastases most commonly spread to the vertebral bodies, and generally don’t penetrate the spinal cord (97% are extradural).          Mets are spread to the spine via emboli through the blood stream.        Presentation:          Progressive pain, during rest and/or sleep.      Systemic symptoms (eg. unexplained weight loss).      Neurologic involvement: 76% of patients will be weak at the time of diagnosis.        Diagnosis:          MRI is best for visualization.      X-rays are non-sensitive; they’re usually only effective for fractures, or things specfic to the bone.      Bone scans can be used to look for regions of inflammation.                  Not useful generally, except for blastic types of tumours.                      Treatment:          Supportive → pain relief, preservation of neurologic function, preservation of spinal stability      Disc Herniation  Recall from Anatomy of the Spine that disc herniations most commonly occur in lordotic regions of the spine (ie. cervical/lumbar regions).          Hence, the most common levels for disc herniation are C5-6 and L5-S1.        Typically disc herniation is asymptomatic:          Disk herniation is a normal phenomenon in patients over the age of 45; it’s not worrisome unless it’s causing pain.      In one experiment, the entire US Olympic gymnastics team had their spine imaged. Everyone had disc herniation; none had back pain.        Symptoms will occur due to compression of the surrounding structures by the nucleus pulposus.          Recall that compression of the ligament will present with localized pain, while compression of a spinal nerve will result in radiation and neurologic features.        Diagnosis:          Most commonly from clinical history.                  Since posterior/posterolateral herniations are most common, pain will often be worse with flexion (which stretches the posterior spine), and better with extension (lying down, standing).                    EMG (electromyography), MRI, can also be done.        Treatment          Most disc herniations will resolve with conservative treatment:                  This applies even if the herniation pushes on the nerve!          Conservative treatment would include PT, exercise, avoiding certain postures, NSAIDs.                    The natural history is for improvement over 6 months - 2 years without surgery.                  Surgery is only done if the pain is progressive, neurologic signs are worsening, or if the patient needs to recover quickly for personal/professional reasons.          Another reason is if there Cauda Equina Syndrome, which will not resolve with conservative Tx.          Surgical options include disc replacement (if young, healthy, and one level involvement), or a partial discectomy.                    Surgery doesn’t improve outcomes; it just gets you there faster.        Cauda Equina Syndrome:          Compression of S2,3,4, which, as we recall, includes the pudendal nerve.      Hence, this results in bowel/bladder involvement, numbness around the perinanal region (saddle anesthesia), and erectile dysfunction.                  Recall that these were the red flags we discussed previously.                    Cauda Equina is a medical emergency → as mentioned before, these nerves don’t recover well conservatively, unlike with other herniations.        Classic Features of Cauda Equina      Bowel problems.    Bladder problems.    Saddle Anesthesia.    Erectile Dysfunction.  Lumbar Stenosis  Stenosis = narrowing of an area.  Lumbar stenosis = narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal or intervertebral foramen below a critical level, resulting in nerve compression.          Can be due to disc herniation, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, or osteophyte formation.        Presentation:          Pain, typically in the back and legs.                  Worse with extension, but better with flexion (the ‘shopping cart sign’, because flexing forward to push a shopping cart alleviates pain).          This is because extension narrows the vertebral canal, exacerbating the stenotic area.                    Numbness, tingling, and weakness are also possible signs, which may be present on physical exam.        Remember      Disc Herniation will be worse with flexion, and better with extension.              Since flexion stretches the posterior side of the spine, where most herniations occur.              Lumbar Stenosis will be worse with extension, and better with flexion.              Since extension narrows the vertebral canal, exacerbating the stenosis.              Leg pain with walking may be due to a neurogenic or a vascular cause:          Neurogenic → lumbar spinal stenosis.      Vascular → ie. claudication due to circulatory insufficiency.      Leg pain from either condition will go away with rest, but with spinal stenosis the patient usually has to sit down for a few minutes to ease the leg and often low back pain, whereas leg pain from vascular claudication will go away if the patient simply stops walking.        Cervical vs Lumbar Stenosis          Stenosis of the vertebral canal will present differently depending on whether it’s pinched in the cervical region or in the lumbar region.                  Cervical Stenosis results in an upper motor neuron problem.          Lumbar Stenosis results in a lower motor neuron problem.                    Recall that:                   Upper motor neuron = brain &amp; spinal cord.          Lower motor neuron = nerve roots (ie. once they leave the spinal cord).                    This makes it easy to remember that lumbar stenosis is a lower motor neuron problem; since the spinal cord ends at L1/L2, any narrowing beyond this point will be outside the spinal cord (and hence LMN).      Knowing this is important in making a diagnosis:                  Upper motor neuron problems will result in hyperreflexia and spasms.          Lower motor neuron problems will result in the opposite: atrophy, muscle weakness, etc.                      Remember      Cervical Stenosis results in an upper motor neuron problem.    Lumbar Stenosis results in a lower motor neuron problem.  Spondylosis, Spondylolysis, Spondylolisthesis  These 3 terms sound similar, but mean different things (very confusing):          Spondylosis → degenerative changes of the spine.      Spondylolysis → fracture of the pars interarticularis.                  Pars interarticularis = the connection between the two facets of the facet joint (the superior and inferior articular facets).                    Spondylolisthesis → slippage of vertebrae relative to adjacent one, usually due to a pars interarticularis fracture (spondylolysis).        Spondylosis vs. Spondylolysis vs. Spondylolisthesis      Spondylosis → degenerative changes of the spine.    Spondylolysis → fracture of the pars interarticularis.    Spondylolisthesis → slippage of one vertebrae relative to another, typically due to spondylolysis.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Spine", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe normal curvatures of the spine.  Identify the key features of vertebral column and compare various views of radiographic images.  Identify and describe the joints and ligaments of the vertebral column, including the intervertebral discs, zygopophyseal, sacroiliac joint.  List the muscles that support the back.  Describe the Spinal Cord in Relation to the Vertebral Column and the clinical significance.Spinal Anatomy  The vertebral column is made up of a curved series of bones, called vertebrae.  These vertebrae are classified as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, or coccygeal.  The number of vertebrae in each is as follows:          Cervical → 7 vertebrae.      Thoracic → 12 vertebrae.      Lumbar → 5 vertebrae.      Sacral → 5 vertebrae.      Coccygeal → 2-4 vertebrae (this varies since this is a vestigial structure).        As we saw long ago in ITM, one easy way to remember this is the times at which you’d eat breakfast (7), lunch (12), and dinner (5).  The total number of vertebrae is usually 33.          The sacral vertebrae are fused to form the sacrum.      The coccygeal vertebrae are fused to form the coccyx, aka. the tailbone.        The vertebral canal, which houses and protects the spinal cord, runs through the vertebral foramen of each vertebrae.  Note that as we go cranially to caudally, the intervertebral discs get thicker. This allows the lower spine to support more weight.  In addition, there are some key vertebrae that have some specific names:            C1 → aka. the atlas.                  This is the bone that supports the head, hence it’s known as the ‘atlas’.          Note that C1 does not have a body; it’s shaped like a ring for the head to balance on top of.                    C2 → aka. the axis.                  C2 projects into the atlas, and facilitates its rotation. Hence, it’s referred to as the ‘axis’, since it acts as an axis of rotation.          Its projection (which sticks through into C1 like a finger through a ring), is called the odontoid process, or the dens/peg.                    C7 → aka. the vertebra prominens.                  C7 is known as the ‘vertebra prominens’ because its spinous process is longer and more prominent than with the other spinous processes.          Hence it’s used as a landmark when examining the head and neck (it’s the first ‘big bump’ you feel when you palpate the bones of your spine from behind).          It’s difficult to feel the spinous processes above C7 because they’re smaller, and there’s a ligament in front of them (the ligamentum nuchae).                    Normal Curvatures of the Spine  During development, the entire spine is ‘C’ shaped and kyphotic (see right).  Hence, any curvature of the spine that is kyphotic is referred to as a primary curvature, since it mirrors the embryonic curvature, and was present before birth.  Any lordotic curvature of the spine is dissimilar from the embryologic curvature, and is hence referred to as a secondary curvature.  Hence, we have a:            Secondary cervical curve (ie. cervical lordosis).      Primary thoracic curve (ie. thoracic kyphosis).      Secondary lumbar curve (ie. lumbar lordosis).      Primary sacral curve (ie. sacral kyphosis).        The secondary curvatures arise after birth:          The secondary cervical curve arises when the baby begins to hold up its head.      The secondary lumbar curve arises when the baby begins to walk.        In women, the lordotic lumbar curve is more prominent (hence it seems like women ‘stick out their butt more’).  Clinically, kyphosis, lordosis, and scoliosis also refer to excessive curvatures of the spine:          Kyphosis = excessive thoracic kyphosis (ie. a hunchback).      Lordosis = excessive lumbar lordosis.      Scoliosis = lateral curvature (ie. in the coronal plane).      Features of the Spinal Vertebra  There is a solid body, which is what lies above/below the intervertebral discs.          The shape of the body differs depending on the level of the vertebrae: thoracic vertebrae have a heart shaped body; lumbar vertebrae have a kidney shaped body.      To remember this, just picture the organs in each region (the heart is thoracic, the kidneys are lumbar).        From this body extends two stems called pedicles.  At the end of these pedicles are transverse processes that stick outwards.          These transverse processes are thick in the thoracic region, where the ribs need to attach to them.      They become slender in the lumbar region, where the muscles attach.        From this, two projections then come together medially and connect to form a spinous process. This is what ‘sticks out of your back’.  The bone that comes from the pedicles to the spinous process is flattened; hence it’s called the lamina.  The hole bordered by the pedicles and the lamina is where the spinal cord will run through; this hole is called the vertebral foramen.          Together, all of the vertebral foramen form the vertebral canal.        In addition, there are 2 processes that extend upwards and 2 processes that extend downwards from each vertebrae; these are known as superior articular processes and inferior articular processes respectively.          The inferior articular processes connect with the superior articular processes of the vertebrae immediately below the current one.      Where they join, they form a facet joint (aka. a zygapophysial joint). This is circled in red above.      This is a synovial joint that guides and restricts lateral rotation (from side to side). Note that the facet joints are not built for weight bearing.        Between the body of each vertebrae is an intervertebral disc.  How many processes extend from each vertebrae?          We have 2 transverse processes that project to the side.      We have 1 spinous process that projects posteriorly.      We have 2 superior articular processes that project up.      We have 2 inferior articular processes that project down.      In other words, there are 7 processes that extend from each vertebrae.      Above is a CT scan (left) and an X-ray (right) of the spine. Note that the spinal cord lies between the vertebral bodies and the spinous processes.Ligaments of the Spine  There are 5 major ligaments that you need to know about:          Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL):                  As given by the name, this lies anterior to the vertebral bodies.          This is a tough ligament, because it needs to oppose the anterior push of the vertebrae (there are important structures anteriorly).                    Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL):                  This lies just posterior to the vertebral bodies.          This is a weaker ligament than the ALL, and is actually somewhat fused to the vertebral bodies.          Note that this does not lie posterior to the vertebrae themselves; rather it lies just behind the vertebral bodies, on the anterior side of the vertebral foramen.                    Ligamentum Flavum                  This is particularly important, because it’s the strongest ligament in the spine. It helps protect elements in the canal.          Flavum = yellow, so just like its name implies, this ligament is yellow. The yellow coloration is because this is composed of fibrocartilage.          This lies on the posterior side of the vertebral foramen.          In other words, the vertebral foramen is covered by the PLL in the front, and the ligamentum flavum in the back.                    Interspinous Ligament                  As the name implies, this ligament wraps between the spinous processes of the spinal vertebrae.          This is fairly flexible, in order to allow for the flexion and rotation of the spine.                    Supraspinous Ligament                  Just as the name suggests, this wraps over the spinous processes, and is hence the most posterior ligament of the spine.          Since this wraps outside the spinous processes, it’s less flexible than the interspinous ligament.                      This also corresponds to the position of the ligaments anteriorly to posteriorly, ie:          ALL → PLL → ligamentum flavum → interspinous → supraspinous.      This can be better seen in the figure below.        When would you pierce these ligaments clinically?          You would pierce the posterior ligaments (supraspinous, interspinous, ligamentum flavum) if you were performing a spinal tap or epidural.      Why is this a safe spot to inject anesthetic?       Recall that in the vertebral canal, we also have blood vessels. However, most of these blood vessels are present anteriorly, so a posterior approach reduces the risk of bleeding.      Also, we inject anesthetic at the level of L4 (the PSIS), which is below the conus medullaris. Hence, we avoid the spinal cord and instead inject between fibres of the cauda equina.      The Intervertebral Discs  The intervertebral discs are comprised of an fibrous outer layer and a soft inner layer.          The fibrous outer layer is referred to as the annulus fibrosus.      The soft, gelatinous inner layer is referred to as the nucleus pulposus.        These have different origins embryologically:          Recall that the notochord develops into the neural tube.      The vertebral column develops around the neural tube.      As this happens, the notochord actually gets absorbed into the vertebral column, and becomes the nucleus pulposus.        Remember      The nucleus pulposus (inner layer of the intervertebral discs) is the remnant of the notochord.    There’s no blood supply feeding the intervertebral discs, so how do they get nutrients?          They obtain nutrients from the surrounding vessels, through a neat mechanism.      In a loaded state (seated/standing), the intervertebral discs are compressed, forcing H2O molecules out. This water is absorbed by surrounding capillaries.      In an unloaded state (lying down), this fluid (supplemented with nutrients), gushes back into the discs.      This transmission of fluid in and out of the discs also explains why you’re taller with some rest. 25% of the vertebral length is accounted for by the discs, so any change in this thickness can have a noticeable impact on height.        A herniated disc occurs when there’s a tear in the outer layer of the disc, allowing the nucleus pulposus to leak out.          This is most commonly a posterior or posterolateral herniation, because, as we recall the ligament behind the vertebral bodies (the PLL) is weaker than the one in front of the bodies (the ALL).      In addition, since the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine are lordotic, the posterior side of the disc is squished more tightly than the anterior side of the disc, making it more likely to tear.      Hence, cervical and lumbar posterior/posterolateral tears are the most common presentation.      Other names for a herniated disc include: (1) prolapsed disc, (2) ruptured disc and (3) slipped disc.        What clinical findings would you see with a lumbar herniated disc?          Posterior herniation                  Here, the nucleus pulposus presses against the posterior longitudinal ligament, leading to lumbago, aka. low back pain.          This pain is generally local to the back, because it’s caused by the irritation of pain fibres along the PLL.                    Posterolateral herniation.                  Here, the nucleus pulposus protrudes laterally to the PLL, and pushes against a spinal nerve root, leading to sciatica.          Impingement of the sciatic nerve causes pain that radiates to the buttocks, back of the thick, and lateral leg and foot (where the sciatic nerve innervates).          Here, you can do nerve specific tests, to determine the level of the herniation.                    This video is a great review of the differences between the two.        Posterior vs Posterolateral Herniation                             Posterior Herniation        Posterolateral Herniation                            Irritates the:        Posterior Longitudinal Ligament        Spinal nerve root                    Pain characteristics        Local to back        Radiates                    May cause (in lumbar region):        Lumbago        Sciatica            Features of the Cervical Vertebrae  There are some key differences between the cervical vertebrae and vertebrae in other regions.  As mentioned before, you can’t feel the spinous processes above C7, because of the presence of a thick ligament called the ligamentum nuchae.  In addition, there is no intervertebral disc between C1 and C2.  In the C3-C6 vertebrae, the edges of the vertebral bodies push out and form uncinate processes (circled in red above).          Furthermore, the intervertebral discs don’t extend to the very edge of the vertebral bodies here, so a fluid-filled space is formed.      The coupling of this space with the uncinate processes becomes the uncovertebral joints (of Lushka).      This becomes important as you age, because osteophytes commonly form here, leading to uncovertebral osteoarthritis.        These changes may accompany the osteoarthritic changes seen in ankylosing spondylitis and be a cause of chronic neck pain.      In addition, the osteophytes can cause a progressive narrowing of the intervertebral foramen where the spinal nerves and vertebral arteries come out. This can lead to compressive symptoms.      Note that the vertebral foramen is not the same as the intervertebral foramen; the latter is shown to the right, and is bordered by the pedicles and the back of the spinous processes.      Surface Anatomy of the Back  Key surface landmarks include:          Erector spinae → longitudinal muscles on either side of the spine, that keep the back erect.      Posterior Superior Iliac Spine → usually a ‘dimple’ on the back, that aligns to the level of L4/L5. Used to landmark where an epidural/spinal goes.      Extrinsic Muscles of the Back  The most superficial muscles of the back include:          Trapezius → comes off the occipital bone, and covers C1-T12.                  Nerve Supply → CN XI (Spinal Accessory Nerve), and branches from the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves.          Actions → depends on the part. The trapezius has a superior, transverse, and inferior region, which raises, retracts, and depresses the scapula respectively.                    Latissiumus dorsi → merges at the thoracolumbar fascia (the deep fascia of the back).                  Nerve Supply → thoracodorsal nerve.          Actions → adducts and medially rotates the humerus (eg. when you’re doing a pullup).                    Teres major → nicknamed the ‘minor lats’, or baby lats. Functionally similar to the latissimus dorsi.      Deltoid → forms the contours of the shoulder. Attaches to the scapula.        Below (on the right), the trapezius has been removed to reveal deeper muscles.          Here we see the rhomboid minor and rhomboid major muscles, which attach to the medial margin of the scapula.      Above this, we also see the levator scapula, which attaches to the superior angle of the scapula, and, as the name suggests, lifts the scapula.      All 3 of these muscles help retract and keep the scapula close to the vertebral column.      Frop top to bottom, the muscles attach to the scapula as follows:                  Levator scapulae → rhomboid minor → rhomboid major.          These attach to the medial margin of the scapula (1) above the spine of the scapula, (2) at the spine of scapula, and (3) below the spine of scapula respectively.                      Unlabeled on the above image, are the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.           These are the muscles that cover the scapula, and lie above and below the spine of the scapular respectively.      They attach to the greater tubercle of the humerus.      Extrinsic Muscles of the Back                   Origin      Insertion      Action      Innervation                  Trapezius      External occipital protuberance; nuchal ligament and spinous processes of C7-T12      Lateral 1/3 of clavicle, acromion and spine of scapula      Elevates, retracts and rotates scapula; superior fibers elevate, medial fibers retract and inferior fibers depress scapula.      Spinal root of accessory nerve (CN XI and C3, C4)              Latissimus Dorsi      Thoracolumbar fascia      Middle of the bicipital groove of the humerus      Adducts and medially rotates humerus      Thoracodorsal nerve              Levator Scapulae      Transverse processes of C1-C4      Medial scapula above the level of the spine of scapula      Raises the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)              Rhomboid Minor      Spinous processes of C7-T1      Medial scapula at the level of the spine of scapula      Retracts the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)              Rhomboid Major      Spinous processes of T2-T5      Medial scapula below the level of the spine of scapula      Depresses the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)      	All of these muscles are innervated by branches of the brachial plexus except for the trapezius	The trapezius is supplied by the spinal accessory nerve, ie. cranial nerve XIIntrinsic Muscles of the Back  The intrinsic muscles of the back affect the vertebral column.  Intrinsic muscles of the back include:          Splenius cervicus → looks like a ‘band-aid’ around the neck; helps keep it upright.      Erector spinae → as mentioned before, this is a long muscle that helps keep the spine upright. However, it’s actually comprised of 3 groups:                  Ileocostalis → has fibres that extend and attach to the ribs (see below)          Longissiumus → longitudinal band of muscle.          Spinalis → closest to the spine.                    To remember the branches of the erector spinae, laterally to medially, remember I LIKE STANDING (ileocostalis, longissimus, spinalis).        What is the innervation of the erector spinae muscles?          This is fairly intuitive: the dorsal rami of the spinal nerves.      If you visualize where the muscles are (right beside and behind the spine), it makes sense that the dorsal rami innervate them!        Remember      The muscles of the erector spinae include:              Ileocostalis        Longissimus        Spinalis              Remember these as I LIKE STANDING.    Deep to the erector spinae, and directly adjacent to the spinal vertebrae, are a group of muscles called transverso-spinalis group of muscles (circled below).          These muscles run obliquely between the transverse processes and spinous processes of the vertebrae.      They help maintain the upright posture and extension of the vertebral column.      As with the erector spinae, these are innervated by the dorsal rami.      The Spinal Cord  The spinal cord originates as an extension of the medulla oblongata in the brainstem, and exits through the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal.  However, the spinal cord does not travel all the way down the vertebral canal; it actually stops at the level of L1/L2.          At this point, the spinal cord tapers into a cone-shaped structure called the conus medullaris.      The space between L1/L2 (where the spinal cord ends), and S2 (where the vertebral canal ends) is referred to as the lumbar cistern.      In the lumbar cistern, the roots of the lumbar and sacral spinal nerves fan outwards, to form the cauda equina (horse’s tail).        Why does the spinal cord end before the vertebral canal does?          Embryologically, the spinal cord continued to the end of the vertebral canal, at S2.      However, as the embryo develops, the vertebral column grows faster relative to the spinal cord.      Hence, just like with the kidneys, this is a ‘relative ascent’.        When a lumbar puncture is done, it’s done at the level of the PSIS (L4/L5). This is because the needle will then enter the lumbar cistern, where it is less likely to puncture something.  Wrapping the entire spinal cord is the meninges, which comprise of the:          Dura mater (dural sac).      Arachnoid mater.      Pia mater → directly envelops the spinal cord and brain.        Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the cerebrospinal fluid, ie. in the subarachnoid space.  Hence, the dura and arachnoid mater lie outside the CSF, while the pia mater lies beneath the CSF. As a result, the outside lining of the spinal cord is often referred to as the dura-arachnoid.Spinal Nerve Roots  Note that there are 7 cervical vertebrae, but 8 cervical nerves:          So the C1 nerve lies above the C1 vertebrae, but C8 actually lies above the T1 vertebrae.      As a result, all of the lower nerves (thoracic, lumbar, sacral, etc) lie below their corresponding vertebrae.      That is, the L3 nerve lies below the L3 vertebrae, and so on and so forth.        Clinical Application:          If a disc herniation occurred between C5 and C6, then the C6 nerve would be affected, since it lies above the C6 vertebrae.      However, if a disc herniation occurred between L3 and L4, then the L3 nerve would be affected, since it lies below the L3 vertebrae.        Remember      Cervical nerves lie above their corresponding vertebrae.    All lower nerves lie below their corresponding vertebrae.    This is because there are 8 cervical nerves, but only 7 cervical vertebrae, resulting in an offset.    Key spinal nerve associations:          C1-C4 → Cervical Plexus.      C3,4,5 → Phrenic Nerve (C3,4,5 keeps your diaphragm alive).      C5-T1 → Brachial plexus (will be seeing this in gory detail soon).      T1-T12 → Intercostal Nerves.      L1-L4 → Lumbar Plexus.      L4-S3 → Sacral Plexus.      S2,3,4 → Pudendal Nerve.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/anatomy-spine.html"},
	{"title": "Approach to the Spine", "text": "Lecture Objectives  To introduce basic spine anatomy  To identify clinically relevant spine anatomy  – I.e. understand how anatomy is important to the assessment and diagnosis of spinal pathology.  To correlate spinal anatomy with clinical assessment and radiographic interpretation.Introduction  The spine is a commonly complained about area for patients, doctors, and students.  The spine is an anatomically complex region.  We’ll be focusing on the big picture, rather than the details:          “Learn the big things rather than the details; this is a generalization that holds good throughout the realm of medicine, and I advise you to evaporate your knowledge not to dryness but to a serviceable bulk. Larger structures, as a rule, are far more important than smaller ones, and moreover will act as guides or ‘rallying‐points’ in calling the latter to mind.” (S.E. Whitnall, 1933)      Anatomic Planes  As we saw in first year:          The sagittal plane splits the body into left and right.      The coronal (frontal) plane splits the body into front and back.      The transverse (axial) plane splits the body into top and bottom.      Spinal Surface Anatomy  The surface anatomy gives you clues as to what’s going on deeper in the body.  Important landmarks include          C7 = vertebral prominence.                  This is the vertebral bump at the base of your neck.          Useful in localizing an injury to a specific vertebral level.                    L4 = typically at the level of the PSIS                  PSIS = Posterior Superior Iliac Spine          Useful when doing spinal anesthesia (ie. an epidural).          When performing an epidural, the patient is also usually flexed (since that increases the space in the vertebral canal). We saw this with Pattern 4 back pain in Family Week.                    Spinal Anatomy  The spinal cord originates from the foramen magnum (the opening in the base of the skull), and tapers down to a cone-like structure called the conus medullaris at the level of L1.          Note that the spinal cord doesn’t go all the way down the vertebral canal; it actually stops at L1.      The remaining nerve roots actually project down past the cord, and fan out to form the cauda equina (the horse’s tail).      This is why the PSIS (at L4) is such a useful landmark; at that point, your needle will be below the spinal cord, so you’re less likely to puncture a nerve.        Remember      The spinal cord originates at the foramen magnum, and ends at the conus medullaris at the level of L1.    The remaining nerve roots then fan out to form the cauda equina.    Cauda Equina Syndrome → when there’s injury to the cauda equina (eg. via compression or trauma).          The most common cause of this is disk herniation.      Since the nerves in the cauda equina innervate the perineum, bladder, anal sphincters, and external genitalia, you end up with corresponding issues.        Dermatome vs Myotome:          Dermatome → the region on the skin that’s covered by a specific nerve root.      Myotome → the muscles that are innervated by a specific nerve root.      Although there’s overlap between the two, they are NOT the same.      Functions of the Spine  Structural support and balance for upright posture.  Protects the spinal cord and neural elements.  Allows for mobility.  To achieve these functions, the spine must be:          Resistant to axial loading forces.      Elastic        Resistance and elasticity are obtained from the alternating kyphotic (humped) and lordotic curves of the spine along the sagittal plane, by acting like a spring.  Kyphosis vs Lordosis      Kyphosis = curved forward. (Kypho- = humped).    Lordosis = curved backward. (Lordo- = curved).    Motion Segment → the functional unit of the spine.  Components of the motion segment include:          2 adjacent vertebrae.      1 intervertebral disc.      2 facet joints.        The motion segments are called ‘motion segments’ because they facilitate the movement of the spine (eg. flexion and extension).Bones and Ligaments of the SpineBones of the Spine  The spine is comprised of vertebrae.  For each vertebrae:           There is a solid body, which is what lies above/below the intervertebral discs.      From this body extends two projections called pedicles.      At the end of these pedicles are transverse processes that stick outwards.      From this, two projections then come together medially and connect to form a spinous process. This is what ‘sticks out of your back’.      The bone that comes from the pedicles to the spinous process is flattened; hence it’s called the lamina.      The gap between the pedicles and the lamina is where the spinal cord will run through; this hole is called the vertebral foramen.      Ligaments of the Spine  Ligament = between bone and bone.  Tendon = between bone and something else (muscle, eye, etc).  There are 5 major ligaments that you need to know about:          Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL):                  As given by the name, this lies anterior to the vertebral bodies.                    Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL):                  This lies just posterior to the vertebral bodies.          Note that this does not lie posterior to the vertebrae themselves; rather it lies just behind the vertebral bodies, on the anterior side of the vertebral foramen.                    Ligamentum Flavum                  This is particularly important, because it’s the strongest ligament in the spine. It helps protect elements in the canal.          Flavum = yellow, so just like its name implies, this ligament is yellow.          This lies on the posterior side of the vertebral foramen.          In other words, the vertebral foramen is covered by the PLL in the front, and the ligamentum flavum in the back.                    Interspinous Ligament                  As the name implies, this ligament wraps between the spinous processes of the spinal vertebrae.                    Supraspinous Ligament                  Just as the name suggests, this wraps over the spinous processes, and is hence the most posterior ligament of the spine.                      This also corresponds to the position of the ligaments anteriorly to posteriorly, ie:          ALL → PLL → ligamentum flavum → interspinous → supraspinous.      This can be better seen in the figure below.        Ligaments of the Spine      Anteriorly to posteriorly, we have the:              Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL)        Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL)        Ligamentum Flavum        Interspinous Ligament        Supraspinous Ligament            Case Presentation  On the top right is a c-spine X-ray of a patient that had a motor vehicle accident.  Note the loss of lordosis compared to the normal c-spine:          Mormally, the cervical spine is lordotic as shown on the left. On the right, note that there’s a relative kyphosis.      This suggests that there’s some injurious process going on.      Furthermore, there’s widening between the spinous processes, further suggesting injury.        The MRI on the right showed fluid entering the spinal column (note the white stuff on the right).          Note that the fluid is tracking from the posterior side of the neck to just outside the spinal cord.      That means that it must have gone through (1) supraspinous ligament and (2) interspinous ligament.      If the fluid had gone into the vertebral canal, then the ligamentum flavum would also have been damaged.      Aging of the Spine  Pain can arise from the joints, discs, nerve roots, or soft tissue of the spine.  As you age, degenerative changes in the spine can exacerbate or cause pain.  Degenerative changes in the spine (both normal and abnormal), include:            Degenerative disc → the discs, which are normally fluid filled, begin to dry out and become dessicated. This makes them less able to deal with weight bearing.      Bulged disc → the disc begins to stick out past the vertebral bodies.      Herniated disc → the gelatinous inner nucleus of the disc extravasates out of the fibrous outer layer.      Thinning disc → as the inner nucleus dries out, the disc becomes thinner.      Disc degeneration with osteophyte formation → as the spine becomes less stable, the vertebral bodies begin to form bone spurs called osteophytes.      Scoliosis  Scoliosis → lateral curvature of the spine &gt;10°.  This involves both a lateral curvature deformity and a rotational deformity.          That is, not only is the spine bent in the coronal plane, it’s also rotated about its axis.        This rotation can be assessed with something known as Adam’s Forward Bend Test:          To perform the test, you have the patient stand up, with their legs and hands together. You then have them bend forward with their head down.      With scoliosis, you’ll see a prominence on one side due to the rotation of the spine. (see image to the right).      In fact, the rotation of the spine actually causes a deformity of the chest wall.      This is why severe scoliosis can present with breathing difficulties!      Adolescent (Idiopathic) Scoliosis  The most common type of scoliosis.  Presentation          Girls &gt; boys, age &gt; 10 years      Presents as a painless curve in spine.        Etiology → not well understood.  Physical Exam          Coronal spinal curvature.      Rib/lumbar prominence (via Adam’s Forward Bend Test).      Rule out neurologic or associated conditions.                  If you have pain, neurologic symptoms, or rapidly progressive scoliosis, then this is atypical, and hence is a red flag.          Hence, these red flags would make an idiopathic scoliosis less likely, and point to an underlying cause (post-traumatic, tumour, or another anatomical cause).                      Treatment          Depends on patient age, growth remaining, progression of the scoliosis, &amp; severity of the curve.      Observation, bracing, surgery.

Describe the meaning of impairment, disability, and handicap.  Develop alternative approaches to forming the differential diagnosis in MSK disorders.  Integrate some common patterns for MSK disorders from the history into differential formation.  Objective      Learn the importance of history taking in musculoskeletal disorders.    Estimated 90% of the diagnosis is based on accurate history  Likely similar to other clinical areas  Need to form hypothesis on which to base:          Physical exam      Investigations      Treatments        Leads to efficient and effective practice.  Objective      Describe the meaning of impairment, disability, and handicap.    Impairment → ‘Any loss or abnormality of psyhological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function’ (WHO).          Functions at an organ level, ie. a problem involving structure or function (eg. torn achilles tendon).        Disability → ‘An activity limitation that creates a difficulty in the performance, accomplishment, or completion of an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being’ (WHO).          Functions at a person level, ie. failing to do a task or activity (eg. can’t walk up stairs).        Handicap → ‘A disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual (WHO).          Functions at a societal level, eg. unable to work as a bar manager.        Objective      Develop alternative approaches to forming the differential diagnosis in MSK disorders.    Integrate some common patterns for MSK disorders from the history into differential formation.    Some approaches include the following:          Inflammatory vs Degenerative.      Anatomic.      Pain characterization.      Presence of Weakness.      Abnormal Sensation.      Root or peripheral nerve cause.        Inflammatory vs Degenerative          Broadly speaking, MSK disorders can be classified as either inflammatory or degenerative.      Inflammatory disorders will present with pain at rest; degenerative disorders will present with pain with activity.        Degenerative vs Inflammatory Features                    Degenerative        Inflammatory                            Pain with activity        Pain at rest                    May report stiffness        Morning stiffness                    Locking        Swelling                    Instability        Warmth                    May have weakness        Rash                    Swelling? (secondary)        Malaise                             Fever / weight loss / constitutional symptoms              Anatomic          Differential may be highly anatomically based.      Use the ‘generic joint’ → what do all joints have in common?      Apply this to specific joint tissues → ligaments, muscles/tendons, nerves.      Note: # is shorthand for fracture.        Pain Characterization          Pain may be single most common spoken word in musculoskeletal medicine      There are various approaches to take the ‘pain history’ (eg. OPQRST). Another one is ‘OLD CARS’:                  Onset.          Location.          Duration.          Characteristics (quality, severity).          Aggrevating/alleviating.          Radiation.          Symptoms (elsewhere/related).                    Consider the below 4 patients, all presenting with R wrist pain. From the history, we can see that they have very different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis.          Scaphoid Fracture          Rheumatoid Arthritis.          Septic joint.                      Weakness          Weakness is an exceedingly common complaint when pain is involved → if it hurts, you don’t want to move it (hence you have weakness).      Difficulty 1 → is it weakness, or pain, or both?                  Pain without weakness is common.          Painless weakness limits the differential.                    Difficulty 2 → if it’s true weakness, what is causing it? (see possible structures below)        Below are 3 patients, each presenting with foot weakness. Again, they have different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  Tibialis anterior rupture.          Common peroneal neuropathy.          ACA stroke.                      Abnormal Sensation          Abnormal sensation suggests a peripheral nerve injury, which may result in paradoxical sensory changes:                  Increased/spontaneous sensation.          Diminished functional sensation.                    However, tingling and/or outright pain may have a number of causative tissue impairments (eg. nerve, muscle, tendon, bone/joint, referred, etc).      BUT true sensory loss is ALWAYS neurogenic → on P/E, you have to differentiate this from ‘numbness’, which is often vaguely defined by the patient.        Roots vs Peripheral Nerves          Consider the case of a ‘numb thumb’ (frequent tingles, diminished 2-pt discrimination).      Two things in the DDx should include:                  Carpal tunnel syndrome.          C6 Radiculopathy (root level pathology).                    So do we inject their risk, or MRI their neck?      Why are both of these in the differential?                  The C6 nerve root travels down the arm, and becomes the median nerve (which is involved in carpal tunnel syndrome).          The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the thumb, as well as motor innervation to the APB (Abductor Pollicis Brevis muscle at the base of the thumb).          The C6 nerve root also branches into the musculocutaneous nerve, which provides  motor innervation to the biceps.                    Hence, by looking at associated symptoms (eg. biceps weakness), you can help refine your diagnosis!          Root vs. Peripheral Nerve          Nerve roots are not the same as peripheral nerves!      These are similar but not the same; an important concept in MSK/nerve injury.      You must be able to differentiate:                   Dermatome from peripheral nerve territory.          Myotome from peripheral nerve territory.                    For instance, compare the region of innervation of the median nerve (which braches off of C6), and the C6 dermatome (note that these are different):        ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/concepts-musculoskeletal-medicine.html"},

Anatomy might be the only thing you study in med school that never changes during your career!  Classroom teaching will focus on highlights, fundamentals, and problem areas; cannot cover everything.  For those without an anatomy background:          Need to quickly get up to speed with an intro module.      Get this done soon!      Why study MSK?  Musculoskeletal Conditions:          Comprise the 2nd most common reason for physician visits.      The 2nd most common self-reported chronic condition among patients.      Have the greatest negative impact on health-related QoL in the industrialized world.        In 2003, only 42% of US med schools had a formal MSK block; MSK was rated highly importance but poorly in confidence and knowledge testing.Schedule  Top down organization.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/intro-msk.html"},
