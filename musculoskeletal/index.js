	{"title": "Imaging with Low Back Pain &amp; Radiculopathy", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Learn about common causes of low back pain and radiculopathy.          Radiculopathy → nerve root damage (due to any cause).        Identify red flags for less common causes of LBP requiring urgent care.  Discuss rational management strategies.  Objective      Learn about common causes of low back pain and radiculopathy.    Causes of low back pain can be classified by their anatomic location, or by their etiology:          Anatomic Location → cord, nerves, meninges, spinal arteries/veins, bony spine, discs, retroperitoneum, paravertebral soft tissues.      Etiology → (VITAMIN-C); Vascular, Infectious, Trauma, Autoimmune, Metabolic, Iatrogenic, Neoplastic, Congenital, etc.        Objective      Identify red flags for less common causes of LBP requiring urgent care.    As mentioned in the previous lecture, these are signs of:          Cancer or Infection.      Spinal Fracture.      Cauda Equina or Progressive Neurologic Deficits.        Cancer or Infection:          Age &gt;50 or &lt;20 y/o.                  Recall that &gt;50 increases likelihood of cancer; &lt;20 increases likelihood of infection.                    Past history of Cancer.      Unexplained weightloss, fever, chills.      Immunosuppression.      UTIs, IVDU.      Back pain not improved with rest, or night pain.        Spinal Fracture:          Previous trauma.      Steroid use (weakens bones).      Age &gt;70 years.        Cauda Equina Syndrome (or severe neurologic compromise):          Bowel dysfunction.      Bladder dysfunction.      Saddle anesthesia.      Erectile dysfunction.        Objective      Discuss rational management strategies.    MRI is the best diagnostic test for low back pain ($$$):          CTs ($$) are sometimes used as a complement to an MRI because they can show the bones better.      X-Rays ($) are used more as a screening tool, since they’re only really effective at showing the bones.        However, routine imaging does not improve patient outcomes.          In other words, not every patient who reports back pain needs to have imaging done!                  This is especially true since in 85% of cases, no specific diagnosis is made, and 90% of patients will improve without treatment.                    Routine imaging has some negative consequences as well:                  Accuracy:                          Imaging will often result in false positives; it cannot distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic findings.              Imaging will also often have false negatives; the spine is a dynamic structure, so the cause may not be present at the time of imaging.                                Cost → imaging is expensive, has psychological consequences, and exposes patients to radiation and other risks.          Utility                           Oftentimes, the medical management remains the same, regardless of the cause.              Why image all patients when the end treatment is the same?                                            When should imaging (MRI) be done then?          Generally, when red flags are present, as listed above.                  For more specific referral guidelines, see the Canadian Association of Radiologists Guidelines for the Spine.                    Management should be geared towards ruling out red flag causes (tumour, infection, fracture, cauda equina, progressive neurologic compromise), and aiming for conservative management otherwise.      Low Back Pain CasesCase #1  Case Summary      45 yo M    Low Back Pain x years    3 weeks pain radiating down right leg    Would you image this patient?          Yes → although this isn’t a red flag per se, the fact that his back pain has suddenly changed suggests that imaging would be helpful.      From the history, it suggests that this is a radiculopathy.      Since he doesn’t direclty meet the red flag criteria, an MRI does not need to be done urgently.        Imaging revealed a disc herniation, as seen below:          Note that T1 shows CSF as dark, and T2 shows CSF as bright.      This was a herniation of a lumbar disc.        What is the natural history of a lumbar disc herniation?          90% of patients with a lumbar disc herniation (even with radiculopathy) resolve in 6 weeks; however 5% will have recurrent disc herniation.      Conservative treatment is preferred (NSAIDs, PT, bed rest, epidural steroid injections may help).      Surgery can be done in some causes, but although it has a &gt;90% success rate, there’s a 5% risk of ‘failed back’ syndrome.      Failed Back Syndrome → where back pain persists after surgery.                    Causes are manifold, including recurrent disc herniation, arachnoiditis, infection, and an incorrect initial diagnosis.          One important cause is an epidural scar due to surgery, because it can easily be picked up on imaging (seen on the right).                    Case #2  Case Summary      79 yo M.    Back and leg pain with walking, relieved with sitting.    Imaging revealed lumbar spinal stenosis, as seen below:          Recall that this was a narrowing of the vertebral canal.      This results in neurogenic claudication when the spine is extended, which narrows the vertebral canal.      Hence, the patient has pain with walking (extending the spine), and it’s relieved with flexion.      As mentioned before, neurogenic claudication (caused by spinal stenosis) is different from vascular claudication: in one, the pain with walking is due to nerve compression; in the other, it’s due to vascular insufficiency.      Surgery can be done to decompress the canal.      Here, note that the thickening of the ligamentum flavum, posterior bulging of the disc, and inflammation of the facet joints results in narrowing of the vertebral canal.Case #3  Case Summary      21 yo M, varsity athlete    2 years of LBP    Would you image this patient?          Yes; the patient was &lt;20 when the back pain started.      Since he’s an athlete, he also undoubtedly has a past Hx of trauma.        Imaging revealed Spondylolysis, as seen below:          Recall that spondylolysis = fracture of the pars interarticularis.                  Fairly common: seen in 5-7% of the general population, and 22-44% of competitive athletes (!).                    Since the vertebrae is now no longer connected via the facet joint, it can easily slip out → spondylolisthesis.        How is Spondylolysis treated?          Conservative treatment, especially if the fracture only occurs in one site.      If spondylolysis proceeds to progressive spondylolisthesis (ie. the disc starts to slip), then surgical stabilization needs to be done.      Note the obvious fracture of the pars interarticularis. However, no slippage of the vertebrae has occured yet, ie. there's no spondylolisthesis.  When imaging the lumbar spine obliquely, the posterior elements of the vertebrae form a Scottie Dog (see below)          Scottie dog → ie, a Scottish Terrier.      The transverse process is the nose.      The pedicle forms the eye.      The inferior articular facet is the front leg.      The superior articular facet is the back leg.      The pars interarticularis (the part of the lamina between the two facets) is the neck.        Hence, when there’s spondylolysis, it looks like there’s a collar around the scottie dog’s neck          This could also be a decapitated scottie dog, if you’re of the macabre persuasion.        Remember      Spondylolysis (fracture of the pars interarticularis) results in a collared ‘Scottie Dog Sign’  Case #4  Case Summary      79 yo F.    Fell off chair 2 weeks ago.    Low Back Pain.    Would you image this patient?          Yes; she’s &gt;50, so you worry about a tumour or a fracture.        Imaging revealed the following:          Here, the T2 image was ‘fat suppressed’, where the fat brightness is suppressed.      Where is the abnormality here?                  Definitely L2, which has lost height and is pushing into the vertebral canal.          Also T12, where there’s some signal change at the top of the vertebral body (hyperintense on T2; hypointense on T1).                    Here, the compression of the vertebral canal at L2 is less significant than the signal change at T12 (which is much more suggestive of something insidious).        You have to differentiate this signal change as either osteoporotic changes or metastases:          Methods to differentiate the two won’t be tested.      However, it’s important to note that you have to rule out cancer when you see a signal change.        In this case, this was an Osteoporotic Compression Fracture:          These heal well in young patients, although there’s an increased incidence of future disc degeneration      In osteoporotic patients, this may progress.      Management is usually conservative.      Vertebroplasty can be done for severe persistent pain:                  Vertebroplasty → injection of bone cement into the collapsed vertebral body.          Thought to be a great, non-invasive approach to improve symptoms in these patients (no need to open up the back).          However, studies have shown that the effect of this procedure is largely due to a placebo effect.                          In a sham-controlled study, where control patients just received an injection of local anesthesia, there was a comparable improvement in symptoms!                                More recent observational studies suggest that there may still be a benefit in some cases, but vertebroplasty remains very controversial.                    Case #5  Case Summary      89 yo F.    fall on ice.    severe LBP, bedridden.    Imaging revealed a sacral insufficiency fracture, as shown below:          Insufficiency fractures are a type of stress fracture, which are the result of normal stresses on abnormal bone.      Hence, these are often seen with osteoporotic patients, with weakened bones.        A Nuclear Medicine Bone Scan can reveal a Honda Sign when there’s a sacral insufficiency fracture:          These bone scans (Bone Scintigraphy) involves using a radioisotope that localizes to regions of bone turnover.      The more active the bone turnover (eg, at a fracture), the more radioactive material will be seen.      With a sacral insufficiency fracture, the break will form an ‘H’, resulting in a Honda Sign (since it looks like the Honda logo), also known as an H-Sign.         Similar to vertebroplasty with an osteoporotic compression fracture, sacroplasty can be done with a sacral fracture:          Sacroplasty involves inserting two needles at an angle into the sacrum (sort of like two crossed lightsabers), to inject bone cement.      This helps stabilize the sacrum in a similar fashion to vertebroplasty.      Case #6  Case Summary      47 y/o F.    Low back pain x 12 months.    Occasional pain down both legs.    Should this person be imaged?          Probably not; no red flag features.      This would change if she had been treated conservatively, and hadn’t been responding to it.      In this case, an X-ray was done as a cheap and quick screening test, since it had been going on for a while.        A spine X-ray was done, revealing the following:            Is there anything peculiar here?      Note that the posterior part of the L2 vertebral body is caved in! (look at the margins of each vertebral body)      This suggests that there’s something pushing on the body from within the vertebral canal.      Since something was found on X-ray, an MRI was then ordered on the patient.        Imaging revealed a mass in the vertebral cord, as shown below          Note that it’s pressing on the L2 vertebrae, and it’s well circumscribed.      Imaging characteristics and the patient history (slow growing, well circumscribed, etc) suggested that this was a meningioma.        What are features of a Meningioma?          Meningioma → slow growing, benign tumour. It compresses, but does not invade.      Arises from the arachnoid.      Excellent prognosis with a complete excision (which is possible in &gt;95% of cases).      Adjunctive radiation is done if the tumour cannot completely be excised, or the tumour is aggressive.      Case #7  Case Summary      67 yo F.    Low Back Pain x 6 weeks.    Patient had constitutional symptoms.    Would you image this patient?          Yes; the patient is &gt;50, and had constitutional symptoms.      A screening X-ray revealed an abnormality at the level of L2/L3 (seen to the right).      Since there was an abnormal finding, the patient then proceeded to have an MRI.        An MRI revealed the following          Abnormal tissue, damage to the vertebral endplates, compression of the vertebral canal, and involvement of the intervertebral discs.      This is classic for osteomyelitis-discitis.        What are features of Osteomyelitis-Discitis?          Osteomyelitis → infection/inflammation of the bone or bone marrow.      Discitis → infection/inflammation in the intervertebral disc space.      Most commonly caused by Staph. aureus.                  E.coli is the most common Gram Negative cause.          Additionally, Salmonella is possible in patients with sickle cell, and TB is possible in patients with foreign travel.

	{"title": "Approach to Low Back Pain", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Recognize and identify common low back problems.  Develop an approach to treatment for low back pain.  Understand when to order tests and which ones.  Understand prognosis for different low back problems.  Know red flags and their signficance.Review of Spinal Anatomy  The spine is comprised of vertebral bodies, separated by intervertebral discs.  Adjacent vertebrae are attached to one another by facet joints.  The intervertebral discs are composed of an outer annulus and an inner nucleus.          The outer annulus is more fibrous; the inner nucleus is gel like.      Recall that the inner nucleus was a remnant of the notochord.        With a disc herniation, the outside annulus tears, leading to extravasation of the inner nuclear ‘gel’  Objective      Develop an approach to treatment for low back pain.  The Lower Back Pain History  85% will have no specific diagnosis; however most will get better within 1 month.  In general, the history is the most important part in determining a diagnosis with lower back pain.  Some things that you should assess on history include:          Pain → OPQRST      Weakness      Numbness/Tingling      Incoordination        Pain:          Pain that is dull/aching is more suggestive of muscle causes.      Pain that is throbbing can suggest nerve/muscle causes.      Sharp pain might suggest a fracture.      Burning/numbing/tingling pain suggests a nerve-related cause.        Weakness:          Suggests a nerve/muscle/tendon problem.      Determine what is week, and what structures are around the weak area.        Numbness/Tingling:          Numbness (ie. a loss of sensation) is always nerve related.      Tingling (ie. a ‘stinging sensation’) can be muscle related, or nerve related.        Incoordination:          Suggestive of a nerve/muscle problem.      Look at structures in the surrounding area.      The Physical Exam  The physical exam should be used to corroborate the story heard on history, and to rule out red flags.  Should only contribute 5% to the diagnosis; the history is by far the most important.  Tests are for motor, sensory, reflexes, gait, etc.  Objective      Know red flags and their signficance.    Red flags correspond to a few serious issues we worry about:          Infection      Tumours      Cauda Equina      Progressive Neurologic Deficits.        Red flags on history:          Age of the patient:                  &lt;20 or &gt;50.          Tumours are more likely in older patients; infections are more likely in younger patients.          When you see a patient in these ranges, suspect non-muscle/ligament pain.                    History of cancer → increases likelihood that pain is related to cancer mets.      Weight loss, night or rest pain                  Increases likelihood that this is cancer/infection related.                    Immunosuppresion, IV drug use, recent infection, fever, chills.                  Increases likelihood that this is infection related.                    Trauma → increases likelihood of fracture.      Bowel, bladder, saddle anesthesia, erectile dysfunction                  Suggestive signs of cauda equina.          Extremely important, because injury to cauda equina generally does not heal well, unlike other causes of back pain.          Patients with cauda equina syndrome will have long-lasting complications unless treated immediately!                      Yellow flags:          Yellow flags will affect complaince or patient response to back pain.      They include psychosocial factors like work status, litigation, depression, narcotic overuse, and the duration of symptoms.        Objective      Recognize and identify common low back problems.    The low back problems that will be discussed are as follows:          Tumour      Disc Herniation      Mechanical Causes (Stenosis, Spondylosis, Spondylolysis, Spondylolisthesis)      Tumour  Here, back pain is often associated with weight loss.  The most common tumour of the spine is metastases.          Spinal mets are actually seen in 10% of cancer patients.      The most common cancers that spread to the spine are prostate, breast, and lung cancers.        Metastases most commonly spread to the vertebral bodies, and generally don’t penetrate the spinal cord (97% are extradural).          Mets are spread to the spine via emboli through the blood stream.        Presentation:          Progressive pain, during rest and/or sleep.      Systemic symptoms (eg. unexplained weight loss).      Neurologic involvement: 76% of patients will be weak at the time of diagnosis.        Diagnosis:          MRI is best for visualization.      X-rays are non-sensitive; they’re usually only effective for fractures, or things specfic to the bone.      Bone scans can be used to look for regions of inflammation.                  Not useful generally, except for blastic types of tumours.                      Treatment:          Supportive → pain relief, preservation of neurologic function, preservation of spinal stability      Disc Herniation  Recall from Anatomy of the Spine that disc herniations most commonly occur in lordotic regions of the spine (ie. cervical/lumbar regions).          Hence, the most common levels for disc herniation are C5-6 and L5-S1.        Typically disc herniation is asymptomatic:          Disk herniation is a normal phenomenon in patients over the age of 45; it’s not worrisome unless it’s causing pain.      In one experiment, the entire US Olympic gymnastics team had their spine imaged. Everyone had disc herniation; none had back pain.        Symptoms will occur due to compression of the surrounding structures by the nucleus pulposus.          Recall that compression of the ligament will present with localized pain, while compression of a spinal nerve will result in radiation and neurologic features.        Diagnosis:          Most commonly from clinical history.                  Since posterior/posterolateral herniations are most common, pain will often be worse with flexion (which stretches the posterior spine), and better with extension (lying down, standing).                    EMG (electromyography), MRI, can also be done.        Treatment          Most disc herniations will resolve with conservative treatment:                  This applies even if the herniation pushes on the nerve!          Conservative treatment would include PT, exercise, avoiding certain postures, NSAIDs.                    The natural history is for improvement over 6 months - 2 years without surgery.                  Surgery is only done if the pain is progressive, neurologic signs are worsening, or if the patient needs to recover quickly for personal/professional reasons.          Another reason is if there Cauda Equina Syndrome, which will not resolve with conservative Tx.          Surgical options include disc replacement (if young, healthy, and one level involvement), or a partial discectomy.                    Surgery doesn’t improve outcomes; it just gets you there faster.        Cauda Equina Syndrome:          Compression of S2,3,4, which, as we recall, includes the pudendal nerve.      Hence, this results in bowel/bladder involvement, numbness around the perinanal region (saddle anesthesia), and erectile dysfunction.                  Recall that these were the red flags we discussed previously.                    Cauda Equina is a medical emergency → as mentioned before, these nerves don’t recover well conservatively, unlike with other herniations.        Classic Features of Cauda Equina      Bowel problems.    Bladder problems.    Saddle Anesthesia.    Erectile Dysfunction.  Lumbar Stenosis  Stenosis = narrowing of an area.  Lumbar stenosis = narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal or intervertebral foramen below a critical level, resulting in nerve compression.          Can be due to disc herniation, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, or osteophyte formation.        Presentation:          Pain, typically in the back and legs.                  Worse with extension, but better with flexion (the ‘shopping cart sign’, because flexing forward to push a shopping cart alleviates pain).          This is because extension narrows the vertebral canal, exacerbating the stenotic area.                    Numbness, tingling, and weakness are also possible signs, which may be present on physical exam.        Remember      Disc Herniation will be worse with flexion, and better with extension.              Since flexion stretches the posterior side of the spine, where most herniations occur.              Lumbar Stenosis will be worse with extension, and better with flexion.              Since extension narrows the vertebral canal, exacerbating the stenosis.              Leg pain with walking may be due to a neurogenic or a vascular cause:          Neurogenic → lumbar spinal stenosis.      Vascular → ie. claudication due to circulatory insufficiency.      Leg pain from either condition will go away with rest, but with spinal stenosis the patient usually has to sit down for a few minutes to ease the leg and often low back pain, whereas leg pain from vascular claudication will go away if the patient simply stops walking.        Cervical vs Lumbar Stenosis          Stenosis of the vertebral canal will present differently depending on whether it’s pinched in the cervical region or in the lumbar region.                  Cervical Stenosis results in an upper motor neuron problem.          Lumbar Stenosis results in a lower motor neuron problem.                    Recall that:                   Upper motor neuron = brain &amp; spinal cord.          Lower motor neuron = nerve roots (ie. once they leave the spinal cord).                    This makes it easy to remember that lumbar stenosis is a lower motor neuron problem; since the spinal cord ends at L1/L2, any narrowing beyond this point will be outside the spinal cord (and hence LMN).      Knowing this is important in making a diagnosis:                  Upper motor neuron problems will result in hyperreflexia and spasms.          Lower motor neuron problems will result in the opposite: atrophy, muscle weakness, etc.                      Remember      Cervical Stenosis results in an upper motor neuron problem.    Lumbar Stenosis results in a lower motor neuron problem.  Spondylosis, Spondylolysis, Spondylolisthesis  These 3 terms sound similar, but mean different things (very confusing):          Spondylosis → degenerative changes of the spine.      Spondylolysis → fracture of the pars interarticularis.                  Pars interarticularis = the connection between the two facets of the facet joint (the superior and inferior articular facets).                    Spondylolisthesis → slippage of vertebrae relative to adjacent one, usually due to a pars interarticularis fracture (spondylolysis).        Spondylosis vs. Spondylolysis vs. Spondylolisthesis      Spondylosis → degenerative changes of the spine.    Spondylolysis → fracture of the pars interarticularis.    Spondylolisthesis → slippage of one vertebrae relative to another, typically due to spondylolysis.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Spine", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe normal curvatures of the spine.  Identify the key features of vertebral column and compare various views of radiographic images.  Identify and describe the joints and ligaments of the vertebral column, including the intervertebral discs, zygopophyseal, sacroiliac joint.  List the muscles that support the back.  Describe the Spinal Cord in Relation to the Vertebral Column and the clinical significance.Spinal Anatomy  The vertebral column is made up of a curved series of bones, called vertebrae.  These vertebrae are classified as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, or coccygeal.  The number of vertebrae in each is as follows:          Cervical → 7 vertebrae.      Thoracic → 12 vertebrae.      Lumbar → 5 vertebrae.      Sacral → 5 vertebrae.      Coccygeal → 3-5 vertebrae (this varies since this is a vestigial structure).        As we saw long ago in ITM, one easy way to remember this is the times at which you’d eat breakfast (7), lunch (12), and dinner (5).  The total number of vertebrae is usually 33.          The sacral vertebrae are fused to form the sacrum.      The coccygeal vertebrae are fused to form the coccyx, aka. the tailbone.        The vertebral canal, which houses and protects the spinal cord, runs through the vertebral foramen of each vertebrae.  Note that as we go cranially to caudally, the intervertebral discs get thicker. This allows the lower spine to support more weight.  In addition, there are some key vertebrae that have some specific names:            C1 → aka. the atlas.                  This is the bone that supports the head, hence it’s known as the ‘atlas’.          Note that C1 does not have a body; it’s shaped like a ring for the head to balance on top of.                    C2 → aka. the axis.                  C2 projects into the atlas, and facilitates its rotation. Hence, it’s referred to as the ‘axis’, since it acts as an axis of rotation.          Its projection (which sticks through into C1 like a finger through a ring), is called the odontoid process, or the dens/peg.                    C7 → aka. the vertebra prominens.                  C7 is known as the ‘vertebra prominens’ because its spinous process is longer and more prominent than with the other spinous processes.          Hence it’s used as a landmark when examining the head and neck (it’s the first ‘big bump’ you feel when you palpate the bones of your spine from behind).          It’s difficult to feel the spinous processes above C7 because they’re smaller, and there’s a ligament in front of them (the ligamentum nuchae).                    Normal Curvatures of the Spine  During development, the entire spine is ‘C’ shaped and kyphotic (see right).  Hence, any curvature of the spine that is kyphotic is referred to as a primary curvature, since it mirrors the embryonic curvature, and was present before birth.  Any lordotic curvature of the spine is dissimilar from the embryologic curvature, and is hence referred to as a secondary curvature.  Hence, we have a:            Secondary cervical curve (ie. cervical lordosis).      Primary thoracic curve (ie. thoracic kyphosis).      Secondary lumbar curve (ie. lumbar lordosis).      Primary sacral curve (ie. sacral kyphosis).        The secondary curvatures arise after birth:          The secondary cervical curve arises when the baby begins to hold up its head.      The secondary lumbar curve arises when the baby begins to walk.        In women, the lordotic lumbar curve is more prominent (hence it seems like women ‘stick out their butt more’).  Clinically, kyphosis, lordosis, and scoliosis also refer to excessive curvatures of the spine:          Kyphosis = excessive thoracic kyphosis (ie. a hunchback).      Lordosis = excessive lumbar lordosis.      Scoliosis = lateral curvature (ie. in the coronal plane).      Features of the Spinal Vertebra  There is a solid body, which is what lies above/below the intervertebral discs.          The shape of the body differs depending on the level of the vertebrae: thoracic vertebrae have a heart shaped body; lumbar vertebrae have a kidney shaped body.      To remember this, just picture the organs in each region (the heart is thoracic, the kidneys are lumbar).        From this body extends two stems called pedicles.  At the end of these pedicles are transverse processes that stick outwards.          These transverse processes are thick in the thoracic region, where the ribs need to attach to them.      They become slender in the lumbar region, where the muscles attach.        From this, two projections then come together medially and connect to form a spinous process. This is what ‘sticks out of your back’.  The bone that comes from the pedicles to the spinous process is flattened; hence it’s called the lamina.  The hole bordered by the pedicles and the lamina is where the spinal cord will run through; this hole is called the vertebral foramen.          Together, all of the vertebral foramen form the vertebral canal.        In addition, there are 2 processes that extend upwards and 2 processes that extend downwards from each vertebrae; these are known as superior articular processes and inferior articular processes respectively.          The inferior articular processes connect with the superior articular processes of the vertebrae immediately below the current one.      Where they join, they form a facet joint (aka. a zygapophysial joint). This is circled in red above.      This is a synovial joint that guides and restricts lateral rotation (from side to side). Note that the facet joints are not built for weight bearing.        Between the body of each vertebrae is an intervertebral disc.  How many processes extend from each vertebrae?          We have 2 transverse processes that project to the side.      We have 1 spinous process that projects posteriorly.      We have 2 superior articular processes that project up.      We have 2 inferior articular processes that project down.      In other words, there are 7 processes that extend from each vertebrae.      Above is a CT scan (left) and an X-ray (right) of the spine. Note that the spinal cord lies between the vertebral bodies and the spinous processes.Ligaments of the Spine  There are 5 major ligaments that you need to know about:          Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL):                  As given by the name, this lies anterior to the vertebral bodies.          This is a tough ligament, because it needs to oppose the anterior push of the vertebrae (there are important structures anteriorly).                    Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL):                  This lies just posterior to the vertebral bodies.          This is a weaker ligament than the ALL, and is actually somewhat fused to the vertebral bodies.          Note that this does not lie posterior to the vertebrae themselves; rather it lies just behind the vertebral bodies, on the anterior side of the vertebral foramen.                    Ligamentum Flavum                  This is particularly important, because it’s the strongest ligament in the spine. It helps protect elements in the canal.          Flavum = yellow, so just like its name implies, this ligament is yellow. The yellow coloration is because this is composed of fibrocartilage.          This lies on the posterior side of the vertebral foramen.          In other words, the vertebral foramen is covered by the PLL in the front, and the ligamentum flavum in the back.                    Interspinous Ligament                  As the name implies, this ligament wraps between the spinous processes of the spinal vertebrae.          This is fairly flexible, in order to allow for the flexion and rotation of the spine.                    Supraspinous Ligament                  Just as the name suggests, this wraps over the spinous processes, and is hence the most posterior ligament of the spine.          Since this wraps outside the spinous processes, it’s less flexible than the interspinous ligament.                      This also corresponds to the position of the ligaments anteriorly to posteriorly, ie:          ALL → PLL → ligamentum flavum → interspinous → supraspinous.      This can be better seen in the figure below.        When would you pierce these ligaments clinically?          You would pierce the posterior ligaments (supraspinous, interspinous, ligamentum flavum) if you were performing a spinal tap or epidural.      Why is this a safe spot to inject anesthetic?       Recall that in the vertebral canal, we also have blood vessels. However, most of these blood vessels are present anteriorly, so a posterior approach reduces the risk of bleeding.      Also, we inject anesthetic at the level of L4 (the PSIS), which is below the conus medullaris. Hence, we avoid the spinal cord and instead inject between fibres of the cauda equina.      The Intervertebral Discs  The intervertebral discs are comprised of an fibrous outer layer and a soft inner layer.          The fibrous outer layer is referred to as the annulus fibrosus.      The soft, gelatinous inner layer is referred to as the nucleus pulposus.        These have different origins embryologically:          Recall that the notochord develops into the neural tube.      The vertebral column develops around the neural tube.      As this happens, the notochord actually gets absorbed into the vertebral column, and becomes the nucleus pulposus.        Remember      The nucleus pulposus (inner layer of the intervertebral discs) is the remnant of the notochord.    There’s no blood supply feeding the intervertebral discs, so how do they get nutrients?          They obtain nutrients from the surrounding vessels, through a neat mechanism.      In a loaded state (seated/standing), the intervertebral discs are compressed, forcing H2O molecules out. This water is absorbed by surrounding capillaries.      In an unloaded state (lying down), this fluid (supplemented with nutrients), gushes back into the discs.      This transmission of fluid in and out of the discs also explains why you’re taller with some rest. 25% of the vertebral length is accounted for by the discs, so any change in this thickness can have a noticeable impact on height.        A herniated disc occurs when there’s a tear in the outer layer of the disc, allowing the nucleus pulposus to leak out.          This is most commonly a posterior or posterolateral herniation, because, as we recall the ligament behind the vertebral bodies (the PLL) is weaker than the one in front of the bodies (the ALL).      In addition, since the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine are lordotic, the posterior side of the disc is squished more tightly than the anterior side of the disc, making it more likely to tear.      Hence, cervical and lumbar posterior/posterolateral tears are the most common presentation.      Other names for a herniated disc include: (1) prolapsed disc, (2) ruptured disc and (3) slipped disc.        What clinical findings would you see with a lumbar herniated disc?          Posterior herniation                  Here, the nucleus pulposus presses against the posterior longitudinal ligament, leading to lumbago, aka. low back pain.          This pain is generally local to the back, because it’s caused by the irritation of pain fibres along the PLL.                    Posterolateral herniation.                  Here, the nucleus pulposus protrudes laterally to the PLL, and pushes against a spinal nerve root, leading to sciatica.          Impingement of the sciatic nerve causes pain that radiates to the buttocks, back of the thick, and lateral leg and foot (where the sciatic nerve innervates).          Here, you can do nerve specific tests, to determine the level of the herniation.                    This video is a great review of the differences between the two.        Posterior vs Posterolateral Herniation                             Posterior Herniation        Posterolateral Herniation                            Irritates the:        Posterior Longitudinal Ligament        Spinal nerve root                    Pain characteristics        Local to back        Radiates                    May cause (in lumbar region):        Lumbago        Sciatica            Features of the Cervical Vertebrae  There are some key differences between the cervical vertebrae and vertebrae in other regions.  As mentioned before, you can’t feel the spinous processes above C7, because of the presence of a thick ligament called the ligamentum nuchae.  In addition, there is no intervertebral disc between C1 and C2.  In the C3-C6 vertebrae, the edges of the vertebral bodies push out and form uncinate processes (circled in red above).          Furthermore, the intervertebral discs don’t extend to the very edge of the vertebral bodies here, so a fluid-filled space is formed.      The coupling of this space with the uncinate processes becomes the uncovertebral joints (of Lushka).      This becomes important as you age, because osteophytes commonly form here, leading to uncovertebral osteoarthritis.        These changes may accompany the osteoarthritic changes seen in ankylosing spondylitis and be a cause of chronic neck pain.      In addition, the osteophytes can cause a progressive narrowing of the intervertebral foramen where the spinal nerves and vertebral arteries come out. This can lead to compressive symptoms.      Note that the vertebral foramen is not the same as the intervertebral foramen; the latter is shown to the right, and is bordered by the pedicles and the back of the spinous processes.      Surface Anatomy of the Back  Key surface landmarks include:          Erector spinae → longitudinal muscles on either side of the spine, that keep the back erect.      Posterior Superior Iliac Spine → usually a ‘dimple’ on the back, that aligns to the level of L4/L5. Used to landmark where an epidural/spinal goes.      Extrinsic Muscles of the Back  The most superficial muscles of the back include:          Trapezius → comes off the occipital bone, and covers C1-T12.                  Nerve Supply → CN XI (Spinal Accessory Nerve), and branches from the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves.          Actions → depends on the part. The trapezius has a superior, transverse, and inferior region, which raises, retracts, and depresses the scapula respectively.                    Latissiumus dorsi → merges at the thoracolumbar fascia (the deep fascia of the back).                  Nerve Supply → thoracodorsal nerve.          Actions → adducts and medially rotates the humerus (eg. when you’re doing a pullup).                    Teres major → nicknamed the ‘minor lats’, or baby lats. Functionally similar to the latissimus dorsi.      Deltoid → forms the contours of the shoulder. Attaches to the scapula.        Below (on the right), the trapezius has been removed to reveal deeper muscles.          Here we see the rhomboid minor and rhomboid major muscles, which attach to the medial margin of the scapula.      Above this, we also see the levator scapula, which attaches to the superior angle of the scapula, and, as the name suggests, lifts the scapula.      All 3 of these muscles help retract and keep the scapula close to the vertebral column.      Frop top to bottom, the muscles attach to the scapula as follows:                  Levator scapulae → rhomboid minor → rhomboid major.          These attach to the medial margin of the scapula (1) above the spine of the scapula, (2) at the spine of scapula, and (3) below the spine of scapula respectively.                      Unlabeled on the above image, are the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.           These are the muscles that cover the scapula, and lie above and below the spine of the scapular respectively.      They attach to the greater tubercle of the humerus.      Extrinsic Muscles of the Back                   Origin      Insertion      Action      Innervation                  Trapezius      External occipital protuberance; nuchal ligament and spinous processes of C7-T12      Lateral 1/3 of clavicle, acromion and spine of scapula      Elevates, retracts and rotates scapula; superior fibers elevate, medial fibers retract and inferior fibers depress scapula.      Spinal root of accessory nerve (CN XI and C3, C4)              Latissimus Dorsi      Thoracolumbar fascia      Middle of the bicipital groove of the humerus      Adducts and medially rotates humerus      Thoracodorsal nerve              Levator Scapulae      Transverse processes of C1-C4      Medial scapula above the level of the spine of scapula      Raises the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)              Rhomboid Minor      Spinous processes of C7-T1      Medial scapula at the level of the spine of scapula      Retracts the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)              Rhomboid Major      Spinous processes of T2-T5      Medial scapula below the level of the spine of scapula      Depresses the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)      	All of these muscles are innervated by branches of the brachial plexus except for the trapezius	The trapezius is supplied by the spinal accessory nerve, ie. cranial nerve XIIntrinsic Muscles of the Back  The intrinsic muscles of the back affect the vertebral column.  Intrinsic muscles of the back include:          Splenius cervicus → looks like a ‘band-aid’ around the neck; helps keep it upright.      Erector spinae → as mentioned before, this is a long muscle that helps keep the spine upright. However, it’s actually comprised of 3 groups:                  Ileocostalis → has fibres that extend and attach to the ribs (see below)          Longissiumus → longitudinal band of muscle.          Spinalis → closest to the spine.                    To remember the branches of the erector spinae, laterally to medially, remember I LIKE STANDING (ileocostalis, longissimus, spinalis).        What is the innervation of the erector spinae muscles?          This is fairly intuitive: the dorsal rami of the spinal nerves.      If you visualize where the muscles are (right beside and behind the spine), it makes sense that the dorsal rami innervate them!        Remember      The muscles of the erector spinae include:              Ileocostalis        Longissimus        Spinalis              Remember these as I LIKE STANDING.    Deep to the erector spinae, and directly adjacent to the spinal vertebrae, are a group of muscles called transverso-spinalis group of muscles (circled below).          These muscles run obliquely between the transverse processes and spinous processes of the vertebrae.      They help maintain the upright posture and extension of the vertebral column.      As with the erector spinae, these are innervated by the dorsal rami.      The Spinal Cord  The spinal cord originates as an extension of the medulla oblongata in the brainstem, and exits through the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal.  However, the spinal cord does not travel all the way down the vertebral canal; it actually stops at the level of L1/L2.          At this point, the spinal cord tapers into a cone-shaped structure called the conus medullaris.      The space between L1/L2 (where the spinal cord ends), and S2 (where the vertebral canal ends) is referred to as the lumbar cistern.      In the lumbar cistern, the roots of the lumbar and sacral spinal nerves fan outwards, to form the cauda equina (horse’s tail).        Why does the spinal cord end before the vertebral canal does?          Embryologically, the spinal cord continued to the end of the vertebral canal, at S2.      However, as the embryo develops, the vertebral column grows faster relative to the spinal cord.      Hence, just like with the kidneys, this is a ‘relative ascent’.        When a lumbar puncture is done, it’s done at the level of the PSIS (L4/L5). This is because the needle will then enter the lumbar cistern, where it is less likely to puncture something.  Wrapping the entire spinal cord is the meninges, which comprise of the:          Dura mater (dural sac).      Arachnoid mater.      Pia mater → directly envelops the spinal cord and brain.        Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the cerebrospinal fluid, ie. in the subarachnoid space.  Hence, the dura and arachnoid mater lie outside the CSF, while the pia mater lies beneath the CSF. As a result, the outside lining of the spinal cord is often referred to as the dura-arachnoid.Spinal Nerve Roots  Note that there are 7 cervical vertebrae, but 8 cervical nerves:          So the C1 nerve lies above the C1 vertebrae, but C8 actually lies above the T1 vertebrae.      As a result, all of the lower nerves (thoracic, lumbar, sacral, etc) lie below their corresponding vertebrae.      That is, the L3 nerve lies below the L3 vertebrae, and so on and so forth.        Clinical Application:          If a disc herniation occurred between C5 and C6, then the C6 nerve would be affected, since it lies above the C6 vertebrae.      However, if a disc herniation occurred between L3 and L4, then the L3 nerve would be affected, since it lies below the L3 vertebrae.        Remember      Cervical nerves lie above their corresponding vertebrae.    All lower nerves lie below their corresponding vertebrae.    This is because there are 8 cervical nerves, but only 7 cervical vertebrae, resulting in an offset.    Key spinal nerve associations:          C1-C4 → Cervical Plexus.      C3,4,5 → Phrenic Nerve (C3,4,5 keeps your diaphragm alive).      C5-T1 → Brachial plexus (will be seeing this in gory detail soon).      T1-T12 → Intercostal Nerves.      L1-L4 → Lumbar Plexus.      L4-S3 → Sacral Plexus.      S2,3,4 → Pudendal Nerve.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/anatomy-spine.html"},
	{"title": "Approach to the Spine", "text": "Lecture Objectives  To introduce basic spine anatomy  To identify clinically relevant spine anatomy  – I.e. understand how anatomy is important to the assessment and diagnosis of spinal pathology.  To correlate spinal anatomy with clinical assessment and radiographic interpretation.Introduction  The spine is a commonly complained about area for patients, doctors, and students.  The spine is an anatomically complex region.  We’ll be focusing on the big picture, rather than the details:          “Learn the big things rather than the details; this is a generalization that holds good throughout the realm of medicine, and I advise you to evaporate your knowledge not to dryness but to a serviceable bulk. Larger structures, as a rule, are far more important than smaller ones, and moreover will act as guides or ‘rallying‐points’ in calling the latter to mind.” (S.E. Whitnall, 1933)      Anatomic Planes  As we saw in first year:          The sagittal plane splits the body into left and right.      The coronal (frontal) plane splits the body into front and back.      The transverse (axial) plane splits the body into top and bottom.      Spinal Surface Anatomy  The surface anatomy gives you clues as to what’s going on deeper in the body.  Important landmarks include          C7 = vertebral prominence.                  This is the vertebral bump at the base of your neck.          Useful in localizing an injury to a specific vertebral level.                    L4 = typically at the level of the PSIS                  PSIS = Posterior Superior Iliac Spine          Useful when doing spinal anesthesia (ie. an epidural).          When performing an epidural, the patient is also usually flexed (since that increases the space in the vertebral canal). We saw this with Pattern 4 back pain in Family Week.                    Spinal Anatomy  The spinal cord originates from the foramen magnum (the opening in the base of the skull), and tapers down to a cone-like structure called the conus medullaris at the level of L1.          Note that the spinal cord doesn’t go all the way down the vertebral canal; it actually stops at L1.      The remaining nerve roots actually project down past the cord, and fan out to form the cauda equina (the horse’s tail).      This is why the PSIS (at L4) is such a useful landmark; at that point, your needle will be below the spinal cord, so you’re less likely to puncture a nerve.        Remember      The spinal cord originates at the foramen magnum, and ends at the conus medullaris at the level of L1.    The remaining nerve roots then fan out to form the cauda equina.    Cauda Equina Syndrome → when there’s injury to the cauda equina (eg. via compression or trauma).          The most common cause of this is disk herniation.      Since the nerves in the cauda equina innervate the perineum, bladder, anal sphincters, and external genitalia, you end up with corresponding issues.        Dermatome vs Myotome:          Dermatome → the region on the skin that’s covered by a specific nerve root.      Myotome → the muscles that are innervated by a specific nerve root.      Although there’s overlap between the two, they are NOT the same.      Functions of the Spine  Structural support and balance for upright posture.  Protects the spinal cord and neural elements.  Allows for mobility.  To achieve these functions, the spine must be:          Resistant to axial loading forces.      Elastic        Resistance and elasticity are obtained from the alternating kyphotic (humped) and lordotic curves of the spine along the sagittal plane, by acting like a spring.  Kyphosis vs Lordosis      Kyphosis = curved forward. (Kypho- = humped).    Lordosis = curved backward. (Lordo- = curved).    Motion Segment → the functional unit of the spine.  Components of the motion segment include:          2 adjacent vertebrae.      1 intervertebral disc.      2 facet joints.        The motion segments are called ‘motion segments’ because they facilitate the movement of the spine (eg. flexion and extension).Bones and Ligaments of the SpineBones of the Spine  The spine is comprised of vertebrae.  For each vertebrae:           There is a solid body, which is what lies above/below the intervertebral discs.      From this body extends two projections called pedicles.      At the end of these pedicles are transverse processes that stick outwards.      From this, two projections then come together medially and connect to form a spinous process. This is what ‘sticks out of your back’.      The bone that comes from the pedicles to the spinous process is flattened; hence it’s called the lamina.      The gap between the pedicles and the lamina is where the spinal cord will run through; this hole is called the vertebral foramen.      Ligaments of the Spine  Ligament = between bone and bone.  Tendon = between bone and something else (muscle, eye, etc).  There are 5 major ligaments that you need to know about:          Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL):                  As given by the name, this lies anterior to the vertebral bodies.                    Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL):                  This lies just posterior to the vertebral bodies.          Note that this does not lie posterior to the vertebrae themselves; rather it lies just behind the vertebral bodies, on the anterior side of the vertebral foramen.                    Ligamentum Flavum                  This is particularly important, because it’s the strongest ligament in the spine. It helps protect elements in the canal.          Flavum = yellow, so just like its name implies, this ligament is yellow.          This lies on the posterior side of the vertebral foramen.          In other words, the vertebral foramen is covered by the PLL in the front, and the ligamentum flavum in the back.                    Interspinous Ligament                  As the name implies, this ligament wraps between the spinous processes of the spinal vertebrae.                    Supraspinous Ligament                  Just as the name suggests, this wraps over the spinous processes, and is hence the most posterior ligament of the spine.                      This also corresponds to the position of the ligaments anteriorly to posteriorly, ie:          ALL → PLL → ligamentum flavum → interspinous → supraspinous.      This can be better seen in the figure below.        Ligaments of the Spine      Anteriorly to posteriorly, we have the:              Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL)        Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL)        Ligamentum Flavum        Interspinous Ligament        Supraspinous Ligament            Case Presentation  On the top right is a c-spine X-ray of a patient that had a motor vehicle accident.  Note the loss of lordosis compared to the normal c-spine:          Mormally, the cervical spine is lordotic as shown on the left. On the right, note that there’s a relative kyphosis.      This suggests that there’s some injurious process going on.      Furthermore, there’s widening between the spinous processes, further suggesting injury.        The MRI on the right showed fluid entering the spinal column (note the white stuff on the right).          Note that the fluid is tracking from the posterior side of the neck to just outside the spinal cord.      That means that it must have gone through (1) supraspinous ligament and (2) interspinous ligament.      If the fluid had gone into the vertebral canal, then the ligamentum flavum would also have been damaged.      Aging of the Spine  Pain can arise from the joints, discs, nerve roots, or soft tissue of the spine.  As you age, degenerative changes in the spine can exacerbate or cause pain.  Degenerative changes in the spine (both normal and abnormal), include:            Degenerative disc → the discs, which are normally fluid filled, begin to dry out and become dessicated. This makes them less able to deal with weight bearing.      Bulged disc → the disc begins to stick out past the vertebral bodies.      Herniated disc → the gelatinous inner nucleus of the disc extravasates out of the fibrous outer layer.      Thinning disc → as the inner nucleus dries out, the disc becomes thinner.      Disc degeneration with osteophyte formation → as the spine becomes less stable, the vertebral bodies begin to form bone spurs called osteophytes.      Scoliosis  Scoliosis → lateral curvature of the spine &gt;10°.  This involves both a lateral curvature deformity and a rotational deformity.          That is, not only is the spine bent in the coronal plane, it’s also rotated about its axis.        This rotation can be assessed with something known as Adam’s Forward Bend Test:          To perform the test, you have the patient stand up, with their legs and hands together. You then have them bend forward with their head down.      With scoliosis, you’ll see a prominence on one side due to the rotation of the spine. (see image to the right).      In fact, the rotation of the spine actually causes a deformity of the chest wall.      This is why severe scoliosis can present with breathing difficulties!      Adolescent (Idiopathic) Scoliosis  The most common type of scoliosis.  Presentation          Girls &gt; boys, age &gt; 10 years      Presents as a painless curve in spine.        Etiology → not well understood.  Physical Exam          Coronal spinal curvature.      Rib/lumbar prominence (via Adam’s Forward Bend Test).      Rule out neurologic or associated conditions.                  If you have pain, neurologic symptoms, or rapidly progressive scoliosis, then this is atypical, and hence is a red flag.          Hence, these red flags would make an idiopathic scoliosis less likely, and point to an underlying cause (post-traumatic, tumour, or another anatomical cause).                      Treatment          Depends on patient age, growth remaining, progression of the scoliosis, &amp; severity of the curve.      Observation, bracing, surgery.

Objective      Describe the meaning of impairment, disability, and handicap.    Impairment → ‘Any loss or abnormality of psyhological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function’ (WHO).          Functions at an organ level, ie. a problem involving structure or function (eg. torn achilles tendon).        Disability → ‘An activity limitation that creates a difficulty in the performance, accomplishment, or completion of an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being’ (WHO).          Functions at a person level, ie. failing to do a task or activity (eg. can’t walk up stairs).        Handicap → ‘A disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual (WHO).          Functions at a societal level, eg. unable to work as a bar manager.        Objective      Develop alternative approaches to forming the differential diagnosis in MSK disorders.    Integrate some common patterns for MSK disorders from the history into differential formation.    Some approaches include the following:          Inflammatory vs Degenerative.      Anatomic.      Pain characterization.      Presence of Weakness.      Abnormal Sensation.      Root or peripheral nerve cause.        Inflammatory vs Degenerative          Broadly speaking, MSK disorders can be classified as either inflammatory or degenerative.      Inflammatory disorders will present with pain at rest; degenerative disorders will present with pain with activity.        Degenerative vs Inflammatory Features                    Degenerative        Inflammatory                            Pain with activity        Pain at rest                    May report stiffness        Morning stiffness                    Locking        Swelling                    Instability        Warmth                    May have weakness        Rash                    Swelling? (secondary)        Malaise                             Fever / weight loss / constitutional symptoms              Anatomic          Differential may be highly anatomically based.      Use the ‘generic joint’ → what do all joints have in common?      Apply this to specific joint tissues → ligaments, muscles/tendons, nerves.      Note: # is shorthand for fracture.        Pain Characterization          Pain may be single most common spoken word in musculoskeletal medicine      There are various approaches to take the ‘pain history’ (eg. OPQRST). Another one is ‘OLD CARS’:                  Onset.          Location.          Duration.          Characteristics (quality, severity).          Aggrevating/alleviating.          Radiation.          Symptoms (elsewhere/related).                    Consider the below 4 patients, all presenting with R wrist pain. From the history, we can see that they have very different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis.          Scaphoid Fracture          Rheumatoid Arthritis.          Septic joint.                      Weakness          Weakness is an exceedingly common complaint when pain is involved → if it hurts, you don’t want to move it (hence you have weakness).      Difficulty 1 → is it weakness, or pain, or both?                  Pain without weakness is common.          Painless weakness limits the differential.                    Difficulty 2 → if it’s true weakness, what is causing it? (see possible structures below)        Below are 3 patients, each presenting with foot weakness. Again, they have different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  Tibialis anterior rupture.          Common peroneal neuropathy.          ACA stroke.                      Abnormal Sensation          Abnormal sensation suggests a peripheral nerve injury, which may result in paradoxical sensory changes:                  Increased/spontaneous sensation.          Diminished functional sensation.                    However, tingling and/or outright pain may have a number of causative tissue impairments (eg. nerve, muscle, tendon, bone/joint, referred, etc).      BUT true sensory loss is ALWAYS neurogenic → on P/E, you have to differentiate this from ‘numbness’, which is often vaguely defined by the patient.        Roots vs Peripheral Nerves          Consider the case of a ‘numb thumb’ (frequent tingles, diminished 2-pt discrimination).      Two things in the DDx should include:                  Carpal tunnel syndrome.          C6 Radiculopathy (root level pathology).                    So do we inject their risk, or MRI their neck?      Why are both of these in the differential?                  The C6 nerve root travels down the arm, and becomes the median nerve (which is involved in carpal tunnel syndrome).          The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the thumb, as well as motor innervation to the APB (Abductor Pollicus Brevis muscle at the base of the thumb).          The C6 nerve root also branches into the musculocutaneous nerve, which provides  motor innervation to the biceps.                    Hence, by looking at associated symptoms (eg. biceps weakness), you can help refine your diagnosis!          Root vs. Peripheral Nerve          Nerve roots are not the same as peripheral nerves!      These are similar but not the same; an important concept in MSK/nerve injury.      You must be able to differentiate:                   Dermatome from peripheral nerve territory.          Myotome from peripheral nerve territory.                    For instance, compare the region of innervation of the median nerve (which braches off of C6), and the C6 dermatome (note that these are different):        ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/concepts-musculoskeletal-medicine.html"},

Musculoskeletal Conditions:          Comprise the 2nd most common reason for physician visits.      The 2nd most common self-reported chronic condition among patients.      Have the greatest negative impact on health-related QoL in the industrialized world.        In 2003, only 42% of US med schools had a formal MSK block; MSK was rated highly importance but poorly in confidence and knowledge testing.Schedule  Top down organization.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/intro-msk.html"},
