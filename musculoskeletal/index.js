	{"title": "Soft Tissue Injuries Small Group", "text": "Case #1  Neck Pain Case  A 43 year-old painter comes to see you about her severe neck pain. She tells you that her symptoms started about four weeks ago when she began working for a new client and had to assemble scaffolding on the first day. When she woke the next morning, she had pain in the lower neck on the right side rated 9 of 10. Since the onset of the pain, she has been unable to fully extend her neck. She tells you that occasionally the pain radiates across the shoulder or into her midback. She also tells you that she experiences headaches related to the neck pain. Her review of systems and past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.  List your top 5 differential diagnoses for this patient’s presentation.          Cervical radiculopathy.      Myofascial pain.      Disc pain.      Facet joint pain.      Osteoarthritis.        Physical Exam Findings  On physical exam, there are no fasciculations or atrophy. Her reflexes are 2+ on the left and on the right. Strength testing is equal bilaterally. Range of motion of the neck is limited by pain, especially in extension and rotation. Spurling’s maneuver is negative. The patient has tenderness to palpation over the paraspinal muscles and over the facet joints.   What is the most likely diagnosis given this patient’s presentation?          Facet joint pain → since there’s tenderness over the facet joints.      Normal reflexes and strength suggest that it’s not a neuronal problem (upper motor neuron will cause hyperreflexia, lower motor neuron will cause delayed reflexes).      Spurling’s maneuver → laterally rotate and flex the patient’s head, and press down on the top of their head to impinge the nerve.                  If there’s pre-existing nerve root compression, this will result in pain.                      If this patient’s findings had included ataxia, pain radiating into her legs, tingling or pins-and-needles sensation in the legs, and new onset urinary incontinence, what would the most likely diagnosis be?          Spinal root compression, eg. due to a disc herniation.        What tests may be helpful in arriving at a definitive diagnosis?          Primarily by Hx and P/E, especially if there are no neurologic deficits.      Plain films (XRs) and obliques (showing the ‘Scottie Dog’) may help localize the issue to the facet joints.      MRI is the best (but most expensive and difficult to get) test with spinal issues.        What management would you recommend for this patient?          Conservative management; ice, rest, NSAIDs.      Short term neck support (long-term neck support may weaken the surrounding muscles).      If there’s no response to conservative therapy, other interventions like intra-articular injections or medial branch rhizotomies can be considered.      Case #2  Back Pain Case  A 28-year-old male construction worker injured his back while moving a piece of heavy machinery. He was flexed and rotated at the time of the injury. The doctor in the walk-in clinic put him on one week of bed rest but even after that, pain in the low back region has been unremitting. Numerous radiological investigations are all negative. The pain is localized to the low back with mild radiation to the buttocks. Tenderness is present quite diffusely over the low back. Pain is worse on lumbar extension. Neurological examination is normal.  You, a physiatrist with many years of experience, are now seeing him 12 weeks post-injury. He has been unable to return to work. He has gained 10 pounds. He takes 12 Tylenol #3s per day. He has difficulty sleeping because of the pain and lately because of financial worries. He spends most of his time watching TV. He smokes a pack per day, and drinks 3-4 alcoholic beverages and 5 cups of coffee per day.  What are the most probable diagnoses of his back pain? (think anatomically)          Facet joint pain.      Disc herniation.      Spinal stenosis.      Myofascial pain.        What is the significance of back pain that is worse with extension?          Pattern 1B or 2 back pain.      Increases likelihood that this is related to the spine (ie. facet joint pain, spondylolisthesis, disk herniation, etc).        What are risk factors for chronic low back pain? What features in this patient’s history predisposed him to chronic pain?          Psychosocial factors.      Inability to return to work.      Sedentary lifestyle.      Smoking/alcohol use.        From a medical point of view, what is the impact of this injury on the patient? What is the psychological impact?          Medical impact → drug dependence, impaired IADLs, impact on QALYs.      Psychological impact → affects mood, self-esteem, financial security, sense of purpose, and sleep.        What medications or modalities may be beneficial here? What other allied health professionals may be helpful in managing this patient?          Stretches, core conditioning, and PT.      Injection therapy.      Social work, PT, OT.        He wants to see a chiropractor and asks your opinion. Discuss.          Chiropractic care can help; they can often counsel patients about exercise as well.      Case #3  Shoulder Pain Case  A 43-year-old right-handed painter comes to see you complaining of gradual left shoulder pain, which began about two months ago. Lately she has had difficulty in reaching for the doorknob and lifting objects. The pain awakens her at night. The pain was preceded by an unusually heavy workload, but she did not want to turn down the jobs and feels she may have overworked herself. At the present time she is between painting jobs and is taking coated ASA on an as-necessary basis. She is on no other medication and does not have a previous history of shoulder injury.   Based on this patient’s history, what is your top 3 differential diagnosis for her shoulder pain?          Rotator Cuff Disease.      Arthritis.      Shoulder instability.        Physical Exam Findings  On examination of the left shoulder, there is normal bulk, tone, and strength present distally in the arm and sensation is intact. Pain is increased by resisted external rotation and abduction of the left shoulder. There are tender points just anterior and distal to the tip of the acromion of left shoulder. The left trapezius is also tender compared to the right. There is restricted active range of movement with internal rotation limited to 45° and abduction limited in active range to 90° with a painful arc present. Passive ROM is reasonably full with slight limitation related to pain.  Based on the physical exam findings, what is the most likely diagnosis? What is the significance of the restricted range of motion?          Rotator Cuff Disease.      The restricted active RoM and the normal passive RoM suggest that there’s no joint issue, but there is a soft tissue problem.      Pain with abduction (supraspinatus) and external rotation (infraspinatus) further suggests a rotator cuff issue. Same with the positive painful arc sign.        Design a practical treatment approach for this patient.          Physiotherapy → strengthening the shoulder joint.      Activity modification → don’t do things that make the shoulder hurt.      Pain management → NSAIDs.      If 12 weeks of conservative Tx fails, injections and surgery can be considered.                  Surgical modalities include subacromial decompression, or RC repair if there’s any cuff tearing.                      If her findings had been the same except for diffuse active andpassive ROM restriction, most notably on external rotation, whatwould be the most likely diagnosis?          Arthritis, since both the passive RoM and active RoM are affected, suggesting a joint issue.      Case #4  Thigh Pain Case  A 57-year-old woman presents with pain in the left thigh area. The pain has been coming on gradually and although she had a fall two years earlier, she did not notice this pain until six months ago. The pain is made worse by walking and by climbing stairs. When arising from a period of resting, the pain and stiffness is initially worse. The pain is relieved initially by walking several steps but the pain returns after the patient has been walking for greater than five minutes. She is unable to sleep on her left side and frequently awakens with this pain. On examination, this is a healthy-appearing 57-year-old woman. The pain is reproduced by resisted abduction. Local tenderness is present over the greater trochanter of the left hip. There is decreased hip internal rotation on the left. There is a slightly antalgic gait, and a slight Trendelenberg gait. The lumbar spine is slightly restricted and painful especially with extension. There is no other wasting or weakness. Neurological exam is normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? List 3 other diagnoses you should consider.          Hip Adductor Tendonitis.      Arthritis.      Bursitis.      Referred pain from the joint above (spine) or below (knee).        What is the cause of her presentation?          Her previous fall caused her to use one side of her body more, resulting in the hip adductor tendonitis (gluteus medius, gluteus minimus).        What investigations are appropriate?          Rule out red flags → weight loss, systemic symptoms, saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder problems, etc etc.        Design a practical treatment approach.          Similar to before; PT, activity modification, ice, NSAIDs, etc.      If you suggest a cane, tell them to use it on the opposite site of the injured hip (it gives you another fulcrum on which you can put your weight).      Case #5  Knee Pain Case  A 16-year-old female presents with gradual onset (over a three-month period) of pain in the right knee, which is increased by activity, particularly by climbing stairs. She gives no history of the knee locking and has not injured it in any known way. She notes that when she is doing physical activities, such as playing volleyball, she gets pain and “cracking” when she squats. When she sits for a while and then stands, it often causes pain. On examination, this is a healthy appearing person but there is local tenderness along the medial and lateral borders of the patella. Patella grinding is present (positive patella grind test) when the patella is pressed against the femur and pain is elicited by resisted leg extension from a fully flexed position. The Q angle measures 15E bilaterally. Other aspects of examination of the knee are normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis?          Patellofemoral pain syndrome, especially considering her age.      Gradual onset, affected by activity, and there’s a positive patella grind test.        Why does the pain come on with exercise or after sitting?          During exercise, there’s knee extensor load, which exacerbates pressure in the patellofemoral joint.      After sitting, the force needed to get up and extend the knee does the same thing.        Outline the principles of management.          Conservative Tx, just like before.      Little supporting evidence for other treatment modalities.      Case #6  Knee Injury Case  A 20 year-old wide receiver comes to see you after injuring his left knee in practice about an hour ago. He tells you that during practice, he was running route drills, practicing his cuts, when he changed direction, pivoted and heard a “pop” before he suddenly collapsed on the field in pain. His teammates also said they heard a pop and helped him into your office. He does not have a history of knee injuries or instability, and is otherwise healthy and in excellent physical shape. While in the waiting room, he took 2 Advil, but is otherwise on no medications and has no known medical conditions.  Based on the history, what are your top 5 differential diagnoses for this patient?          ACL tear.      PCL tear.      MCL tear.      LCL tear.      Meniscus tear.        How can you differentiate between these diagnoses during your physical exam? What tests will be useful? Will you be able to perform them?          ACL tear → anterior drawer test, Lachman maneuver.      PCL tear → posterior drawer test, sag sign.      Lateral/Medial tear → varus/valgus stress test.      Meniscus tear → McMurray test.        Physical Exam Findings  On physical exam, the patient’s left knee is slightly swollen compared to the right. He is in significant pain, but allows you to perform several tests. Notably, there is significant anterior laxity on both the Lachman and anterior drawer. When palpating his joint line, he tells you that it is not more tender than the rest of his knee. Varus and valgus stress tests are painful but not lax. There is no sag sign and the posterior drawer is negative.  What investigations will you perform?          XR → check to see that there’s no avulsion fracture.      MRI → for ligament/cartilage damage.      CT → if MRI is not available.        Outline an acute management strategy for this patient.          P/E is suggestive of an ACL Tear.      Short term, you try to maintain the strength of the knee and prevent contractures while swelling goes down.      NSAIDs and braces can be used as well.      Surgical repair is undergone when swelling and inflammation has gone down, particular since this patient is an athlete.        *Outline a long-term management strategy for this patient. *          Post-operatively, PT is needed to strengthen the surrounding muscles, and to prevent compensatory overuse of the contralateral knee.      Case #7  Flexion Contracture Case  A 44 year-old businessman undergoes a laprascopic cholecystectomy; unfortunately, he experiences a number of complications during and after the surgery and must be admitted to the ICU. One month after his ICU admission, he has plantarflexion contractures and heel ulcers.  What are flexion contractures?          Shortening of the connective tissue of a muscle, resulting in a reduced RoM.        What are 5 risk factors for flexion contractures?          Immobility.      Injury.        What are the 3 most common flexion contractures?          The 3 most common flexion contractures are the ankle, knee, and elbow.      It’s thought that this is because the corresponding muscles cross 2 joints:                  Knee → hamstrings (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps femoris).          Ankle →          Elbow → biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis.                      What impact do flexion contractures have on patients’ functional status and return to ambulation? Provide examples for different joints.          These are common sense.        What is your management strategy for this patient?          Stretching, work on passive RoM.        How can flexion contractures be prevented in patients with known risk factors such as lengthy anticipated ICU stays?          Motility; avoid the preventable risk factors.

	{"title": "Child Health Small Groups &ndash; Limp", "text": "Lecture Objectives  By the end of the session students should be able to:          Develop a systematic method to approaching acute limb pain.      List at least 4 important factors for the diagnosis of acute limb pain.      Define Septic Arthritis and Transient Synovitis.      Define Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE).      List at least 3 common clinical manifestations of SCFE.      Describe characteristics of limb pain which would suggest child abuse.       Case #1  Case Summary  John, a 13-year-old boy, presents with a 6 day history of right sided limp. He complains of pain involving the right thigh and knee. He denies fever, a preceding illness or trauma and is otherwise in good health.   John presents with the clinical problem of new onset change in gait and pain. When taking the history from John, what additional information would be helpful in determining the cause of his limp?          OPQRST.      Associated symptoms (rashes, fever, weight loss, recent growth).      History of trauma.      Past medical history.      Family history.      Travel history.        What factors would be important in the physical examination?          Look, feel, move, special tests, neuromuscular exam, including the joint above and below.      Height and weight.      Gait assessment.      Hepatosplenomegaly.      Height, weight.        Additional Information  On examination, John looks well. Height is 158 cm and weight is 80 kg. Movement of the right hip in flexion, extension, and rotation is painful. There is no swelling or warmth. The rest of the general physical examination is normal. There is no rash or organomegaly.   Examine John’s growth chart. What do you conclude?          Height is normal (near the 50th %’ile), but his weight is significantly elevated (around the 99.9th %’ile).      In other words, he has a higher weight than expected given his height.        Body mass index (BMI) is calculated as kg/meter squared. What is John’s BMI? What do you conclude?          .      Hence, he’s obese (BMI greater than 95th %’ile)        John complains of thigh and knee pain, but the physical findings point to the right hip as the painful joint. How can you explain this?          Impingement of the obturator nerve can result in radiation to the thigh and knee.        Review the table on the next two pages. When assessing a child with a limp, what do you think would be the most important factors from the history and physical examination, to help in determining a differential diagnosis?          Acute vs. chronic.      Age of patient.      Systemic symptoms.      Painful vs. non-painful limp.        Which diagnoses do you think are likely possibilities for John? (List at least 4).Why? Which is MOST likely?          Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE).      Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.      Trauma.      Rheumatologic disorder.        What is the most common cause of hip pain in this age group? Do you think that is the case here? Why/why not?          Trauma, but this unlikely because there’s no history of trauma.      The next most common cause is SCFE.        Why might trauma still be in the differential diagnosis even if there is no history of injury?          The kid might be lying about his history.      There might also be the risk of non-accidental injury (child abuse).        What would you do next? How can the diagnosis be confirmed?          For SCFE, diagnosis is confirmed by bilateral hip radiography, which needs to include anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral views in patients with stable slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and anteroposterior and cross-table lateral views in patients with the unstable form.       On this anteroposterior pelvic view, note the increased opacity of his left metaphysis andthe subtle widening of the physis. Also note the malalignment of the proximal femur, i.e. the change in position between the femoral head and neck.  Define Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis          Fracture of the growth plate due to slippage of the epiphysis.      Non-inflammatory, results is displacement of the femoral head relative to the neck.      Occurs in the growth plate during periods of rapid growth in adolescents (age 10-14).      Risk factors include:                  Obesity.          Male gender.          Hypothyroidism.          GH deficiency.                    SCFE is classified as follows:                  Acute = &lt; 3 weeks.          Chronic = &gt; 3 weeks.          Acute/unstable = non-weight bearing.           Chronic/stable = Antalgic gait only.                      What is the etiology of this disorder?          Etiology is thought to be multifactorial; it’s more commonly seen in the obese with delayed skeletal maturation, or taller patients who recently underwent a rapid growth spurt.        Why is an x-ray taken of both hips when only one is symptomatic?          Some may have bilateral involvement already; others may soon progress to bilateral involvement.      Even if the other hip is normal, it’s useful to have a normal reference.        What are the treatment options for SCFE?          Stop weight-bearing in the interim.  – Surgical fixation.  – Possible need for late osteotomies.        What is the long-term prognosis?          Generally speaking, the prognosis is good.      However, there’s a risk of subsequent avascular necrosis and/or DJD.        If a similar history were obtained regarding a 6 year old boy (James) would another diagnosis be more likely?          Yes; it would more likely be Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease.      This is where there’s interruption of the blood supply to the femoral head, leading to AVN.      More common in boys between the ages of 3-10.      Case #2  Case Summary  Mai, a 3 year old girl, presents to the emergency department with acute onset limp and refusal to walk. Mai was well until 8 days ago when she had an upper respiratory tract infection. She had a clear nasal discharge, low-grade fever and decreased appetite for two days. Three days ago she seemed well and back to her usual self. On the day prior to this visit she awoke after her afternoon nap and refused to walk. Today she will walk if encouraged but limps and complains that it hurts.  What other information would be helpful?          OPQRST.      Associated symptoms (rashes, fever, weight loss, recent growth).      History of trauma.      Past medical history.      Family history.      Travel history.        Additional Information  Mai has previously been well. Her parents are South Korean. Mai was born in Canada. Mai’s maternal grandmother has osteoarthritis. Mai is the only child born to her parents. There is no history of trauma. She currently has no rash, has a good appetite and feels well.   What would you be looking for on physical examination?          Look, feel, move, special tests, neuromuscular exam, including the joint above and below.      Height and weight.      Gait assessment.      Hepatosplenomegaly.      Height, weight.        Additional Information  Mai is playing with her doll on the examining bed when you come to see her. She looks well and is chatty and friendly. She is sitting with her left leg flexed and externally rotated. She cooperates until you try to examine her legs at which point she cries. You examine her in her mother’s lap and determine that there is no tenderness in the ankle and knee but there is decreased range of motion in the left hip and pain with internal rotation. There is no joint swelling or redness. Mai walks a couple of steps with encouragement from her mother. Temperature is 37.4 C.   What are the most important (discriminating) features of this history and physical?          Patient age.	      Patient looks well.      Patient is improving.      Previous URTI.        What diagnoses would you consider? Are they likely? Why and/or why not? What is the most likely diagnosis          Transient monarticular synovitis/tenosynovitis.      Occult trauma.      Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis → unlikely w/o constitutional symptoms.      Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis → unlikely w/o redness or swelling.      Malignancy.      SCFE isn’t on the DDx; she’s too young.        What diagnoses would it be important to rule out?          Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.      Malignancy.      Child abuse.        What tests would help you out?          CBC-D (and white count), ESR, CRP for inflammatory/infectious causes.      X-rays.        Tests are all normal (leukocytes and ESR are only mildly elevated), X-ray is normal. What do you conclude?          Transient synovitis.        What is transient synovitis?          Self-resolving joint inflammation, with an unknown etiology.      Often preceded by a viral infection.      Common; accounts for 30% of non-traumatic limps in children.        What is the natural history of this disorder?          Resolves in 1-2 weeks with no long-term complications.        What will be the treatment plan for this girl?          Conservative treatment.      The patient should return if there are:                  Persistent symptoms past 10 days.          Worsening symptoms or systemic symptoms.                      Why must septic arthritis and osteomyelitis be considered? What factors in the history and physical would make these diagnoses more likely?          They must be considered because they’re serious, can result in long-term complications, and can spread.                  Septic arthritis → infection of the joint.          Osteomyelitis → infection of the bone.                    Factors that make these more likely include:                  High fever, markedly elevated WBC or ESR.          Severe pain and tenderness.                      Would your approach and differential diagnosis be different if Mai was 6 months old?          Transient synovitis is less likely in younger iBnfants.      Infection/trauma are more likely.        Why does trauma need to be considered? What factors in the history and physical would make this diagnosis more likely?          Risk of child abuse (NAI, non-accidental injury).      Factors that make this more likely include:                  History of trauma or atypical trauma.          Bruises of different ages.          Social/financial stressors.                    Case #3  Case Summary  Tom is a 10-month-old male infant is brought to the emergency department (ED) following a fall which occurred yesterday morning. He will no longer stand up. The parents explain that Tom was trying to run away during a game and fell down. The infant seems in obvious discomfort and is crying.   What seems inconsistent in the brief description given of the traumatic event?          10 month-olds don’t run.      It happened yesterday morning (delay in seeking medical attention).        History  Tom is the product of a full term delivery born to a 17 year old mother who is unmarried. She and the baby live with her grandmother. The 18 year old father is involved in the care of the baby. The infant’s birth weight was 3.89 kg (90%ile). The mother says that the infant is doing well but he has not yet received any immunizations. Tom does not have a family doctor. Tom was seen in the ER 2 months ago with an accidental ingestion of acetaminophen. Tom’s father was recently fired from his job.   Discuss the risk factors for child abuse and neglect that are evident from this history.          Young mother.      Child doesn’t have regular medical care.      Father has prior history of drug overdose.      Financial and psychosocial stressors.        Physical Exam  Tom is clearly in pain. Temperature is 36.8 C. There are bruises on the infant’s back, left buttock and the right thigh. There is tenderness over the right leg from the hip to the knee. The right leg looks slightly swollen. Tom will sit but will not bear weight or crawl. There is no rash or organomegaly. The diaper is soaked through.   What are the important findings in the physical exam?          Bruises in multiple locations.      Swelling and tenderness over leg.      The diaper is soaked through (suggestive of neglect).      No evidence of other causes (constitutional symptoms, etc).        An X-Ray shows a diaphyseal femoral fracture. Does this fit with the history given?          No, femur fractures in this age group are very rare, particularly since infants of this age are not ambulating.        Are there circumstances where a fall as described by the parents could result in a femoral fracture?          Probably not, unless they have some sort of bone pathology (Osteogenesis imperfecta, chronic steroid use, etc).        Are there any fractures which occur with simple falls in toddlers?          Yes; Toddler’s Fracture, spiral fracture of the distal tibia.      Metatarsal fractures are also common with simple falls.        What is the role of a physician when child abuse is suspected?          Mandatory reporting to CAS (Children’s Aid Society).        State some of the forms of abuse that a child may be subjected to.          Physical, emotional, psychological, neglect.        What factors may influence the under-reporting of child abuse by parents or otherpeople involved with the child’s care?          Denial, fear of the perpetrator, fear of retribution.      Not recognizing signs of abuse.      Not knowing how to report the abuse.      Avoiding the demands of becoming involved.      Having personal views which condone the use of physical punishment.      Not knowing that reports can be made anonymously, with no legal consequence.      Case #4  Case Summary  Yvette is an 11-year-old girl who comes to her family doctor’s office complaining of right knee pain. She limps into the office. The problem began approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain comes and goes, is worse with activity and if she bangs her knee. Yvette plays competitive soccer and is on the school basketball team. There is no history of trauma, joint swelling, rash, other affected joints, fever or malaise. Yvette has never been in hospital and has had no surgery. She is on no medication.   What diagnoses would you consider?          Osgood-Schlatter Disease      Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.      Trauma.      Rheumatologic disorder.      Slipped capital femoral epiphysis.        Physical Exam  On examination there is tenderness over the right tibial tuberosity with mild swelling. The other joints are normal. There is no rash or organomegaly. Yvette looks well. Temperature is 36.9°C   What do you think is the most likely diagnosis? Why?          Osgood-Schlatter Disease.      Most often seen in patients who actively participate in sports.        What test(s) would you order? Why?          XR, CBC-D, ESR, CRP.      We need to rule out more dangerous causes.        What is the cause of the most likely diagnosis?          Osgood–Schlatter disease (also known as apophysitis of the tibial tubercle or OSD) is an inflammation of the patellar ligament at the tibial tuberosity.      It is characterized by a painful lump just below the knee and is most often seen in young adolescents.      Risk factors include overuse (especially in sports involving running, jumping and quick changes of direction) and adolescent growth spurts.        What is the treatment of the most likely diagnosis? What is the prognosis?          Generally conservative with rest and ice.      specific exercises can be done to stretch the quads and hamstrings.      NSAIDs can be used for pain.      The prognosis is good.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/02/10/child-health-small-groups-child-limp.html"},

	{"title": "Pediatric Orthopedics I", "text": "Overview  The first lecture of the series will be podcasted.  The second lecture has some videos of patient faces, which will be edited out out of the podcast.          These videos aren’t crucial for exam purposes.        The first hour will focus on pediatric trauma.  The second hour will focus on general pediatric orthopedics.Anatomical Differences in Children  Children are NOT little adults; there are key musculoskeletal differences.  Key musculoskeletal components that differ include:          Bone is more porous and pliable.      Periosteum → soft (osteogenic) tissue that surrounds the bone.                  In children, this is thicker and more active than in adults.          It also contributes to healing; this is why children generally heal faster and better with a fracture.          However, this large periosteum can sometimes get in the way when attempting to reduce a fracture.                    Physis → aka. Growth Plate.                  Seen as cartilage at ends of long bones.          These are a site of relative weakness.          Damage to the growth plate can result in growth and growth arrest issues.                    Anatomical Terminology  Epiphysis → above the physis (growth plate).  Physis → at the growth plate.  Metaphysis → recall that this was the box around the widest part of the bone.  Diaphysis → the shaft of the bone.  Apophysis → tendon insertion sites (ie. tubercles).Pediatric MSK Trauma  Most single extremity, generally minor.  Common mechanisms include falls from low heights, sport-related injuries, pedestrians struck by vehicles, NAI (non-accidental injury, aka. child abuse) infants/toddlers, vehicle operators (kids on ATVs, snowmobiles, etc).  Differences with Pediatric Trauma:          Because children’s bone is less dense and more porous, there is less comminution due to lower energy requirements for fracture.      Physeal (growth plate) fractures are a worry in children, but not adults.      Children are less likely to get ligament damage or dislocation.        Pediatric Fracture Types:          Buckle Fracture → incomplete fracture of the shaft of a long bone, with ‘bulging’ of the cortex on one side only.      Greenstick Fracture → similar to a buckle fracture (where the fracture is incomplete), but here the bone actually cracks, and you see bending on the other side of the bone.      Plastic deformation → no fracture line is seen, but the bone has been curved due to continuous microtrauma. These require treatment, even though there’s no fracture!      Physeal injury → will be discussed later.      Physeal InjuriesSalter-Harris Classification  The Salter-Harris Classification system is used to describe damage to the physis (growth plate).          It’s not necessary to remember this, but note that higher values correspond more severe damage to the growth plate.        A useful mnemonic to help remember the classification is SALTER itself!          S → Slip (separated/straight across): fracture of the physis only.      A → Above: fracture starts above the physis (metaphysis), and travels into it.      L → Lower: fracture starts below the physis (epiphysis), and travels into it.      TE → Through Everything: fracture goes through the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis.      R → Rammed: the growth plate is crushed.        Salter Mnemonic for Salter-Harris Classification      S → Slip (separated/straight across): fracture of the physis only.    A → Above: fracture starts above the physis (metaphysis), and travels into it.    L → Lower: fracture starts below the physis (epiphysis), and travels into it.    TE → Through Everything: fracture goes through the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis.    R → Rammed: the growth plate is crushed.

	{"title": "Approach to the Hip", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Develop approach to MSK problems in the upper leg  What is the origin of the problem; pelvis, hip, thigh(soft tissue), back or intra-abdominal.  Discuss investigation, treatment to the most common problems.Review of Hip Anatomy  The medial femoral circumflex artery is what feeds the neck of the femur.  If you devascularize this, you put the patient at a high risk of avascular necrosis.  Innervation to the thigh:          The sciatic nerve innervates the posterior compartment.      The obturator nerve innervates the medial compartment.      The femoral nerve innervates the anterior compartment.        Recall that the femoral and obturator nerves only function above the knee, while the sciatic goes below the knee.  Recall that the sciatic nerve branches into the (1) tibial nerve, and (2) common fibular nerve (aka. peroneal nerve).          Branching of the sciatic nerve is highly variable.      It can divide above/at/below the piriformis muscle.      Differential Diagnosis for Hip Pain  Referred Pain from another System:          From Lumbar Spine → lumbar spinal stenosis, radiculopathy, myofascial/mechanical irritation, fractures.      From the Knee → internal derangement, musculature.

	{"title": "PCCM Week 1 &ndash; Upper Limb", "text": "Approach to the MSK Exam  The MSK exam is organized as follows:          Look      Feel      Move      Special Tests      Neuromuscular Screen        To remember the things you look for, use the SEADS mnemonic:          S → Symmetry (or swelling).      E → Erythema.      A → Atrophy.      D → Deformities.      S → Scars.        When you’re feeling the area of interest, describe the surface anatomy, and any joints you feel.          Name everything you touch.      Work proximally to distally.        The neuromuscular screen involves looking at muscle bulk, tone, power, and symptom provocation:          Bulk → is the muscle bulk symmetric or asymmetric?      Tone → resistance to passive movement (spasticity, rigidity, flaccidity).                  Increased tone is seen with upper motor neuron problems.          Decreased tone is seen with lower motor neuron problems.                    Power → resistance with active movement.      Symptom provocation → is there pain with muscle contraction?        MRC (Medical Research Council) Grades for Power:          0 = No contractions.      1 = Muscle flickers.      2 = Muscle movement without gravity.      3 = Muscle movement against gravity only.      4 = Reduced power.      5 = Full power.      The Shoulder ExamLook  SEADS.  In particular, look at the shoulder from the posterior, and look for wasting of the supraspinatus or infraspinatus (hollowing out above or below the spine of the scapula).Feel  Start from the sternum, move along the clavicle, and feel both anterior and posterior landmarks.  Again, look for muscle wasting of the rotator cuff muscles (Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, etc).Move  Start with active movement, and ONLY do passive movement if there’s a problem with the active movement.          Flexion → have the patient bring their arms forward and above their head.      Extension → have the patient bring their arms backward.      Abduction/adduction → have the patient bring their arms out and back in.      Internal/external rotation → have the patient bring their elbows to their side, with their hands up. Have them move their arms out and back in.      Special Tests  Special tests for the shoulder assess 3 things:          Ligament Impingement      Ligament Irritation      Ligament Tears.        Tests for Ligament Impingement          Neer’s Test                  The examiner moves the arm through the full range of forward flexion or until reports of pain.          The sign is positive if there is pain with flexion.          See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8-yLHQ_JaM.                    Hawkins Kennedy Test                  The examiner places the patient’s arm shoulder in 90 degrees of shoulder flexion with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and then internally rotates the arm.          The test is considered to be positive if the patient experiences pain with internal rotation          See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LU1xsUrKV4                    Painful Arc Test                  Have the patient abduct their arms in the plane of the scapula. The test is positive when there’s pain between 60 and 120 degrees of elevation (where the space between the humerus and the acromion is minimal, exacerbating impingement).          Note that unlike the Neer’s Test and the Hawkin’s Kennedy test, this is active, and not passive.                      Tests for Ligament Irritation          Supraspinatus Tendon                  This is assessed via the Empty Can Test.          See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjHOqydDhxo.          The test is positive when there’s pain when pressure is applied.                    Infraspinatus Tendon                   Bring the patient’s elbows to their sides, and have their hands facing outwards.          Push their arms in and have them resist.          This strains the infraspinatus since it’s an external rotator of the shoulder.          The test is positive if this elicits pain.                    Teres Minor                   This is the same test as with the infraspinatus, except in this case, have the patient’s arms up.          Again, bring the patient’s arms inwards, and have them resist.          The test is positive if this elicits pain.                    Subscapularis                   This ligament is somewhat more difficult to assess because it’s a medial rotator of the humerus.          To assess it, have the patient put their hands on their belly, and try to pull their arms away from their stomach.          Again, the test is positive if this elicits pain.                      Tests for Ligament Tears          Supraspinatus Tendon                  Since the supraspinatus is a shoulder abductor, passively abduct the patient’s arms for them, and then let go.          If there’s a supraspinatus tear, their arm will drop.          Hence, this is known as the Dropped arm test.                    Infraspinatus Tendon                  Here, passively externally rotate the patient’s arms with their elbows to their side.          When you release their arms, since the infraspinatus (an external rotator) is no longer there, the patient’s arms will slowly move medially.          This is known as a Lag Sign.                    Teres Minor                   This is another lag sign similar to the one with the infraspinatus tendon.          Here, passively move the patient’s arm to a position similar to the one where we assessed for ligament irritation.          When you release their arms, the patient’s arms will internally rotate such that their hands are in front of their mouth.          Hence this is known as the Hornblower’s Sign.                      Summary of the Shoulder Exam      Look → SEADS.    Feel    Move              Flexion/Extension.        Abduction/Adduction.        Internal/External Rotation.              Special Tests              Ligament Impingement:                      Neer’s Test            Hawkins Kennedy Test            Painful Arc Test                          Ligament Irritation:                      Supraspinatus (Empty Can Test)            Infraspinatus (arms down)            Teres Minor (arms up)            Subscapularis (hands on belly)                          Ligament Tears:                      Supraspinatus (Dropped Arm sign)            Infraspinatus (arms down + lag sign)            Teres Minor (arms up + lag sign; aka. the Hornblower’s sign)                              The Elbow ExamLook  SEADS.  Also look at the carrying angle: the angle at which the forearm attaches to the arm.          Normally, we all have a degree of valgus (the forearm normally attaches at an outward angle to the arm), and this is more prominent in women than in men.      It’s pathological when the angle is greater than 15°, or less than 5°.      Cubitus Valgus → where the joint angle exceeds 15°.      Cubitus Varus → where the joint angle is less than 5°. Also referred to as a Gunstock Deformity.        You can also look for the Popeye Sign (Vince!), which is suggestive of a tear of the biceps tendon          With the Popeye sign, because the biceps tendon is torn, the biceps muscle will clump up and look exaggerated (just like Popeye’s guns).      Feel  Feel the following structures:          Lateral epicondyle.      Medial epicondyle.      Olecranon.      Triangular Space.      Musculotendinous origins (the tendons of the muscles as they attach to the epicondyles).      Move  Start with active movement, and ONLY do passive movement if there’s a problem with the active movement.          Flexion (N = 150°)      Extension (N = 0°, ie. the arm is completely flat)      Supination (palms up).      Pronation (palms down).        To remember which direction is supination, imagine a poor boy holding his hands up for soup (soup = supination).Special Tests  Tests for Epicondylitis          Lateral Epidondylitis                  For these 2 tests, palpate the LATERAL EPICONDYLE, and have the patient’s palms FACING DOWN.          Perform the following:                          Resisted Wrist Extension (Cozen’s Test).              Passive Wrist Flexion (Mill’s Test).                                Either of the above signs is positive if there’s associated pain.          These tests rely on the fact that the forearm extensor muscles originate at the lateral epicondyle.                    Medial Epicondylitis                  For these 2 tests, palpate the MEDIAL EPICONDYLE, and have the patient’s palms FACING UP.          Perform the following:                          Passive Wrist Extension (no fancy name).              Resisted Wrist Flexion (Reverse Mill’s Test).                                These tests rely on the fact that the forearm flexor muscles originate at the medial epicondyle.                      Varus/Valgus Stress Tests          Have the patient supinated for the following tests.      Valgus Test                  Put one hand on the lateral side of the elbow, and use the other to push the forearm laterally.          This strains the ulnar (medial) collateral ligament.                    Varus Test                  Put one hand on the medial side of the elbow, and use the other to push the forearm medially.          This strains the radial (lateral) collateral ligament.                      Neurologic Tests          Tinel’s Sign → tap over the median nerve to see if it elicits pain.      Neuromuscular Tests  Assess muscle bulk, tone, power, and symptom provocation, as mentioned before.  Assess reflexes (triceps C6,7,8, biceps C5,6, and brachioradialis C5,6).  Summary of the Elbow Exam      Look → SEADS, carrying angle (varus/valgus).    Feel:              Lateral and medial epicondyle.        Olecranon.        Triangular space.        Musculotendinous origins.              Move              Flexion (N = 150°)        Extension (N = 0°)        Supination/Pronation.              Special Tests              Epicondylitis:                      Lateral Epicondylitis (feel lateral epicondyle, palms down):                              Resisted wrist extension (Cozen’s Test)                Passive wrist flexion (Mill’s Test)                                      Medial Epicondylitis (feel medial epicondyle, palms up):                              Passive wrist extension                Resisted wrist flexion (Reverse Mill’s Test)                                                    Varus/Valgus Stress Tests:                      Varus test → strain lateral ligament.            Valgus test → strain medial ligament.                          Neurologic Tests:                      Tinel’s Sign.                                Neuromuscular Tests              Muscle bulk, tone, power, and symptom provocation.        Assess reflexes (biceps, triceps, brachioradialis).            The Wrist ExamLook  SEADS  Nail changes, changes in hair distribution (may be suggestive of a vascular issue).Feel  Feel for all the bony landmarks (Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, Hamate).          Recall the mnemonic ‘Some Lovers Try Positions That They Can’t Handle’.        Feel for all the joints.Move  Wrist movements → flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, supination, pronation.  Finger movements (excluding little finger) → flexion, extension, adduction, abduction.  Thumb movements → flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, opposition.  Little finger movements → flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, opposition.Special Tests  Finkelstein’s Test          The examinar ulnar deviates the wrist (straining the radial side of the wrist).       If sharp pain occurs at the distal radius, then this is suggestive of De Quervain’s Tenosynovitis.        Tinel’s Sign          The examiner taps on the Carpal Tunnel to try to elicit median nerve irritation.      Pain is suggestive of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.        Phalen’s Test           Have the patient bring their wrists together in forced flexion (as shown to the right).      This increases the pressure in the carpal tunnel, and can also exacerbate irritation to the median nerve.      The test is positive if this elicits characteristic signs of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (such as burning, tingling or numb sensation over the thumb, index, and middle fingers).        Summary of the Wrist Exam      Look → SEADS, nail changes, changes in hair distribution.    Feel → bones, joints.    Move → (1) wrist, (2) fingers, (3) thumb, (4) little finger.              Make sure you include opposition for the thumb and little finger.

	{"title": "Fractures Small Group", "text": "Case #1  Shoulder Dislocation  A 22 year-old university student comes to the Emergency Room after injuring his right shoulder in an intramural hockey game. On questioning, he tells you that he felt his shoulder go “pop” when he was hit hard from behind into the boards while reaching for the puck with his arm outstretched. He had to have help getting out of his equipment because he couldn’t move his arm, and was in extreme pain,, so he decided to come to the ER. On physical exam, there is a large bulge in the anterior shoulder, and the right arm slightly abducted and externally rotated. Passive range of motion of the shoulder is limited. The sensory neurologic exam of the left arm is normal. Pulses are present at the radial and brachial arteries.   What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?          Anterior Shoulder Dislocation.      Anterior dislocations are the most common, since there’s no bony protection (eg. the scapula).      Posterior dislocations are comparatively rare, unless caused by the 3 E’s:                  Epilepsy          Electric Shock          Ethanol                    Note that a separated shoulder ≠ a dislocated shoulder:                  Separated shoulder → AC joint dislocation          Dislocated shoulder → glenohumeral joint dislocation.                      What investigations should you do?          X-Ray, minimum 2 orthogonal views.        Patient X-Rays  Note that the humerus is disconnected from the glenoid cavity. Hence this is an anterior shoulder dislocation.  What is your initial management plan for this patient?          Reduction of the shoulder:                  You should do a full neurological exam both before and after the reduction.          This lets you know whether you caused any neurological problems, or if they were originally there.                    X-rays pre- and post- reduction                  This lets you know whether the reduction was effective or not.                      How would you reduce an anterior dislocation?          Many different methods; manipulation is more important than brute force.      Often the patient is supine, and external and rotation is applied to pop it back in.      Sometimes, when the patient is sedated and there’s reduced muscle tone, the shoulder will just pop back in.        What are your instructions for the patient at discharge?          Warn the patient of the risk of recurrence, particularly if they’re younger.      Put the patient in a shoulder sling for 1-3 weeks to prevent short-term dislocation.        What are indications for referral in the management of this patient?          Acute Indications → nerve or vessel problems, patient is an athlete, failure to reduce the shoulder.       Long-term Indications → multiple dislocations in the past.        What is the prognosis for this patient with respect to recovery and chance of recurrence?          The younger you are (&lt;20), the more likely you are to have a repeat dislocation.      Poor compliance with PT, or early return to work, also increases risk.      PT focuses on proprioception; it’s thought that this helps stabilize the shoulder and prevent recurrence.      Case #2  Wrist Fracture  A 51 year-old electrician comes into the emergency room complaining of severe wrist pain. A few hours ago, on her way home from school, she slipped on the stairs of her house and fell onto her outstretched hand. She tells you that she is in severe pain that has been unremitting since the fall. She tried icing her wrist but when she couldn’t bend her wrist decided she should come to the ER. On physical exam, her wrist is swollen and she refuses to move it because of the pain. There is a dinner-fork type deformity. Her neurovascular exam distal to the deformity is normal.   Patient X-Rays  Note the dinner fork deformity, shown in red.  Based on this patient’s presentation, what is your differential diagnosis?          Wrist Fracture → especially with a ‘dinner-fork deformity’.                  Dinner fork deformity → where the back of the arm isn’t straight, but actually dips and curves a bit (like the back of a dinner fork).                    Scaphoid Fracture.      Soft Tissue Injury.        What is your initial management plan for this patient?          X-rays, minimum 2 views.        Describe the x-ray.          Shown is a PA and lateral film of the right distal radius.      On the PA view, I see a communited distal radius, with radial shortening, and a decrease in radial angulation.      On the lateral film, I again see a distal radius fracture, extra-articular involvement, with dorsal angulation and radial shortening.      We know that there’s radial shortening because the ulna looks to be longer than the radius here. Normally, the radius is longer, so we know that shortening must have occurred.        What is your management plan?          Reduction, and casting.                  In this case, a circumferential, well-molded cast, is needed in order to maintain the reduction.                    Post-reduction X-rays.      Refer to orthopedics.        What are the most common complications of a distal radius fracture?          Nerve injury.      Compartment syndrome, if the cast is too tight.      Loss of reduction, if the cast is too loose.      Malunion → where healing occurs in the wrong position.      Wrist Stiffness → due to prolonged stasis of the wrist.        Post Reduction X-Rays  Post-reduction X-rays suggest that the fracture has been effectively reduced. There's no more dorsal angulation, the relative lengths of the radius and ulna are normal again, and there's no more 'dinner fork' deformity.Case #3  Hip Fracture  A 75 year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her grandson after falling down the steps of a restaurant. She tells you that she is in excruciating pain that started after she fell. You obtain details of the fall from the patient and her grandson and determine that: she missed a step going down approximately 5 stairs and landed on her left lateral hip; she did not lose consciousness before or after the fall; she did not hit her head; she tried to break her fall with her hands; her grandson and another restaurant patron helped her to her car; she does not have a history of previous falls or steroid use.   What are the most important initial steps in managing this patient?          Vitals.      Analgesics.      Hx and P/E, especially a neurologic exam.        What is your differential diagnosis for this patient’s presentation?          Femoral neck fracture → confirmed on XR.      Pubic rami fracture      Inter-trochanteric fracture.        What do you expect to find on physical exam for each of these potential diagnoses?          Inability to walk.      Pain with movement of the hip.      Inter-trochanteric may have bruising on skin.      One leg will be straight, the other will be flexed and externally rotated to maximize space in pelvic joint!?        What investigations will you order?          CT Scan to r/o occult fracture (eg. non-displaced hip fracture).                  In cases where no fracture is seen, but the clinical history is suggestive of one.                      How will you manage this patient?          Casting actually increases morbidity with hip fractures, because the stasis increases comorbidities, eg. DVT.      So the first choice here is SURGERY as opposed to casting.      DVT prophylaxis is needed.      Rehab, social support, etc.        Femoral neck fractures, high risk of ABN due to poor vascularization.  Bipolar hemi-arthroplasty -&gt; bipolar = two surfaces, hemi-arthroplasty, acetabulum still same~?  Look this up.Case #4  Ankle Fracture  A 42 year-old lawyer comes to the emergency room after injuring his right ankle while hiking with his kids. Several bystanders helped him off the trail and drove him to your ER. His ankle is bleeding and there is a laceration approximately 3cm long on the anteromedial aspect of the leg above the medial malleolus.  The patient’s vitals are HR 95, BP 138/75, and temperature 37°C. As beforeCHeck neurologic SxVitalsAnalgesiaOpen fracture.Antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxisTake out debris in wound -&gt; debridement and irrigationSHOWS FRACTURE OF BOTH LATERAL AND MEDIAL MALLEOLUS. TALUS HAS SLIGHTLY SHIFTED LATERALLY BECAUSE THE MEDIAL MALLEOLUS HAS COME OFF.  What is your initial management plan for this patient?  What investigations, if any, will you order?          Ankle X-Rays      Left is AP, right is lateral, middle is ‘mortise view’. Part of ankle series.      Visualizes the joint surface nicely.      Like with shoulder, always axillary view, ankle, always mortise view.        What are signs and symptoms of neurologic or vascular compromise you must watch for?          Pain that’s worsening and out of proportion with injury (eg. compartment injury).      Worsening numbness.      Skin discoloration.      Ecchymoses/swelling.        What are complications of open fractures?          Infection, both bone (osteomyelitis), or soft tissue infection (skin, soft tissue abcess).      Open fractures are surgical emergencies; surgery is always done to wash out wound.      Show picture of repaired.Case #5  Salter-Harris Fracture  A 10 year-old boy is carried by his father into the emergency room after the boy fell off of a trampoline while jumping with friends. Both are in obvious distress, and the boy is crying and unable to walk. His right leg is swollen around the ankle and distal tibia, but the skin is intact.  Salter-Harris Fracture → fracture of the growth plate.          With child, the growth plates are the weakest area of the bone.      So if you have a fracture, it’ll most likely propagate into the growth plate.                  Describe the x-ray.                    Fracture of the distal tibia, see fracture, goes into growth plate, exits. NOT THE GROWTH PLATE.      Growth plate has natural undulation; younger the patient, the wider the growth plate.                  What is the Salter-Harris classification of fractures? What is its use?                    I – S = Slip (separated or straight across). Fracture of the cartilage of the physis (growth plate)- Physis only. Often hard to see since it overlaps with the growth plate, so often a clinical diagnosis.II – A = Above. The fracture lies above the physis, or Away from the joint.- Fracture of physis and metaphysis.III – L = Lower. The fracture is below the physis in the epiphysis.- Fracture through physis and epiphysis.IV – TE = Through Everything. The fracture is through the metaphysis, physis, and epiphysis.- Fracture through the physis, epiphysis, and metaphysis.V – R = Rammed (crushed). The physis has been crushed.- Compression of the growth plate.Fractures closer to the growth plate will correct better over time. Better the growth potential.SALTER MnemonicS = slip, A = above, L = lower, TE = through everything, R = rammed.  What is your management strategy for this patient?  Repititious, analgesics, splints, reduction if required, pre- and post- neuro, pre- and post- XR, refer to ortho.  Complication of any growth plate fracture is physeal arrest (growth plate no longer grows; affects growth potential).  Hence needs referral to peds ortho.Case #6  Femure Fracture  A 30 year-old man is referred to you, the medical student in the emergency department, after being cleared by the trauma team for an isolated femur fracture following a motor vehicle accident. He has been given analgesia and his pain is reasonably controlled. He has a swollen thigh that is obviously deformed. His distal neurovascular exam is normal.  Describe the x-ray.          Laterally displaced diaphyseal femur fracture.        What is your initial management?          Same with everything else, but also check hemodynamic instability.      Routine vitals, routine Hb, see ortho right away.        Patients with femur fractures need to be treated surgically as soon as possible. Why?          Lots of blood supply IN YOUR FEMUR, so risk of significant blood loss.      Possible compartment syndrome due to fluid leakage.      DVT, PE, fat emboli at risk.      Faster surgery, faster mobilization, reduced complications.      Intramedullary nail inserted as Tx.

Location → where is the fracture located on the bone.          Diaphysis → bone shaft.      Metaphysis → widening of the bone; defined as the square around the end of the bone with width equal to the widest part of the bone.      Epiphysis → rounded end of bone, at the joint.        Fracture Pattern:          Transverse      Comminution → more than 2 bone pieces. Usually seen with high energy fractures.                   If the amount of energy in the fracture doesn’t match the history, suspect a pathologic bone issue.                    Spiral → rotational force around the limb.      Oblique        Displacement          By convention, describe the distal fragment relative to the proximal one.                  Since the proximal fragment is considered the ‘stable’ one, the distal fragment is described relative to it.          For example, ‘anterior dislocation of the fracture’ means that the distal fragment is dislocated anteriorly relative to the proximal one.                    Angulation → in degrees.

Restore Anatomy:	- Length, alignment, rotation, translation.2. Allow Early Motion:	- Avoid stiffness.3. Avoid Complications:	- Interruption of fracture healing.	- Stimulation of fracture healing where needed.  The management of fractures isn’t difficult → it’s been around for thousands of years.  Surgical approaches will often differ depending on the soft tissue and bone problem.  Decide on whether you’re aiming for primary or secondary bone healing:          Primary  → bone remodelling occurs as if it was never broken.                  Here, the normal bone biology is uninterrupted, and remodelling occurs right over the fracture.          Never seen without surgical intervention.                    Secondary → multistage inflammatory mediated healing process.                  The majority of fracture healing.                      Bone heals without a scar.  Secondary healing is faster, primary healing gives you better functional result.          Hence, for joint injuries, primary healing is the goal.      With bone fractures, we often use secondary healing instead.      Primary Bone Healing.- Simple osteon remodelling.- Requires:	- Anatomic reduction → put the bones within a milimetre of each other!	- ABSOLUTE STABILITY.	- Occurs only with surgery.	- No fracture callus, unlike with secondary healing.- As a tip, you can usually tell if primary healing is the intent if you see screws inserted on the radiograph; you need the screws to approximate the fracture appropriately.Secondary Bone Healing.- Inflammatory process.- Callus is always seen → as opposed to growing over the fracture, the bone grows around it.	- Over time, the callus will slowly disappear, although you’ll still see the fracture line across the bone. (DOUBLE CHECK).- Seen both without surgery and with surgery.- Relative stability -&gt; still see a LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT ACROSS THE FRACTURE SITE.- Here, you’re NOT SQUEEZING THE BONES TOGETHER; you’re stabilizing them, but not forcefully approximating them.Step 1: Obtain a reduction.- Closed (internal)- Open.Listen later.Step 2: Maintain the reduction:- Casts, braces- Plates and screws- Intramedullary nails- External fixatorsStep 3: Rehabilitation- Early motion- Protected weightbearing- Physiotherapy- Occupational therapyClassification of Open Fractures (ie.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Forearm", "text": "Introduction  Arm → shoulder to elbow.  Forearm → elbow to wrist.  The forearm is split into 2 compartments, just like the arm.          Anterior Compartment → involved in flexion of the wrist, and (some) pronation.                  Almost all of the muscles of the anterior compartment are innervated by the median nerve (C5,6,7,8 T1)                    Posterior Compartment → involved in extension of the wrist, and supination.                  Innervated by the radial nerve (C5,6,7,8 T1).                      The ulna is always medial to the radius, in terms of orientation.          When we pronate or supinate our arm, the ulna remains fixed, while the radius moves over top it.      A. Bones of the Forearm  Interosseous Membrane: separates the anterior and posterior compartments. Made of connective tissue, increasing the rigidity of ulna and radius together.  Head of Ulna/Radius  Styloid Process of Radius  Styloid Process of Ulna  Ulnar Notch  Distal Radioulnar Joint  Proximal Radioulnar Joint  Clinical Note: The styloid process of radius is more distal than that of ulna. However, if there’s a fracture of either the radius or the ulna, then the relative positions of the two styloid processes can shift.B. Elbow Joint  Radial Annular Ligament → the radial head pivots within the annular ligament axis during movements of pronation and supination  Medial (Ulnar) Collateral Ligament.  Lateral (Radial) Collateral Ligament.  Tendon Bicep Brachii.  Olecranon Bursa → The olecranon bursa lies between the olecranon and the skin; inflammation of this is colloquially known as Student’s elbow (students spend lots of time resting on their elbows).C. Anterior Muscles of the Forearm  Innervation → median nerve (with a few exceptions).  Function → flexion and pronation.  Blood Supply → the radial and ulnar arteries (          Recall that the brachial artery branches into a radial and ulnar branch at the level of the forearm.        Broadly speaking, the anterior muscles of the forearm are classified into:          Superficial layer.      Middle layer.      Deep layer.      Superficial Muscles  4 main muscles comprise the superficial layer of anterior muscles:          Pronator teres      Flexor carpi radialis      Flexor carpi ulnaris      Palmaris longus.        Pronator teres is a wrist pronator; the rest are wrist flexors.  All are innervated by the median nerve except the flexor carpi ulnaris, which is innervated by the ulnar nerve.  The superficial muscles share a common attachment; the medial epicondyle. This is known as the common flexor origin (CFO).  The bicipital aponeurosis covers the heads of these superficial muscles.1. Pronator Teres  O → medial EPICONDYLE of humerus and CORONOID process of ulna   I → middle lateral surface of RADIUS   A → PRONATES and FLEXES forearm at elbow   N → MEDIAN NERVE (C7,8)  Notes:          This is the only anterior superficial muscle that is not a wrist flexor (doesn’t cross the wrist).      Since it attaches on the medial side of the humerus, and then crosses laterally to the radius, when it contracts, it pronates the arm.      2. Flexor Carpi Radialis  O → medial EPICONDYLE of humerus   I → base of 2nd METACARPAL   A → FLEXES and ABDUCTS the hand at wrist   N → MEDIAN NERVE (C7,8)  Notes:          From the name (flexor carpi radialis), it flexes the wrist from the radial side.      Since it attaches to the side of the hand, it doesn’t result in true flexion, but rather radial deviation (ie. abduction).      3. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris  O: Differs depending on the head:          Humeral Head: medial EPICONDYLE      Ulnar Head: OLECRANON and post. ULNA         I → PISIFORM, HAMATE and 5th METACARPAL   A → FLEXES and ADDUCTS hand at wrist   N → ULNAR NERVE (C8).  Notes:          This is analogous to the flexor carpi radialis, except that it attaches to the other side of the hand.      Hence, it results in ulnar deviation (adduction).      Note that this was an exception to the rule that all anterior muscles are innervated by the medial nerve; it’s innervated by the ulnar nerve (this makes sense; it has ulnaris in it’s name).      4. Palmaris Longus  O → medial EPICONDYLE   I → distal FLEXOR RETINACULUM and PALMAR APONEUROSIS   A → weak FLEXOR and TIGHTENS PALMAR aponeurosis   N → MEDIAN NERVE(C7,8)  Notes:          Not everyone has a palmaris longus; it’s thought that primates had a more pronounced palmaris longus, so the more distantly related you are, the less likely you are to have one.      It has a small belly and a long tendon, which then attaches to the palmar aponeurosis.      Flexor Retinaculum: the band of connective tissue at wrist which prevents bow stringing of tendons of the wrist      Palmar Aponeurosis: sheet of connective tissue over the palm of hand that helps provide structural support      Middle Muscle1. Flexor Digitorum Superficialis  This is the only muscle of the middle layer.  O → Depends on the head:          Humeroulnar Head: medial EPICONDYLE of humerus (CFO), CORONOID process of ulna, ulnar COLLATERAL LIGAMENT       Radial Head: superior anterior RADIUS.        I → MIDDLE PHALANGES (2-5)   A → FLEXES MIDDLE PHALANGES at proximal interphalangeal joints (4 fingers).  N → MEDIAN NERVE (C7,8)  Notes:          Just like all of the other anterior muscles, this has an origin at the medial epicondyle.      The tendons of these muscles insert into the middle phalanges of the 4 fingers.      However, before they get there, they split (like a snake’s tongue).      The reason for this is that the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus (a deeper muscle) actually go further, into the distal phalanges.      As a result, the superficial tendons have to split in order to let the deep tendons get by.      Deep Muscles  3 main muscles comprise the deep layer of anterior muscles:          Flexor Digitorum Profundus      Flexor Pollicus Longus      Pronator Quadratus        Like most of the other anterior muscles, these are innervated by the median nerve. However, the deep muscles in particular are innervated by a particular branch of the median nerve, the anterior interosseus branch.  Unlike most of the other anterior muscles, these don’t originate at the medial epicondyle.1. Flexor Digitorum Profundus  O → proximal medial anterior ULNA and INTEROSSEUS membrane   I → distal phalanges 2-5 (deep is distant!!!)   A → FLEXES distal phalanges at distal interphalangeal joint (2-5)   I → this is the 2nd exception (in addition to the flexor carpi ulnaris) to the median nerve innervation rule; only part of it is innervated by a branch of the median:          Medial Part: ULNAR NERVE      Ulnar Part: anterior interosseus branch of MEDIAN NERVE        Notes → as mentioned previously, the tendons of the profundus muscle run past the tendons of the superficialis where they split.2. Flexor Pollicus Longus  O → anterior RADIUS and INTEROSSEUS membrane   I → DISTAL PHALANX of thumb   A → FLEXES THUMB   N → anterior interosseus branch of MEDIAN NERVE.  Notes: flexion of the thumb is where you bring it across your palm. Pollicus = thumb.3. Pronator Quadratus  O → anterior ULNA.  I → anterior RADIUS.  A → PRONATES forearm.   N → anterior interosseus branch of MEDIAN NERVE  Notes: this is the second anterior muscle that isn’t a flexor; the pronator quadratus, along with the pronator teres, are the two pronators of the arm.Summary of Anterior Muscles of the Forearm                   Origin      Insertion      Action      Innervation            SUPERFICIAL LAYER          Pronator Teres      Medial epicondyle (CFO)      Lateral radius      Wrist pronation      Median nerve              Flexor Carpi Radialis      Medial epicondyle (CFO)      Lateral hand (base of 2nd metacarpal)      Flexion and radial deviation (abduction) of wrist      Median nerve              Flexor Carpi Ulnaris                          Humeral head: Medial epicondyle (CFO)          Short head: Olecranon                  Medial hand (pisiform, hamate, 5th metacarsal)      Flexion and ulnar deviation (adduction) of wrist      Ulnar nerve              Palmaris longus      Medial Epicondyle (CFO)      Palmar aponeurosus and flexor retinaculum      Weak flexor; tightens palmar aponeurosis      Median Nerve        MIDDLE LAYER          Flexor Digitorum Superficialis                        Humeroulnar Head: Medial epicondyle (CFO)          Radial Head: Superior anterior radius                    Middle phalanges      Flexion at the middle phalanges      Median Nerve        DEEP LAYER          Flexor Digitorum Profundus      Proximal medial anterior ulna and interosseus membrane       Distal phalanges      Flexion at the distal phalanges                        Medial part: Ulnar nerve          Ulnar part: Anterior interosseus nerve (branch of median)                            Flexor Pollicus Longus      Proximal medial anterior ulna and interosseus membrane       Distal phalynx of thumb      Flexion of the thumb      Anterior interosseus nerve (branch of median)              Pronator Quadratus      Anterior ulna      Anterior radius      Wrist pronation      Anterior interosseus nerve (branch of median)      D. Posterior Muscles of the Forearm  Innervation → ALL via the radial nerve.          More specifically, this is via a specific branch of the radial nerve: the posterior interosseus branch (with 1 exception).      Contrast this with the anterior interosseus branch off the median nerve, which innervates the deep muscles of the anterior compartment.        Function → extension and supination.  Blood Supply → the posterior interosseus artery          Recall that this was a branch of the common interosseus, which came off the ulnar artery.        Broadly speaking, the posterior muscles of the forearm are classified into:          Superficial layer.      Deep layer.        There’s no middle layer like with the anterior muscles!Superficial MusclesUsually, when you see a brevis and longus muscle, the longus one will actually be smaller than the brevis one. The longus and brevis refers to the length of the tendon, not the size of the muscle.  5 main muscles comprise the superficial layer of posterior muscles:          Extensor Carpi Ulnaris      Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus      Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis      Extensor Digitorum      Extensor Digiti Minimi.        The superficial muscles share a common attachment; the lateral epicondyle. This is known as the common extensor origin (CEO).          Irritation of the lateral epicondyle due to extensor action is colloquially known as Tennis Elbow.      1. Extensor Carpi Ulnaris  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus  I → base of 5th metacarpal  A → Extends and Adducts hand at wrist  N → Posterior Interosseus branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)  Notes: This is the extensor analag to the flexor carpi ulnaris in the anterior compartment.2. Extensor Digiti Minimi  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus  I → Proximal phalanx of 5th digit (pinky)  A → Extends wrist and 5th digit (pinky)  N → Posterior Interosseus branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)  Notes: as the name suggests, this extends the little finger (digiti minimi).3. Extensor Digitorum  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus  I → Extensor Expansion of medial 4 digits  A → Extends fingers at metacarpalphalangeal joints and Extends hand at wrist  N → Posterior Interosseus branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)  Notes:          Unlike the anterior compartment, where there was both a flexor digitorum superficialis and a flexor digitorum profundus, there’s only one muscle that controls digit extension.      The tendons of the extensor digitorum are interconnected; this makes it harder to independently extend the fingers (unlike with the flexor digitorum muscles).      4. Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus  I → Base of 3rd metacarpal  A → Extends and Abducts hand at wrist  N → Posterior Interosseus (Deep branch) of Radial Nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)  Notes: Note that there are 2 muscles that extend and adduct the wrist, and only 1 (flexor carpi radialis) that flex and adduct it.5. Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus  O → Lateral supracondyle ridge of humerus  I → Base of 2nd metacarpal  A → Extends and Abducts hand at wrist  N → Radial Nerve (C6)   Notes: This is an exception to the rule that all the posterior compartment muscles are innervated by the posterior interosseus branch of the radial.          Since it originates higher on the humerus, it actually gets innervation from the radial nerve itself before it gives off the posterior interosseus branch.      Deep Muscles  5 main muscles comprise the deep layer of the posterior muscles:          Supinator      Abductor Pollicus Longus      Extensor Pollicus Longus      Extensor Pollicus Brevis      Extensor Indicis        Since there are extra muscles attaching to the index finger and pinky (the extensor indicis and extensor digiti minimi respectively), they have more independent movement than the other fingers.  The thumb itself has a number of muscles attaching to it, so it can also easily move independently.  These muscles come out from under the superficial muscles, so they’re often referred to as the outcropping group.1. Supinator  O → lateral EPICONDYLE of humerus, RADIAL COLLATERAL and ANNULAR LIGAMENTS, SUPINATOR FOSSA, and CREST OF ULNA  I → lateral, posterior, and anterior of proximal radius  A → Supinates forearm  N → Posterior Interosseus branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)   Notes → opposes the action of the pronators (pronator teres, pronator quadratus).2. Abductor Pollicis Longus*  O → posterior surface of ULNA, RADIUS, INTEROSSEOUS MEMBRANE  I → base of 1st metacarpal  A → Abducts thumb and extends carpo-metacarpal joints  N → Posterior Interosseus branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)   Notes → Thumb abduction involves sticking your thumb out (thumbs up), and not just moving it away from the palm.3. Extensor Pollicis Longus*  O → posterior middle ULNA and INTEROSSEOUS MEMBRANE  I → base of DISTAL PHALANX of thumb  A → Extends thumb at carpometacarpal and interphalangeal joints  N → Posterior Interosseus branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1) 4. Extensor Pollicis Brevis*  O → posterior RADIUS and INTEROSSEOUS MEMBRANE  I → base of PROXIMAL PHALANX of thumb  A → Extends proximal phalanx at carpometacarpala joint  N → Posterior Interosseus branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1) 5. Extensor Indicis  O → posterior ULNA and INTEROSSEOUS MEMBRANE  I → Extensor expansion of 2nd Digit  A → Extends index finger and extends hand  N → Posterior Interosseus branch of radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1)   Notes → allows the index finger to have extension independent of the extensor digitorum (which is why you can point).*: These muscles comprise the anatomical snuffbox:  Extensor policus longus.

Ulnar nerve = flexor carpi ulnarus and half of flexor digitorum profundus.    Radial nerve = all posterior forearm muscles (most as the posterior interosseus nerve branch).  E. Anterior Compartment Arteries  Brachial artery branches into radial (lateral) and ulnar (medial)          Both supply the anterior compartment.        The 2 arteries form arches in the palm:          The ulnar artery forms the superficial palmar arch.      The radial artery forms the deep palmar arch.      The two anastamose with one another to provide dual circulation.        The common interosseous artery branches off the ulnar artery, and branches further into anterior interosseous artery and posterior interosseous artery.          The common interosseus aptly runs between the radius and ulna.      The anterior interosseus and posterior interosseus arteries run anterior and posterior to the interosseus membranes respectively.      This is important because the only blood supply to the posterior forearm is through this posterior interosseus artery.        Finally, radial and ulnar recurrents come back up the arm and anastamose with the ulnar collaterals we saw in the previous lecture.          As mentioned before, this helps maintain circulation to the elbow joint.      F. Components of the ForearmG. Carpal Tunnel  Guyon’s Canal → small canal that carries the ulnar artery and ulnar nerve.          Between palmar carpal ligament (superficial), flexor retinaculum and hypothenar muscles (deep), pisiform and pisohamate ligament (medial), and hook of hamate (lateral).        Carpal Tunnel → the carpal bones of the wrist are concave with respect to the palmar side, creating a space through which the carpal tunnel runs.          The superficial side is covered by the flexor retinaculum to create tunnel.      Contents of carpal tunnel (1 nerve, 9 tendons):                  Median Nerve          Flexor Pollicis Longus Tendon          Flexor Digitorum Profundus (4 tendons)          Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (4 tendons)                      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome → median nerve entrapment neuropathy that causes paresthesia, pain, numbness and other symptoms in the distribution of the median nerve due to compression of the carpal tunnelH. Colle’s Fracture  Colle’s Fracture → fracture of the distal radius (distal neck) with dorsal (posterior) and radial displacement of the wrist and hand  Is described as a bayonet or dinner fork configuration of the bones.  Often associated with osteoporosis.  It is due to a trauma which hyperextends the wrist.  Smith’s Fractures – similar to Colle’s fracture but it is due to a hyperflexion of the wrist.  Can result in damage to median nerve either via hematoma in the carpal tunnel, hyperextension at the time of trauma, or direct injury.  Scaphoid Fractures can also be associated with this.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/23/anatomy-forearm.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Arm", "text": "Introduction  Arm → shoulder to elbow.  Forearm → elbow to wrist.  The arm, like the forearm, is split into 2 compartments.          Anterior Compartment → involved in flexion of the shoulder and elbow, and supination.                  Innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7).                    Posterior Compartment → involved in extension of the shoulder and elbow.                  Innervated by the radial nerve (C5,6,7,8 T1).                      In the lateral arm runs the cephalic vein; in the medial arm runs the basilic vein.A. Bones of the Arm  Lateral Epicondyle  Medial Epicondyle  Olecranon Process of Ulna  Olecranon Fossa  Coronoid Fossa  Radial Fossa  Coronoid Process of Ulna  Capitulum Trochlea  Radial Tuberosity  Ulnar Tuberosity  Greater Tubercle  Lesser Tubercle  Head of humerus  Bicipital Groove  Deltoid TuberosityB. Anterior Arm Muscles  The 3 muscles of the anterior compartment comprise of:          Biceps Brachii (aka. biceps)      Brachialis      Coracobrachialis        All of them are supplied by the brachial artery.  All of them are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve.          Note that the musculocutaneous nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment, and then continues as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm and provides sensory innervation.      Since it innervates the muscles, and then the cutaneous forearm, it’s aptly referred to as the musculocutaneous nerve.        In addition to these 3 muscles, there’s another ‘pseudo’ anterior arm muscle called the brachioradialis muscle.          This muscle is located in the anterior compartment, but is innervated like a posterior compartment muscle (ie. by the radial nerve).      1. Biceps Brachii  O: Differs depending on the head:          Short Head: CORACOID process of scapula.      Long Head: SUPRAGLENOID tubercle of scapula/glenoid labrum.        I → RADIAL TUBEROSITY.   A → Supinates forearm (major) and flexes elbow   N → Musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7)  Clinical → the long tendon ruptures easily with trauma in the elderly; tapping the biceps tendon briskly elicits the biceps jerk tendon reflex to check C5/C6 spinal cord levels.  Blood Supply → Brachial artery and branches.  Notes:           In the arm, the median nerve is most medial, then the brachial artery, and then the biceps brachii is most lateral.      A sheet-like tendon near the base of the biceps called the bicipital aponeurosis protects the brachial artery and median nerve as they continue into the forearm.      2. Brachialis  O → Distal anterior humerus.  I → CORONOID process of ULNAR TUBEROSITY   A → MAJOR flexor of forearm (thumbs up), flexes forearm in all positions.  N → Musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7) and radial nerve.  Notes:          Note that this attaches to the ulnar tuberosity as opposed to the radial tuberosity.      Hence, the biceps brachii attaches to the radial tuberosity, and the brachialis attaches to the ulnar tuberosity.      3. Coracobrachialis  O → CORACOID process of scapula   I → Medial HUMERUS   A → Weak flexor and adducts arm   N → Musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7)  Notes:          Small muscle; does not cross the elbow (starts from the coracoid, and only goes to the medial humerus). As a result, it only flexes the arm at the glenohumeral joint.      Good landmark for the musculocutaneous nerve, because you can see the nerve pierce the muscle!      4. Brachioradialis  O → Proximal lateral SUPRACONDYLAR ridge of humerus   I → lateral surface of distal RADIUS (styloid process).  A → FLEXES the forearm   N → Radial nerve (C5,6,7)  Clinical → tapping elicits the brachioradialis jerk tendon reflex used to test for C5, C6, and C7 spinal cord levels  Notes:          Not really an anterior arm muscle, since it’s innervated by the radial nerve, as opposed to the musculocutaneous nerve.      Forms the bulk of the lateral side of your forearm.      Good landmark to distinguish between the anterior and posterior compartments.      Since it crosses the elbow, it does elbow flexion.      It’s strongest when the radius is upwards (the muscle is least stretched), so it’s used most when in a ‘hammering’ or ‘drinking’ position.      Hence it’s known as the drinking or thumbs-up muscle.      5. Summary of Anterior Arm Muscles  The biceps brachii crosses both the shoulder and elbow so it can flex both.  The brachialis and brachioradialis only cross the elbow so they only flex the elbow.          Since the brachialis attaches to the ulnar tuberosity, and the brachioradialis attaches to the distal radius, they’re stronger in different positions.        The coracobrachialis only crosses the shoulder, so it only flexes the shoulder (and adducts it).

Posterior Arm Muscles1. Triceps  O → varies for each of the 3 heads (hence tri-ceps):          Long Head: INFRAGLENOID TUBERCLE of scapula      Medial Head: posterior surface of HUMERUS BELOW radial groove      Lateral Head: posterior surface of HUMERUS ABOVE radial groove         I → proximal OLECRANON process and FOREARM FASCIA via triceps tendon  A → MAJOR extensor of forearm and shoulder  N → Radial nerve (C5,6,7,8, T1)  Blood Supply → profunda brachial artery and branches.  Clinical → tapping triceps tendon used to elicit the triceps jerk tendon reflex to test C7 and C8.  Notes:            The radial nerve runs along a groove on the posterior humerus; this is the radial groove (aka. spiral groove).                  The lateral head attaches above this groove; the medial head attaches below it.                    The long head of the triceps runs between the teres major and teres minor.      The lateral head of the triceps merges with the long head to form the triceps tendon. This then attaches to the olecranon of the elbow.      Between the long head and the lateral head lies the muscle’s blood supply and innervation: the radial nerve and profunda brachii artery.        Reflex Testing Nerve Roots      Biceps reflex → C5,6. (C5,6 pick-up sticks)    Brachioradialis reflex → C6.    Triceps reflex → C7,8 (C7,8, lay them straight).  D. Arterial Supply of the Arm  Subclavian → Axillary → Brachial → Ulnar/Radial Arteries.  The axillary artery becomes the brachial artery past the lower border of the teres major.  Brachial Artery Branches:          Profunda Brachii → recall that this supplies triceps.      Superior Ulnar Collateral      Inferior Ulnar Collateral      Ulnar Artery (medial)      Radial Artery (lateral)        The superior and inferior ulnar collaterals anastamose with ascending recurrent branches to help maintain blood flow to the elbow.  Musculocuntaneous nerve usually pierces coracobrachialis.  Brachial artery can be injured with midshaft or supracondylar fractures of the humerus.  Median nerve is medial to brachial artery near elbow.  Ulnar nerve passes behind the medial epicondyle (Funny Bone); more severe injury can lead to claw hand deformity and numbness.

Know the Health Canada guidelines for exercise prescription for muscular strength and endurance.  Objective      Review the basic physiology of skeletal muscle activation.    Neural signals travel from the brain, down through the spinal cord, and into peripheral nerves.  Skeletal muscle activation requires the activation of both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons.          Upper Motor Neuron → Brain &amp; Spinal Cord.      Lower Motor Neuron → the nerves that innervate muscles.        Problems with either can affect muscle activation:          Upper Motor Neuron → stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury.      Lower Motor Neuron → Anterior horn cell disease, peripheral nerve injury, neuromuscular junction disease, muscle/myopathy.        Objective      Review the concept of the motor unit and its role as the functional unit in skeletal muscle contraction.    A motor unit is made up of a motor neuron and the skeletal muscle fibers innervated by that motor neuron’s axonal terminals.          Hence, they’re the main functional unit behind a muscle contraction.        Groups of motor units often work together to coordinate the contractions of a single muscle; all of the motor units within a muscle are considered a motor pool.  A motor unit consists of the following:          Anterior horn cell in the ventral horn of spinal cord      Ventral Root      Myelinated Axon      Neuromuscular Junction      Muscle Fibers      Types of Motor Units  Very broadly speaking, motor units as classified as either Type I, and Type II:  Type I           These have muscle fibres that are involved in low-intensity exercise (walking, standing up, etc), and mainly involve slow-twitch muscle fibres.      These are also smaller motor units, as thus comprise a smaller proportion of the muscle mass.      Metabolically speaking, they are designed to do things for a long period of time (high aerobic endurance, well vascularized, etc).        Type II          Used only with higher intensity exercise, as these require higher intensity contractions to activate.      These are larger, and have a higher force-generating potential.       However, metabolically, they have more glycolysis relative to oxidative phosphorylation.        Hence, the idea behind strngth-training is to use high intensity contractions in order to engage our larger, higher-threshold, fast-twitch motor units.          With disuse, or aging, we have less engagement of these fast-twitch motor units, so we have muscle atrophy.        Objective      Know the different types of skeletal muscle contraction.    Isometric → muscle stays same length  Concentric → muscle shortens longitudinally.  Eccentric → muscle lengthens longitudinally.  Objective      Know the impact of disuse and other forms of injury on skeletal muscle.    Disuse atrophy is commonly seen in clinical practice, and is based on the idea that ‘if you don’t use it, you lose it’.  Commonly seen with:          Immobilization of a joint (casting)      Bed Rest/immobility      Pain (reflex inhibition) → this reduces muscle activation around the site of injury.      Non-weight bearing → for instance, patients in wheelchairs, or astronauts.        One significant study in the impact of disuse was the Dallas Bed Rest Study (1966):          In the study, they put healthy university students in bed-rest for 4-6 weeks with a controlled diet..      Over 2 weeks, found that their muscle strength decreased by 25-40%, with significant decreases in power, endurance, RoM, and balance.      Hence, nowadays, we encourage early mobilization and exercise; this is a substantial shift from historical views that bed rest is better.        Objective      Understand the physiological adaptations that occur in skeletal muscle as a result of resistance exercise.  Muscular Changes with Training  Studied by DeLorme (1945), who popularized the idea of Progressive Resistance Exercise (PRE).  The idea here is to gradually expose the muscle to higher resistance; this increased muscle mass and strength.          In other words, modern-day strength training.        Delorme Axiom (used in most modern-day exercise regimens):          High intensity, low repetition exercise increases strength (8 – 12 repetitions)      Low intensity, high repetition exercise increases endurance (&gt; 15).      This lead to the principle of progressive overload.        How does the muscle change with exercise?          Resistance training results in increased muscle fibre size (25-35%) → in other words, hypertrophy.                  Most of this change is from the Type II muscle fibres (particularly IIA); Type I fibres do not change in size significantly.                    However, there’s less convincing evidence that an increase in fibre number occurs, ie. hyperplasia.                  In other words, your fibres do get bigger, but you probably don’t develop more of them with training.                    This suggests that you’re limited by the amount of muscle fibres you’re genetically endowned with, ie. a genetic potential.        Remember      Resistance training increases muscle fibre size, but it probably does not increase muscle fibre number.    Do you have to ‘injure’ muscle for it to grow?          It’s commonly thought that you have to damage the muscle during training in order to allow it to regrow larger and stronger.      This does play a small role in hypertrophy:                  Muscle injury results in satellite cell activation and proliferation.          These cells then get incorporated into the muscle, increasing muscle size.                    However, it likely does not contribute significantly; most of your increase in strength is due to an increase in the amount of contractile protein (actin, myosin).      Neuromuscular Adaptations to Training  Increases in muscle mass are not the only changes that occur with exercise.  Broadly speaking, we can increase force production in 2 ways:          Increase Central Activation → increase the percent of our muscle mass that’s used.      Increase Total Muscle Mass → increase the amount of muscle mass that’s available to be used, ie. hypertrophy.        Although must people think of #2 when they think of strengthening muscle, in rehab, it’s actually #1 that’s most important:          For instance, in patients with a hip replacement, where rehab is over weeks as opposed to years, the change in function is more due to ‘relearning how to use your muscles’, as opposed to gaining significant amounts of new muscle.        In fact, it’s thought that a significant amount of your early improvement in strength is due to improvements in your muscle recruitment:          “The initial increases in strength on progressive resistance exercise occurs at a rate far greater than can be accounted for by morphological changes within muscle” (De Lorme and Watkins 1951).        As a corollary, free weights often give you faster results than machine training:          This is because the nervous system has to adjust more to the use of free weights as opposed to with a machine.      With free weights, you have to learn how to stabilize etc, which is not necessary with the machine.      So in general, people will improve in strength more quickly with compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, etc) that involve multiple muscle groups.        Objective      Appreciate the role of therapeutic exercise in the prevention and rehabilitation of those with musculoskeletal disorders.    Exercise is extremely important in maintaining health:          Other than smoking cessation, physical inactivity is the most important modifiable risk factor in reducing CV disease and stroke.      However, about 60% of Canadians are not active enough to reap health benefits, and just over 50% of Canadians exercise more than 15 minutes per week.        Exercise has been shown to play a role in the following:          Reducing premature (early) death.      Reducing risk of diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, some cancers, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and depression.      Reduces risk factors for disease, such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.      Improves physical fitness, such as aerobic capacity, and muscle strength and endurance.      Improves functional capacity (the ability to engage in activities needed for daily living).      Improves mental health, such as depression and cognitive function.      Decreases injuries or sudden heart attacks.        Are there cases when you shouldn’t exercise?          Generally, these are fairly rare, but there are scenarios where exercise is counter-productive:                  Acute Muscle Inflammation → actively inflammed muscle will respond poorly to exercise.          Active Inflammatory Joint Disease/Tendonitis.          Systemic Illness → eg. if you have the flu, exercise may exacerbate your illness.          Nutritionally Deficient          Strength Less than Anti-Gravity → ie, you’re so weak due to a progressive nerve/muscle problem, that you can’t even resist gravity.                          If they’re that weak, then doing more with that muscle group probably won’t help.              Attempts at preservation are more effective than recovery.                                            Objective      Review basic concepts of exercise prescription for healthy populations.    Basic Principles of Exercise Prescription          Specificity → specific adapations will occur with specific training interventions (eg. swimming vs. strength training).      Progressive Overload → you have to progressively expose the system to greater stress in order to improve.      Adequate rest and recovery      Detraining → ie, you have to use it or you’ll lose it.        Tips for Exercise Prescription:          Give them SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:      Make sure they know:                  What type of activity are they going to do? → eg. swimming, walking.          How often will they do it? → eg. 3 times a week.          For how long will they do it? → eg. 20 minutes.          How hard will they do it? → eg. 50% of max heart rate.                    To compute the max heart rate, use:                  .          50% of your max heart rate is what’s usually suggested.          Another handy tip is to ‘get to where you’re almost out of breath, but not’.                      Objective      Know the Health Canada guidelines for exercise prescription for muscular strength and endurance.    Health Canada uses the ACSM Guidelines (American College of Sports Medicine).  These are as follows:  Resistance Exercise          8 to 10 exercises involving all major muscle groups      8 - 12 repetitions maximum per set      Minimum of 1 set per exercise      20 minutes vs 60 minutes for three sets, decreases drop‐out rate.        Aerobic Exercise          150 minutes of moderate activity per week      Brisk walking, cycling at moderate pace        For more information, see the following:          http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/paguide.pdf.

	{"title": "The Brachial Plexus", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe walls of axilla, it’s contents and identify cords relativeto axillary artery.  Describe the organization of the brachial plexus from root toterminal branches  Identify the nerve supply of all muscle compartments of theupper extremity and map the sensory distribution provided bythe brachial plexus  Differentiate clinically between superior and inferior brachialplexus (i.e., median, radial and ulnar nerves).The Axilla  Axilla → the armpit.  The walls of the axilla are defined as follows:          Anterior → pectoralis major and minor.      Posterior → subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi.      Medial → serratus anterior.      Lateral → Biceps brachii, coracobrachialis.        The epicentre of the axilla is the axillary artery.          The positions of all other structures are defined relative to the axillary artery.      For instance, the cords of the brachial plexus (medial, lateral, posterior) are named for their positions relative to this artery.        Note that the axillary artery is a continuation of the subclavian artery, and continues into the brachial artery.          Before passing the clavicle, the vessel is known as the subclavian artery.      After this, but before passing the lower border of the teres major, it’s then known as the axillary artery.      After this, it’s known as the brachial artery.        Remember      Subclavian Artery → Before passing the clavicle.    Axillary Artery → Between the clavicle and the lower border of the teres major.    Brachial Artery → After the lower border of the teres major.    The axillary artery is contained within the axillary sheath:          The axillary sheath contains:                  Cords of the Brachial Plexus → posterior, middle, and lateral cords.          Axillary Artery.          Axillary Vein.                    As mentioned before, the names of the cords of the brachial plexus are derived from their position relative to the axillary artery (eg. the posterior cord is behind the axillary artery).      The axillary sheath is surrounded by both axillary fat and axillary lymph nodes, which drain the upper limb and 75% of the breast lymph.                  Recall that this was important during breast examinations, because a significant amount of breast cancers would spread to the axillary lymph nodes.                      At the level of the axillary sheath, there are 2 important branches that come off the medial and lateral cord respectively:          Lateral Pectoral Nerve, which comes off of the lateral cord (obviously).                  This travels along the upper margin of the pectoralis minor, innervates it, and then travels to the pectoralis major and innervates that as well.                    Medial Pectoral Nerve, which comes off of the medial cord.                  This pierces the pectoralis minor and then supplies the pectoralis major.                    The Brachial Plexus  The Brachial plexus is an important network of nerves because it innervates the arm.  Damage to different parts of the brachial plexus will result in different, distinctive physical findings.  To describe the branching pattern of the brachial plexus, it’s generally broken down into (1) roots, (2) trunks, (3) divisions, (4) cords, and (5) branches/nerves.          In other words, we look at the nerves as they emerge from their spinal roots, combine to form trunks, split to form divisions, combine to form cords, and finally split off into branches.        To remember this, use the following mnemonic:          Really Thirsty? Drink Cold Beer! (Roots, Trunks, Divisions, Cords, Branches).        Remember      The brachial plexus is divided into:              Roots        Trunks        Divisions        Cords        Branches              Remember this as REALLY THIRSTY? DRINK COLD BEER!  1. Roots  There are 5 spinal nerve roots which form the brachial plexus, C5-T1.          More specifically, these are the ventral rami of each spinal nerve (recall that all plexuses are formed from ventral rami).        In other words, C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 (recall that there are 7 cervical vertebrae, but 8 cervical nerves).          Sometimes C4 can contribute as well → this is known as a pre-fixed (high) brachial plexus (C4-C8).      Similarly, sometimes T2 can contribute → this is known as a post-fixed (low) brachial plexus (C6-T2).        Since these are spinal nerve roots, they’re located paravertebrally.  Two important nerve branches come off at the level of the roots:          Dorsal Scapular Nerve → comes off of C5, and goes on to innervate the levator scapulae, rhomboid minor, and rhomboid major.      Long Thoracic Nerve → comes off of C5, C6, and C7, and travels behind the brachial plexus. It innervates the serratus anterior.      2. Trunks  These 5 nerve roots combine to form 3 trunks, a superior, middle, and inferior trunk:          Superior Trunk → comprised of C5 and C6.      Middle Trunk → comprised of C7.      Inferior Trunk → comprised of C8 and T1.        It’s easy to remember which nerve roots connect to which trunks; the first 2 connect to the superior one, the 3rd connects to the middle, and the last 2 connect to the inferior one.  This merging occurs as these nerves pass through the scalene muscles of the neck → hence these are described as having an interscalene distribution.  At the level of the trunks, there is 1 important branch that comes out:          Suprascapular Nerve, which comes off of the superior cord.                  This is easy to remember → ‘supra’-scapular, and superior cord.          Recall that the suprascapular nerve goes through the suprascapular notch, and then goes on to innervate the supraspinatus and infraspinatus.                    3. Divisions  Each trunk of the brachial plexus gives rise to an anterior and a posterior division.          That is, from the 3 trunks (superior, middle, and inferior), we end up with 6 divisions (each one splits into an anterior and posterior division).        This division occurs around the level of the subclavian artery.  No nerve branches are given off from the divisions.4. Cords  These 6 divisions then merge to produce 3 cords.          Lateral Cord → comprised of the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks.      Posterior Cord → comprised of the 3 posterior divisions from each of the 3 trunks (superior, middle, and inferior).      Medial Cord → comprised of the anterior division of the inferior trunk only.        These were the 3 cords that we mentioned were present in the axilla (in the axillary sheath).          Hence, just like how the subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery past the 1st rib, the divisions become cords.        As mentioned before, the medial pectoral nerve comes off of the medial cord, and the lateral pectoral nerve comes off of the lateral cord.5. Branches/Nerves  The cords split and merge in such a way that 5 branches are created.  These branches are:          Median Nerve → takes contributions from both the lateral and medial cord.      Ulnar Nerve → comes off the medial cord only.      Musculocutaneous Nerve → comes off the &lt;/i&gt;lateral cord&lt;/i&gt; only, and innervates the coracobrachialis muscle.                  In the cadavers, you can actually see the nerve go into the coracobrachialis.                    Axillary Nerve → comes off of the posterior cord, reflects upwards, and then supplies the deltoid and teres minor.      Radial Nerve → also comes off of the posterior cord.        Because of how the nerves arise, an ‘M’ is formed:          The medial nerve is the ‘middle’ of the M.      The ulnar nerve and musculocutaneous nerves are the sides of the M.      The contributions from the lateral and medial root to the median nerve form the ‘angled parts’ of the M.      This has been highlighted below:      Note the 'M' formed by the medial nerve, ulnar nerve, and musculocutaneous nerve.Main Components of The Brachial Plexus            Roots      Trunks      Divisions      Cords      Branches                        	      	  C5		  C6		  C7		  C8		  T1      	                  	      	  Superior		  Middle		  Inferior      	                  	      	  Anterior Superior    	  Posterior Superior    	  Anterior Middle    	  Posterior Middle    	  Anterior Posterior    	  Posterior Posterior      	                  	      	  Lateral		  Posterior		  Medial      	                  	      	  Musculocutaneous Nerve		  Ulnar Nerve		  Median Nerve		  Axillary Nerve		  Radial Nerve      	            This can be remembered as 5-3-6-3-5 &rarr; the number of components in each forms a palindromeAdditional Branches of the Brachial Plexus  In addition to the main branches listed above, there are smaller branches that come off of the brachial plexus at many of the levels (some of which have been mentioned before):  Branches off the Roots          Dorsal Scapular Nerve → innervates the 3 superficial muscles that attach to the medial margin of the scapula (levator scapulae, rhomboid minor, rhomboid major).      Long Thoracic Nerve → innervates the serratus anterior.        Branches off the Trunks          Suprascapular Nerve → innervates the supra- and infraspinatus.        Branches off the Divisions          As mentioned before, there are no branches off the divisions of the brachial plexus.        Branches off the Cords          Medial Cord:                  Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Arm (aka. medial brachial cutaneous nerve).          Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Forearm (aka. medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve).          Medial Pectoral Nerve                    Posterior Cord:                  Upper subscapular nerve → innervates the subscapularis.          Lower subscapular nerve → innervates the teres major and part of the subscapularis.          Thoracodorsal nerve → innervates the latissimus dorsi.                    Lateral Cord:                  Lateral pectoral nerve.                      The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm and forearm are often merged at the level of the cords. In addition, since they’re very close to the ulnar nerve, they’re often mistaken for the ulnar nerve (as part of the ‘M’).Summary of the Brachial PlexusBranches off of the Cords of the Brachial PlexusCombining the 'main branches', and the 'ancillary branches', these are all the nerves that come off of each cord:            Medial Cord      Posterior Cord      Lateral Cord                        	      	  Ulnar Nerve		  Medial Root of the Median Nerve		  Medial Pectoral Nerve		  Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Arm		  Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Forearm      	                  	      	  Radial Nerve		  Axillary Nerve		  Upper Subscapular Nerve		  Lower Subscapular Nerve		  Thoracodorsal Nerve      	                  	      	  Lateral Pectoral Nerve    	  Lateral Root of the Median Nerve    	  Musculocutaneous Nerve      	            To remember the branches of the lateral cord, you can use the Lucy Loves Me mnemonic.  Below is a memory tip to help quickly remember the nerve roots that form each nerve.          Assign each of your fingers to one of the nerve roots of the brachial plexus as follows: C5 = thumb, C6 = index, C7 = middle, C8 = ring, T1 = pinky.        Then, the mnemonics for the nerve roots that comprise each nerve are as follows:          5 mice → the median nerve has all 5 nerve roots, hence ‘5’ ‘M’ice.      5 rats → the radial nerve nerve has all 5 nerve roots as well, hence ‘5’ ‘R’ats.      Assassinated → the Axillary nerve has C5 and C6, hence it forms a gun when you point the corresponding fingers.      3 musketeers → the musculocutaneous nerve has C5,6,7, which correspond to the first 3 fingers.      2 unicorns → the ulnar nerve has C8 and T1, which correspond to the last 2 fingers.      Distribution of the Brachial Plexus  The roots come off paravertebrally.  They merge into trunks as they pass between the scalenus medius and scalenus anterior (ie. interscalene).          Recall that the scalenes comprise of the scalenus anterior, medius, and posterior; the brachial plexus passes between the first 2.      Note that the phrenic nerve (C3,4,5 keeps the diaphragm alive) passes anterior to the brachial plexus, as it’s in front of the scalenus anterior.        These trunks split into divisions at the level of the subclavian.  These divisons merge into cords at the level of the axilla.  These cords split into branches at the level of the arm (brachial).  *Injuries to the brachial plexus are classified as either supraclavicular or subclavicular:          Supraclavicular injuries affect either the roots or the trunks.      Subclavicular injuries affect the divisions, cords, or branches.      Arteries of the Axilla  As we mentioned previously, the axillary artery is just a continuation of the subclavian artery once it crosses the clavicle (and before it passes the teres major, where it becomes the brachial artery).            Recall that the left subclavian artery branches off the aortic arch directly, while the right subclavian artery comes off of the brachiocephalic (innominate) artery.      This makes sense intuitively: since the heart isn’t centred (it’s closer to the left), the right common carotid and right subclavian have to travel further, and hence they’re merged when coming off of the aortic root.        Before the subclavian becomes the axillary artery however, it gives off the thyrocervical trunk, which then splits into 3 branches:          Inferior Thyroid Artery → as we saw in ENT, this supplies the thyroid, along with the superior thyroid artery (the first branch off the external carotid).      Superficial Cervical Artery      Suprascapular Artery → this corresponds with the suprascapular nerve that came off of the superior trunk of the brachial plexus.        The axillary artery is often split into 3 parts based on its location relative to the pectoralis minor:          Part 1 → Proximal to Pectoralis minor (before it crosses the pec minor).      Part 2 → Posterior to Pectoralis minor (as it runs behind pec minor).      Part 3 → Distal to Pectoralis minor (as it goes beyond pec minor).        The utility of this classification scheme is that not only helps you remember the branches of the axillary artery, but also their location.          Part 1 has 1 major branch:                  Superior Thoracic Artery                    Part 2 has 2 major branches:                  Thoracoacromial Artery          Lateral Thoracic Artery                    Part 3 has 3 major branches:                  Posterior Circumflex Humeral Artery          Anterior Circumflex Humeral Artery          Subscapular Artery                      The thoracoacromial artery further splits into 4 branches to supply the surrounding muscles: pectoral, acromial, clavicular, and deltoid branches.  The lateral thoracic artery runs with the long thoracic nerve, which we saw came off of the roots of the brachial plexus, and innervated the serratus anterior.          Hence, it makes sense that the lateral thoracic artery feeds the serratus anterior, since it runs with the nerve that innervates it.        The posterior circumflex humeral artery and anterior circumflex humeral artery are named as such because they wrap around the surgical neck of the humerus.  The subscapular artery continues as the thoracodorsal artery, once it gives off the circumflex scapular artery:          The thoracodorsal artery feeds the latissimus dorsi, just like how the thoracodorsal nerve innervates it.      The circumflex scapular artery runs through the triangular space which we discussed in Anatomy of the Shoulder.      Branches of the Axillary ArteryCombining the 'main branches', and the 'ancillary branches', these are all the nerves that come off of each cord:            Before Pec Minor      Behind Pec Minor      After Pec Minor                        	      	  Superior Thoracic Artery      	                  	      	  Thoracoacromial Artery		  Lateral Thoracic Artery      	                  	      	  Subscapular Artery      	  Anterior Circumflex Humeral Artery      	  Posterior Circumflex Humeral Artery      	            To remember the number of branches, note that 'Part 1' has 1 branch, 'Part 2' has 2 branches, and 'Part 3' has 3 branches.To remember the names of the branches, use the Screw The Lawyer's, Save A Patient mnemonic (Superior Thoracic, Thoracoacromial, Lateral Thoracic, Subscapular, Anterior Circumflex Humeral, Posterior Circumflex Humeral.Clinical Findings with Brachial Plexus Injuries  Upper Plexus Injury          Results in Erb-Duchenne Palsy.      Erb-Duchenne Palsy typically arises when someone is thrown off of a horse or motorcycle, and lands on the ground on the side of their neck. It’s also commonly caused with shoulder dystocia with macrosomic babies.      These injuries forcibly pull the head apart from the shoulder, which stretches the upper parts ot the brachial plexus, namely C5 and C6.      This results in the following:                  Loss of shoulder abduction (deltoid), since it’s innervated by the axillary nerve, which arises from C5 and C6.          Loss of lateral rotation of arm (infraspinatus), since it’s innervated from the suprascapular nerve, which comes off the superior trunk (off C5 and C6).          Loss of elbow flexion and supination (biceps brachii and brachialis) which are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve.                          Recall that the musculocutaneous nerve comes off the lateral cord, which comes off the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks, which come off of C5, C6, and C7.                                          The sum total of all these effects is a waiter’s-tip deformity:                  Since the arm can’t laterally rotate, flex, supinate, or abduct, it stays close to the body, with the wrist pronated.          There may also be loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the shoulder, arm and lateral forearm.                      Radial Nerve Injury:          Results in a wrist drop, since the radial nerve innervates the extrinsic extensors of the wrist.      Without the action of the extensors, the wrist is flexed.        Ulnar Nerve Injury:          Results in a ulnar claw, aka. Klumpke’s paralysis.        Medial Nerve Injury:          Results in a Hand of Benediction sign when you try to make a fist.      The medial nerve plays a role in flexion of the thumb, index finder, and half of the middle finger, so when it’s damaged, they can’t be flexed with the other fingers.

Understand treatment options for 3 common shoulder disorders.          Instability → seen in younger patients.      Rotator Cuff Disease → seen in middle-aged patients.      Arthritis → seen in old patients.        Common Shoulder Disorders      Instability → seen in younger patients.    Rotator Cuff Disease → seen in middle-aged patients.    Arthritis → seen in old patients.  Shoulder Instability  Shoulder Instability → the inability to keep the humeral head centered within the glenoid cavity.          This can be seen on the right: the glenoid fossa is not adjacent to the head of the humerus, so the joint is dislocated.        Classifying Shoulder Instability:          Onset → was there associated trauma?                  In other words, was it traumatic, or atraumatic?                    Direction → anterior, posterior, inferior, or some combination of these.      Degree of instability → subluxation vs. dislocation.                  Subluxation → incomplete/partial dislocation.                      Broadly speaking, shoulder instability is classified as either traumatic or atraumatic.          Traumatic shoulder instability is seen after a trauma, ie. it’s ‘torn loose’.      Atraumatic shoulder instability is due to some sort of inherent weakness of the joint, ie. it’s ‘born loose’.        Atraumatic instability is often associated with connective tissue disorders.Traumatic vs. Atraumatic Shoulder Instability            Traumatic      Atraumatic                        	      	  Unidirectional		  Anterior &gt;&gt; Posterior		  'Torn loose'		  Surgery is often required      	            				  Multidirectional		  'Born loose'		  Primary treatment is rehab		  Surgery is uncommon		              Anatomic Factors that play a role in shoulder instability include:          Ligaments → tearing or stretching of the ligaments around the glenohumeral joint.      Labrum → if this is torn, it weakens the connection between the humerus and glenoid cavity.      Bones      Rotator cuff/muscle forces.      Nerves      Traumatic Instability  Management of Shoulder Dislocation:            X-rays → again, taken before and after the reduction.      Neurologic Exam → this is done before and after reduction to ensure that there’s (1) no nerve issue beforehand, and that (2) you didn’t cause a new nerve issue.      Reduction → this usually involves manipulation of the joint until it ‘pops’ back in, with a counter-traction applied via a sheet to facilitate this movement.        Long-term Treatment:          If you’re a younger patient (&lt;20), the treatment of choice is a surgical repair, because of the high risk of recurrent dislocations.      Furthermore, recurrent dislocations predisposes patients to arthritis.      If you’re an older patient, surgery is not suggested, since there’s a lower risk of recurrent dislocations (typically joints get less flexible as we age).        Surgical Treatment Options:          Capsule-Labral Repair → done if the labrum has torn off.      Bone defect reconstruction → done if there’s a Hill Sach’s Lesion:                  Hill Sachs lesion → a dent at the back of the humeral head that occurs when the shoulder dislocates.          Because the head of the humerus is much softer than the glenoid fossa, it can actually get deformed when smashed against the glenoid.          This results in a Hill Sach’s lesion.                    Atraumatic Instability  One common acronym that’s used is MDI: multidirectional instability.  These are best described with the AMBRI acronym:          A → Atraumatic.      M → Multidirectional.      B → Bilateral.      R → Rehab responsive.      I → Inferior Capsular Shift rarely required.        In other words, these patients are atraumatic, and frequently have multidirectional and bilateral dislocations. The treatment of choice is rehab, but if that fails, an inferior capsule shift can be done.          Inferior capsule Shift → open laparoscopic over-sewing of stretched out glenohumeral ligaments.      This has a 70% success rate.      Rotator Cuff Disease  Rotator Cuff Disease → degeneration of the rotator cuff.          This is the most common shoulder disorder.      Has an increased prevalence with age, typical onset is in the 40’s.      Considered to be progressive.        Recall that the rotator cuff muscles were the:          Supraspinatus      Infraspinatus      Teres Minor      Subscapularis        Although these play a small role in broader motions of the shoulder (see Anatomy of the Shoulder), their primary role is the stabilize the shoulder joint.          This makes sense → these muscles are much smaller than the latissimus dorsi or pectoralis major, for instance.        Pathophysiology of Rotator Cuff Disease:          What makes the tendons of the rotator cuff weak?      Generally causes can be categorized as intrinsic to the tendon, extrinsic to the tendon, or a combination of the two.      Intrinsic Causes → factors intrinsic to the tendon.                  Decreased tendon vascularity.          Tension overload → long-term tendon use strains them.          Tendon degeneration → due to decreased vascularity, reduced water content, decreased collagen cross-linking.                    Extrinsic Causes                  Acromion morphology → when you lift your arm, the rotator cuff rubs against the acromion.                          As we age, the acromion becomes more hooked, and becomes more likely to scrape against the tendon.                                            Findings with Rotator Cuff Disease:          Basically 3 symptoms:                  Restricted motion.          Pain.          Weakness                    On physical exam:                  Active motion &lt;&lt; Passive motion.          In other words, when you ask the patient to move their arm, it moves a lot less than when you move their arm for them.          When the active motion is much smaller than the passive motion, it suggests that the joint itself is fine, but there’s a nerve/muscle/brain/spinal cord problem.          In particular, weakness is seen with movements associated with the cuff muscles.                    Signs of Impinged Nerves                  These signs are based on the idea of taking a damaged tendon and hitting them against a solid structure.            Neer’s Sign → where you take the arm and lift it up. As you lift it up, the damaged part of the supraspinatus will abut against the acromion, and cause pain.                          Here, the damaged tendon hits the coracoacromial arch.                                  Hawkins Sign → same idea to Neer’s sign; take the damaged tendon across the chest, and bang it into the coracoid.                          Here, the damaged tendon hits the coracoid process.                                  Painful Arc → when you try to make a ‘snow-angel’, it hurts, since the tendon abuts against the lateral acromion.                          Here, the damaged tendon hits the lateral acromion.                                            Signs of Impinged Nerves                    Test        Approach        Mechanism                            Neer’s Sign        Passively raise the arm anteriorly        Brings damaged tendon against the coracoacromial arch                    Hawkins Sign        Passively raise the elbow anteriorly        Brings damaged tendon against the coracoid process                    Painful Arc        Abduct the arms        Brings damaged tendon against the lateral acromion              Classification of Rotator Cuff Disease          Stage I → the tendon is painful, but it’s grossly intact.                  There’s inflammation, but structurally it’s intact.                    Stage II → partial thickness defect.      Stage III → full thickness defect.                  This is known as a rotator cuff tear.                    Rotator Cuff Arthropathy (Stage IV) → massive defect in the cuff.                  It’s called rotator cuff arthropathy when the cuff can no longer function in maintaining the stability of the glenohumeral joint.          The head fails to remain centred in the glenoid fossa, and begins to migrate superiorly, and rub against the acromion. This results in arthritis.                      Classification of Rotator Cuff Disease      Stage I → the tendon is painful, but structurally intact.    Stage II → partial thickness defect.    Stage III → full thickness defect (rotator cuff tear).    Rotator Cuff Arthropathy (Stage IV) → when cuff damage results in the head of the humerus displacing and rubbing against the acromion, leading to arthritis (hence ‘arthropathy’).    Treatment of Rotator Cuff Disease          Activity Modification → stop doing the things that make the shoulder sore.      Pain Management → NSAIDs.      Physiotherapy → this is the mainstay of treatment for patients with rotator cuff disease. 75% of patients will get better with physiotherapy.      Injections      Surgery        Surgical Treatment of Rotator Cuff Disease          Generally, surgical treatment is very rare, because PT is tremendously effective.      Surgery is only indicated if:                  Pain persists after an appropriate course of physiotherapy (12 weeks).          Weakness          Following an acute injury (eg. a young patient where the rotator cuff is torn due to sudden trauma, and not long-term degradation).                    Approaches for surgical repair are:                  Stage I → subacromial decompression.          Stage II → subacromial decompression +/- RC repair.                          In this group, it’s controversial whether adding the rotator cuff repair is superior over subacromial decompression only.                                Stage III → subacromial decompression + RC repair.          Stage IV (RC Arthropathy) → shoulder repair.                          Since there’s arthritis and muscle damage, more than just the rotator cuff has to be repaired.                                          Subacromial decompression → this aims to increase the size of the subacromial region to decrease rotator cuff pressure.      Rotator Cuff Repair → surgical repair of rotator cuff defects.      Arthritis  Shoulder Arthritis → typically due to osteoarthritis of the shoulder.          Osteoarthritis is characterized by joint space narrowing, due to wearing down of the cartilage.      Along the margins of the bones, osteophytes are often seen.      As this worsens, subchondral cysts (geodes) form near the articular surface.        Features of Shoulder Arthritis:          Shoulder arthritis is a disorder of progressive pain and stiffness, as a result of (1) cartilage loss and (2) osteophyte formation.      Arthritis can be classified as either noninflammatory or inflammatory.      Inflammatory vs Noninflammatory Shoulder Arthritis            Inflammatory      Noninflammatory                        	      	  Rheumatoid		  Psoriatic		  Crystalline (gout, CPPD)      	            				  Osteoarthritis		  Post-traumatic		              Clinical Features of Osteoarthritis          Deep aching shoulder discomfort.      Both reduced active motion and passive motion:                  Compare this to rotator cuff disease, where active motion is impaired, but passive motion is normal.          Both active and passive motion are impaired here because there are structural joint abnormalities (eg. osteophytes).                    In these cases, the rotator cuff strength is usually actually intact.        Remember      With rotator cuff disease, active motion deteriorates, but passive motion is largely normal.    With osteoarthritis, both active motion and passive motion deteriorate.    Treatment of Shoulder Arthritis → basically the same treatment modalities as we’ve seen previously:          Activity Modification      Analgesics      PT → exercise program.      Surgery        Surgical Treatment of Shoulder Arthritis:          Debridement → typically reserved for young patients.                  This is not curative, because the structural damage to the joint is still there.          However, it does alleviate the sensation of the joint ‘catching’.          Joint replacements are avoided in younger patients because they wear out over time.                    Joint Replacement → replacement of both the humerus and glenoid.                  All arthritis tissue is removed, and is replaced with a metal surface.          Generally have good outcomes (85% good/excellent), and 90% of replacements last 10 years.          Durability is similar to other prostheses.                    ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/21/approach-shoulder.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Shoulder", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe the shoulder (glenohumeral) joint and identify key features of this joint.  Describe and identify key elements of the two joints (sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular) associated with the shoulder joint.  Predict how joint stability would be affected with an injury to each joint.  Compare radiographs of shoulder separations and dislocations.Bones &amp; Ligaments of the ShoulderSurface Landmarks of the Glenohumeral Joint  Anterior Surface Landmarks:          Clavicle.      Acromioclavicular Joint → the joint between the acromion and the clavicle.      Coracoid Process → this is a hook-like protrusion on the front of the scapula where a lot of structures attach.      Greater tuberosity → this is the larger, lateral bump at the head of the humerus.        Posterior Surface Landmarks:          Medial border of the scapula.      Spine of the scapula.      Bones of the Shoulder  The glenohumeral joint, aka. the shoulder joint, is formed by the connection between the scapula and the head of the humerus.  The part of the scapula where the humerus inserts is called the glenoid cavity.          In addition to the cavity itself, there’s a fibrocartilaginous ring that surrounds the outside, to give it more depth.      This is known as the glenoid labrum; this is what tears when you have a labrum tear.        For an introduction to the movement of the joint, see Scapulohumeral Rhythm.1. Features of the Scapula  Since the scapula is shaped somewhat like a triangle, it has 3 angles associated with it: the inferior, lateral, and superior angles.  Similarly, it also has 3 borders (edges) associated with it: the medial, lateral, and superior border.  On the front of the scapula is a hook-like projection called the coracoid process, where a lot of structures attach.          One example of an attaching structure is the coracoclavicular ligament, which, as its name implies, connects the coracoid process and the clavicle. This works together with the acromioclavicular joint to connect the clavicle to the scapula.        On the back of the scapula is a bony projection called the spine of the scapula; it terminates at the acromion process, which is the part of the spine that attaches to the clavicle.  Logically, the cavities formed by the space above and below the spine are called the supraspinous fossa and infraspinous fossa respectively.  The space on the anterior side of the scapula is the subscapular fossa.  Immediately above and below the glenoid cavity are two tubercles where muscles can attach:          Supraglenoid Tubercle, where the long head of the biceps attaches.      Infraglenoid Tubercle, where the triceps attaches.        Finally, immediately medial to the coracoid process is the suprascapular notch, which is effectively a ‘foramen’ because the top part is covered by a ligament called the superior transverse scapular ligament:          This notch is important because the suprascapular nerve runs through it.      Interestingly, the suprascapular artery generally follows the path of the nerve, but when it reaches the suprascapular notch, it actually goes above the ligament, and not through the notch.      2. Features of the Humerus  The head of the humerus has 2 important tubercles on which muscles attach, the greater tubercle, and the lesser tubercle.          The lesser tubercle is more medial and anterior.      The greater tubercle is more lateral and posterior.        The groove between the greater and lesser tubercle is known as the bicipital groove, or the intertubular sulcus.  The top of the bicipital groove is covered by a ligament called the transverse humeral ligament.          This prevents the biceps tendon (which sits inside the groove) from falling out.      Recall that the long head of the biceps attaches to the supraglenoid tubercle, and travels down the bicipital groove.        Importantly, the head of the humerus is way larger than the size of the glenoid cavity, where it inserts.          This improves joint mobility, but it also sacrifices joint stability.      In other words, the joint has a wider range of motion, but it’s more susceptible to dislocation.        The humerus has 2 ‘necks’:          Anatomical Neck → the neck around the rounded part of the humerus which inserts into the joint.      Surgical Neck → the line around the thicker part of the humerus itself.        This is important because the synovial fibrous capsule covers the region past the anatomic neck, but the structures that attach to the humerus itself attach to the area between the anatomic and surgical neck.3. Features of the Clavicle  The clavicle is an s-shaped bone that goes from the sternum to the scapula.          Medially, it articulates with the sternum.      Laterally, it articulates with the acromion of the scapula.        On the lateral end of the clavicle, there are projections of bone, where ligaments attach:          Conoid Tubercle → where the conoid ligament attaches.      Trapezoid Line → where the trapezoid ligament attaches.        Importantly, the conoid ligament and the trapezoid ligament are collectively referred to as the coracoclavicular ligament, which we saw previously.          As mentioned before, this goes between the clavicle and the coracoid process of the scapula, and functions to further attach the two.        In addition to the coracoclavicular ligament, the clavicle is also attached to the scapula via the acromioclavicular joint.  Review on a Radiograph        Scapula    Clavicle    Coracoid process    Glenoid cavity    Acromion    Head of humerus    Greater tubercle    Anatomical neck of humerus    Surgical neck of humerus  Ligaments of the Shoulder  The pectoral girdle (aka. shoulder girdle) is the set of bones which connect the upper limb to the axial skeleton on each side. In other words, this is the clavicle and scapula.  When the arm moves, the pectoral girdle actually moves at 3 locations:          Sternoclavicular Joint → between the medial clavicle and the sternum.      Acromioclavicular Joint → between the lateral clavicle and the acromion of the scapula.      Glenohumeral Joint → between the glenoid fossa of the scapula and the humerus.        Each joint is reinforced by ligaments, as follows:          Sternoclavicular Joint:                  The joint itself is very strong; the clavicle will actually fracture before the joint gets dislocated.          In addition, the sternoclavicular joint is reinforced by 3 ligaments that surround it:                          Sternoclavicular ligaments              Interclavicular ligaments              Costoclavicular ligaments                                As their names suggest, these connect the sternal end of the clavicle to the (1) sternum, (2) other clavicle, and (3) ribs respectively.                    Acromioclavicular Joint:                  There are 2 main ligaments that support this joint.                          Acromioclavicular ligament              Coracoclavicular ligament                                The acromioclavicular ligament covers the acromioclavicular joint.          The coracoclavicular ligament was the ligament we mentioned previously, which comprised of the trapezoid ligament and the conoid ligament.                          Recall that the trapezoid ligament originated at the trapezoid line, and the the conoid ligament originated at the conoid tubercle.              Both attach to the coracoid process.                                          Glenohumeral Joint                  As mentioned before, this joint is particularly weak because the glenoid fossa is much smaller than the head of the humerus (in order to maximize mobility).          As a result, there are a number of important ligaments that prevent dislocations.                          Coracoacromial Ligament               3 Glenohumeral Ligaments → superior, middle, and inferior.                                The coracoacromial ligament is particularly important because it’s a strong ligament that prevents the humerus from dislocating superiorly, by blocking its upward motion.          The glenohumeral ligaments reinforce the humerus from its sides.          Near the bottom of the joint, the ligaments are looser, and form an outpouching called the axillary recess.                          The reason this exists is because the redundant joint tissue is necessary for when the arm is abducted.                                            What part of the glenohumeral joint is weakest?          In other words, if there was a dislocation, where would it be?      This would be the anterior aspect of the joint, since you only have weaker ligamentous support, no strong coracoacromial ligament, and no bony support (ie. scapular support).        Summary of Shoulder Ligaments      Each of the 3 joints of the pectoral girdle are strengthened by ligaments, as follows:    Sternoclavicular Joint              Sternoclavicular ligament.        Interclavicular ligament.        Costoclavicular ligament.              Acromioclavicular Joint              Acromioclavicular ligament.        Coracoclavicular ligament (trapezoid + conoid ligaments).              Glenohumeral Joint              Glenohumeral ligaments.        Coracoacromial ligament              With respect to shoulder stability, the coracoacromial ligament is most important, because it helps prevent superior dislocations of the shoulder.    Clinical Application  A separated shoulder, aka. a sprung shoulder, is when there’s a dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint.          Often seen with injuries where the patient falls on an outstretched arm.        This may include disruption of the surrounding ligaments as well (ie. the acromioclavicular ligament and coracoclavicular ligament).  With more severe injury, the clavicle or acromion can be fractured as well.AP radiograph of normal shoulder on left. The right image shows a patient with a separated (sprung) shoulder. Note that the acromioclavicular joint is separated.Muscles of the Shoulder  The muscles that move the shoulder can be classified as anterior/posterior, superficial/deep, or intrinsic/extrinsic.          Extrinsic muscles refer to muscles that originate outside the shoulder, and attach to it.      Intrinsic muscles refer to muscles that both originate and attach to the shoulder.        Generally, the function of the muscles can be intuited from their origin and attachment.Posterior Extrinsic Muscles1. Superficial Muscles  Trapezius Muscle          Superior fibres elevate and laterally rotate the scapula.      Middle fibres retract the scapula.      Inferior fibres depress and medially rotate the scapula.      Innervated by the Spinal Accessory Nerve (CNXI).        Latissimus Dorsi          Originates at the thoracolumbar fascia, and attaches to the floor of the bicipital groove (between the teres major and pec major → ie. the ‘lady between the two majors’).      This helps medially rotate (internally rotate), adduct, and extend the arm; hence, it’s useful in swimming, rowing, and climbing.      Innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve.        2. Deep Muscles  Levator Scapulae → raises the scapula.          Innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve.        Rhomboids → both the rhomboid major and rhomboid minor retract the scapulae medially.          These are used when you’re ‘bracing’ or squaring your shoulders.      Another example is when you’re scratching your shoulder, as that also involves moving the scapula towards the midline.      Both are innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve.        Anterior Extrinsic Muscles1. Superficial Muscles  Pectoralis Major          This has 2 heads:                  Clavicular Head → arises from the medial 1/3 to 1/2 of the clavicle.          Sternal Head → arises along the lateral border of the sternum.                    As we saw before, this attaches to the lip of the bicipital groove, to one side of the latissiumus dorsi (recall, the ‘lady between the two majors’).      The pec major is the ‘bench press’ muscle; it flexes, medially rotates and adducts the arm.      The same nerves that innervate the pectoralis major innervate the pectoralis minor.        2. Deep Muscles  Serratus Anterior          This functions as the ‘boxer’s muscle’ → since it goes from the medial scapula to the ribs, it functions to bring the scapula forward on the chest wall.                  This is useful in reaching/pushing movements of the arm (eg. in boxing).                      Pectoralis Minor          Deep to the pec major.      Pectoralis minor assists the serratus anterior in protracting the scapula; ie. it also helps with the pushing and reaching motions of the arm.      Pectoralis minor originates at the 3,4,5 ribs, and attach to the coracoid process.

Recall that the serratus anterior and pectoralis minor normally work together to protract the scapula.      When the long thoracic nerve is paralyzed, the coracoid process gets pulled forward by the pectoralis minor, but the serratus anterior is no longer holding the scapula firmly.        This results in winging of the scapula  Remember      Paralysis of the long thoracic nerve that innervates the serratus anterior results in winging of the scapula.  Intrinsic Muscles  As mentioned before, the intrinsic muscles of the shoulder are the ones that are fully contained within the shoulder.  These include the following:          Supraspinatus      Infraspinatus      Teres Minor      Subscapularis      Deltoid Muscle      Teres Major        The Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Minor and Subscapularis collectively form what’s known as the rotator cuff.          You can remember this as SITS → Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres Minor, Subscapularis.        Supraspinatus           This is the muscle covering the scapula, above the spine of the scapula.      The supraspinatus tendon of the muscle is the most commonly torn out of all of the rotator cuff muscles (see right).                  This is usually as a result of sporting injuries.                    Along with the deltoid, this initiates the first 15° of arm abduction.                  To remember this, note that the supraspinatus attaches to the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus; hence when it’s pulled, the arm moves away from the body.                      Infraspinatus           This is the muscle covering the scapula, below the spine of the scapula.      This attaches to the middle facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus; hence, when it’s pulled, it rotates the arm laterally.      Hence this functions as a lateral rotator of the humerus.      Note that both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus are innervated by the same nerve: the suprascapular nerve (C5, C6).                   Recall that this nerve was the one that went through the suprascapular notch, right beside the coracoid process.                      Teres Minor          This attaches to the inferior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus.                  Note that the supraspinatus attaches to the superior facet, the infraspinatus attaches to the middle facet, and the teres minor attaches to the inferior facet.          This can be remembered as SIT, which corresponds to superior, middle, and inferior attachments respectively.                    Hence, when it’s pulled, it also laterally rotates the humerus, but it also functions as a weak adductor.      Unlike the suprascapularis and infrascapularis, the teres minor is innervated by the axillary nerve (C5, C6).        Subscapularis           Recall that the subscapular fossa was the fossa on the other side of the scapula.      The muscle that originates there is the subscapularis.      Unlike the previous 3 ‘SIT’ muscles, which attach to different parts of the greater tubercle, the subscapularis goes over the anterior side of the humerus, and then attaches to the lesser tubercle.                  As a result, when the subscapularis is pulled, it actually medially rotates the arm.                    It’s innervated by the upper and lower subscapular nerves.        Deltoid           The deltoid is comprised of 3 sets of fibres that can act both independently or together.                  Anterior Fibres → attach to the lateral clavicle.          Middle Fibres → attach to the acromion.          Posterior Fibres → attach to the lower edge of the scapular spine.                    In other words, the anterior fibres attach to the front of the shoulder, the middle fibres attach to the side, and the posterior fibres attach to the back.                  All 3 of them attach to the deltoid tuberosity on the humerus.                    This makes it easy to determine their action:                  Anterior Fibres → flex, adduct, and weakly medially rotate the arm (assisting the pectoralis major).          Middle Fibres → abduct the arm.          Posterior Fibres → extend, adduct, weakly and laterally rotate the arm (assisting the latissimus dorsi).                    The middle fibres are the strongest, as they’re in a multipennate arrangement:                  Multipennate → where the central tendon of the muscle branches within a pennate muscle.          Pennate Muscle → where the fibres of the muscle attach obliquely to the tendon. This increases force production at the expense of ROM.                    All 3 groups of fibres are innervated by the axillary nerve.        Teres Major           The teres major is often referred to as the ‘baby lats’, because they perform the same function as the latissimus dorsi, just more weakly.                  These were medial rotation, adduction, and extension of the arm.                    As we mentioned before, this attaches to the medial edge of the bicipital groove (it’s the second major in the ‘lady between two majors’).      It’s innervated by the lower subscapular nerve, which is similar to the subscapularis.

There are 3 spaces that you should be aware of:          Quadrangular Space (QS)      Triangular Space (TS) → aka. Upper Triangular Space.      Triangular Interval (TI) → aka. Lower Triangular Space.        All 3 are bordered by the long head of the triceps.  For a description of the 3, see the following:                   Borders      Key Contents                  Quadrangular Space      	    	      Teres minor superiorly.

Bursae of the Shoulder Joint  Bursa → a bag of synovial fluid outside the joint itself.          Bursae function to prevent the rubbing of bone on muscle, or ligament on bone, etc.      Some are continuous with one another; others are discrete.      When the bursa are inflammed (bursitis), drugs can be injected directly into them.        If the subacromial or subdeltoid bursa are inflammed (see right), then then it’ll make abduction of the arm painful.          Since the supraspinatus helps with the first 15° of rotation, this pain is most pronounced at around the 40°-120° point.      This is referred to as painful arc syndrome.

	{"title": "Injections in the Treatment of Low Back Pain", "text": "Epidemiology of Chronic Back Pain  Prevalence: 28% in Canada  5-10% of patients with low back pain (LBP) develop chronic pain  Low back pain is the most common chronic pain syndrome seen in pain clinics.  However, much like the common cold, we have no cure for chronic back pain; treatment is based on management of the symptoms.Management Principles with Low Back Pain  Probably the most important part of the lecture:          Injections play a role, but they are limited.      Physical therapy, and cognitive therapy, can play a significant role in managing pain (they’re not just adjunctive treatments!)      In particular, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has a great deal of evidence supporting its use.      It’s often important to tell patients to practice pacing.                   Rather than going bonkers in moments when the pain is gone, it’s better not to push yourself.          In fact, often the worst pain seen with LBP are on the days following the ‘good days’, when the patients push themselves too far.                      Treatment outcomes should by assessed by changes in both function and pain.The Role of Injections in Chronic Pain  Injections aren’t always done solely to relieve pain; they can be used for any of the following purposes:          Diagnostic → help determine the site of pain origin.                  If a local injection relieves pain significantly, then there may be an anatomic cause that can be remedied.                    Prognostic → predict the efficacy of future therapies.                  It’s better to pursue interventions after knowing if they’ll be efficacious or not.          If a local injection improves pain, then it’s more likely than an intervention will be effective.                    Therapeutic → reduce pain and enable rehabilitation.      Contraindications to Injection Therapies  Coagulopathy → bleeding disorders or anticoagulation could result in compressive hematomas of the spine.  Pregnancy → relative contraindication; a lot of these injections use fluoroscopy, so there’s a risk of radiation exposure to the baby.  Infection → current infection + exposure to spinal structures = bad idea.  Lack of patient consent/cooperation.  Unknown neurologic deficit.  Inadequate equipment/inability to manage emergency situtations.  Inadequate assistance or monitoring.  Inability to properly position patient.Complications of Injection Therapies  Failure to produce desired results.  Local Complications: pain, bruising, infection, muscle spasm, needle trauma. Pain and bruising are fairly common, but minor.  Systemic Toxicity: local anesthetic, epinephrine (eg. ↑HR with excess), allergic reactions.  Neurologic Complications: nerve damage (very rare), unwanted spread of local anesthetic to adjacent neural structures.  Vascular Injury: Artery of Adamkiewicz, segmental arteries, epidural veins.          Artery of Adamkiewicz: an important segmental feeder of the spinal cord, generally located in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar region. Damage to it will impair spinal blood flow.      Approach to Low Back Pain Intervention  Generally, your approach focuses on differentiating between radicular pain (due to nerve root irritation), or axial pain (which causes local irritation).          As seen in previous lectures, radicular pain will radiate, while axial pain will cause local symptoms.      Knowing the localization helps guide your injection locale.        Does imaging help with our treatment approach?          To a certain extent, but unfortunately, imaging usually isn’t particularly useful.      Although patients with chronic back pain do have an increase in anatomic abnormalities on imaging (eg. disc herniation), many asymptomatic patients have these findings as well!      As such, it’s impossible to determine whether a patient has back pain or not from their imaging findings, and it’s difficult to say whether one particular anatomic abnormality is the cause of the pain.      Common Causes of Chronic Low Back Pain1. Facet Joint Mediated Pain  Recall that the facet joint was formed between the superior and inferior articular facets of adjacent vertebrae.  These are true joints: they’re lined with synovium and have a true joint capsule.  The medial branches of the dorsal rami innervate the facet joints; so pain can be felt here.  Each facet joint receives innervation from two spinal levels.          That is, the medial branches of the dorsal rami coming from the spinal level above and below the facet joint.        Treatment options for Facet Joint Mediated Pain:          Intra-articular Injections → steroids are injected into the facet joint, via X-ray/US guidance.                  Provides pain relief that lasts a few months.                    Medial Branch Rhizotomy → burning of the medial branches of the dorsal rami that innervate the facet joint in question.                  Gives longer-lasting pain relief to patients (8-12 months).          However, before actually burning the nerve, a ‘simulated rhizotomy’ must be done first, where a local anesthetic nerve block is tried on the joint.          If that reduces pain, then we know that the facet joint is the pain source, and that rhizotomy will be effective.                      Is there good evidence for the use of these treatments?          Intra-articular Injections → poor evidence; seems to be limited to clinical experience and observational studies.                  Moderate evidence actually suggests that facet injections are not much different from placebo for short term pain relief and improvement from disability.                    Medial Branch Rhizotomies → more robust evidence.                  One randomized trial does see significant improvement at 6 months (although only with a sample size of 40).          Other observational studies agree with this.

Intervertebral Disc Mediated Pain  Recall that the interverebral disc is comprised of an inner nucleus pulosus and an outer annulus fibrosus.          The annular layer receives sensory innervation from a variety of sources.      In particular, on the posterior side (where most disc herniations occur), the annulus receives innervation from the sinuvertebral nerves.                  The sinuvertebral nerves are also known as the recurrent meningeal nerves, or the recurrent nerves of Luschka.                    The nucleus pulposus has no sensory innervation; hence, when the disc herniates, it’s the sensory fibres in the annulus or the surrounding tissue that trigger pain.        Treatment options for Intervertebral Disc Mediated Pain:            Interdiscal Electrothermal Therapy → uses heat to modify the collagen fibres of the disc and destroy local pain receptors.                  Heating of the disc is done with a special wire, called an electrothermal catheter.          Long-term effects of this procedure are not known.                      Disc Biacuplasty → two probes are inserted obliquely into the disc from either side, and then a current running from one probe to the other ‘deactivates’ the sensory nerve fibres in the disc.                  Requires sufficient disc height in order to insert the probes.                      Is there good evidence for the use of these treatments?          Interdiscal Electrothermal Therapy → moderate for short term discogenic pain, but we have no idea what long term consequences are.      Disc Biacuplasty → limited for short term improvement, but intermediate for long term improvement (6 months).

Sacroiliac Joint Mediated Pain  The sacroiliac joints are formed by the articular surfaces of the sacrum and the iliac bones.   They bear the weight of the trunk, and hence are subject to the development of strain and arthritis.  Studies have attempted to identify referral patterns for SI joint mediated pain, and have suggested the following:          Buttock, lower lumbar region, lower extremity, groin, upper lumbar region, and abdomen.      This can often mimic sciatica, except it won’t go past the knee, will be more deep seated, and will be described more as joint pain (aching) vs nerve pain (burning).        Although dozens of physical exam tests have been proposed for identifying SI joint problems, evidence suggests that no Hx or P/E findings are consistently capable of differentiating them.  Treatment options for Sacroiliac Joint Mediated Pain:          SI Joint Injections → local anesthetic and steroid are injected into the SI joint.                  Analogous to an intra-articular injection to the facet joint.                    SI Joint Radiofrequency Neurotomy → radiofrequency ablation of nerves to the SI joint.                    Analogous to medial branch rhizotomy with the facet joint.          The nerves that are targeted are mainly lateral branches from S1/S2 that come out of the dorsal foramen of the sacrum and feed the SI joint.          Hence, we basically go down in a line, and burn all the nerves lateral to the dorsal foramina.                      Is there good evidence for the use of these treatments?          SI Joint Injections → limited for both short and long-term relief (just like injections to the facet joint).      SI Joint Radiofrequency Ablation → limited as well.

Advanced Pain Therapies  Some advanced pain therapies include:          Spinal Cord Stimulation                   This is where a simulator is inserted into the spinal canal.          This is similar to a pacemaker (with a battery and a computer), with an electrical wire that zaps the region where the patient complains of pain.          The idea here is that the electrical stimulation overloads the nervous system so that the pain signals don’t reach the brain.                    Intrathecal Pump                   Another medical device, which is used to deliver medications directly into the space between the spinal cord and its protective sheath (theca = sheath).          Usually used to deliver high doses of analgesics than would be tolerated normally when injected systemically.                      What are the indications for these therapies?          Spinal Cord Stimulation:                  Failed Back Surgery Syndrome          Arachnoiditis with Radiculopathy          Complex Regional Pain Syndome          Peripheral Ischemic Neuropathy          Intractable Angina                    Intrathecal Pump:                  Outside of the context of low back pain, these are often used for patients with spasticity.          In the context of LBP, this is used for:                          Severe Osteoporosis              Somatic Back Pain without a neuropathic element              Lower extremity cancer pain                                            What is the evidence for these therapies?          Spinal Cord Stimulation:                  The evidence for failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome is strong for short term relief and moderate for long term relief.                    Intrathecal Pump:                  The evidence for implantable intrathecal infusion systems is strong for short term improvement in pain of malignancy or neuropathic pain.          The evidence is moderate for long term management of chronic pain.

Effectiveness of a large variety of therapeutic interventions used to manage chronic back pain has not been demonstrated conclusively.  There is increasing evidence supporting the use of interventional techniques in managing spinal pain.  Interventional techniques should be provided in the context of comprehensive chronic pain management.          In other words, don’t forget your physical and cognitive therapy!

	{"title": "Imaging with Low Back Pain &amp; Radiculopathy", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Learn about common causes of low back pain and radiculopathy.          Radiculopathy → nerve root damage (due to any cause).        Identify red flags for less common causes of LBP requiring urgent care.  Discuss rational management strategies.  Objective      Learn about common causes of low back pain and radiculopathy.    Causes of low back pain can be classified by their anatomic location, or by their etiology:          Anatomic Location → cord, nerves, meninges, spinal arteries/veins, bony spine, discs, retroperitoneum, paravertebral soft tissues.      Etiology → (VITAMIN-C); Vascular, Infectious, Trauma, Autoimmune, Metabolic, Iatrogenic, Neoplastic, Congenital, etc.        Objective      Identify red flags for less common causes of LBP requiring urgent care.    As mentioned in the previous lecture, these are signs of:          Cancer or Infection.      Spinal Fracture.      Cauda Equina or Progressive Neurologic Deficits.        Cancer or Infection:          Age &gt;50 or &lt;20 y/o.                  Recall that &gt;50 increases likelihood of cancer; &lt;20 increases likelihood of infection.                    Past history of Cancer.      Unexplained weightloss, fever, chills.      Immunosuppression.      UTIs, IVDU.      Back pain not improved with rest, or night pain.        Spinal Fracture:          Previous trauma.      Steroid use (weakens bones).      Age &gt;70 years.        Cauda Equina Syndrome (or severe neurologic compromise):          Bowel dysfunction.      Bladder dysfunction.      Saddle anesthesia.      Erectile dysfunction.        Objective      Discuss rational management strategies.    MRI is the best diagnostic test for low back pain ($$$):          CTs ($$) are sometimes used as a complement to an MRI because they can show the bones better.      X-Rays ($) are used more as a screening tool, since they’re only really effective at showing the bones.        However, routine imaging does not improve patient outcomes.          In other words, not every patient who reports back pain needs to have imaging done!                  This is especially true since in 85% of cases, no specific diagnosis is made, and 90% of patients will improve without treatment.                    Routine imaging has some negative consequences as well:                  Accuracy:                          Imaging will often result in false positives; it cannot distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic findings.              Imaging will also often have false negatives; the spine is a dynamic structure, so the cause may not be present at the time of imaging.                                Cost → imaging is expensive, has psychological consequences, and exposes patients to radiation and other risks.          Utility                           Oftentimes, the medical management remains the same, regardless of the cause.              Why image all patients when the end treatment is the same?                                            When should imaging (MRI) be done then?          Generally, when red flags are present, as listed above.                  For more specific referral guidelines, see the Canadian Association of Radiologists Guidelines for the Spine.                    Management should be geared towards ruling out red flag causes (tumour, infection, fracture, cauda equina, progressive neurologic compromise), and aiming for conservative management otherwise.      Low Back Pain CasesCase #1  Case Summary      45 yo M    Low Back Pain x years    3 weeks pain radiating down right leg    Would you image this patient?          Yes → although this isn’t a red flag per se, the fact that his back pain has suddenly changed suggests that imaging would be helpful.      From the history, it suggests that this is a radiculopathy.      Since he doesn’t direclty meet the red flag criteria, an MRI does not need to be done urgently.        Imaging revealed a disc herniation, as seen below:          Note that T1 shows CSF as dark, and T2 shows CSF as bright.      This was a herniation of a lumbar disc.        What is the natural history of a lumbar disc herniation?          90% of patients with a lumbar disc herniation (even with radiculopathy) resolve in 6 weeks; however 5% will have recurrent disc herniation.      Conservative treatment is preferred (NSAIDs, PT, bed rest, epidural steroid injections may help).      Surgery can be done in some causes, but although it has a &gt;90% success rate, there’s a 5% risk of ‘failed back’ syndrome.      Failed Back Syndrome → where back pain persists after surgery.                    Causes are manifold, including recurrent disc herniation, arachnoiditis, infection, and an incorrect initial diagnosis.          One important cause is an epidural scar due to surgery, because it can easily be picked up on imaging (seen on the right).                    Case #2  Case Summary      79 yo M.    Back and leg pain with walking, relieved with sitting.    Imaging revealed lumbar spinal stenosis, as seen below:          Recall that this was a narrowing of the vertebral canal.      This results in neurogenic claudication when the spine is extended, which narrows the vertebral canal.      Hence, the patient has pain with walking (extending the spine), and it’s relieved with flexion.      As mentioned before, neurogenic claudication (caused by spinal stenosis) is different from vascular claudication: in one, the pain with walking is due to nerve compression; in the other, it’s due to vascular insufficiency.      Surgery can be done to decompress the canal.      Here, note that the thickening of the ligamentum flavum, posterior bulging of the disc, and inflammation of the facet joints results in narrowing of the vertebral canal.Case #3  Case Summary      21 yo M, varsity athlete    2 years of LBP    Would you image this patient?          Yes; the patient was &lt;20 when the back pain started.      Since he’s an athlete, he also undoubtedly has a past Hx of trauma.        Imaging revealed Spondylolysis, as seen below:          Recall that spondylolysis = fracture of the pars interarticularis.                  Fairly common: seen in 5-7% of the general population, and 22-44% of competitive athletes (!).                    Since the vertebrae is now no longer connected via the facet joint, it can easily slip out → spondylolisthesis.        How is Spondylolysis treated?          Conservative treatment, especially if the fracture only occurs in one site.      If spondylolysis proceeds to progressive spondylolisthesis (ie. the disc starts to slip), then surgical stabilization needs to be done.      Note the obvious fracture of the pars interarticularis. However, no slippage of the vertebrae has occured yet, ie. there's no spondylolisthesis.  When imaging the lumbar spine obliquely, the posterior elements of the vertebrae form a Scottie Dog (see below)          Scottie dog → ie, a Scottish Terrier.      The transverse process is the nose.      The pedicle forms the eye.      The inferior articular facet is the front leg.      The superior articular facet is the ear.      The pars interarticularis (the part of the lamina between the two facets) is the neck.        Hence, when there’s spondylolysis, it looks like there’s a collar around the scottie dog’s neck          This could also be a decapitated scottie dog, if you’re of the macabre persuasion.        Remember      Spondylolysis (fracture of the pars interarticularis) results in a collared ‘Scottie Dog Sign’  Case #4  Case Summary      79 yo F.    Fell off chair 2 weeks ago.    Low Back Pain.    Would you image this patient?          Yes; she’s &gt;50, so you worry about a tumour or a fracture.        Imaging revealed the following:          Here, the T2 image was ‘fat suppressed’, where the fat brightness is suppressed.      Where is the abnormality here?                  Definitely L2, which has lost height and is pushing into the vertebral canal.          Also T12, where there’s some signal change at the top of the vertebral body (hyperintense on T2; hypointense on T1).                    Here, the compression of the vertebral canal at L2 is less significant than the signal change at T12 (which is much more suggestive of something insidious).        You have to differentiate this signal change as either osteoporotic changes or metastases:          Methods to differentiate the two won’t be tested.      However, it’s important to note that you have to rule out cancer when you see a signal change.        In this case, this was an Osteoporotic Compression Fracture:          These heal well in young patients, although there’s an increased incidence of future disc degeneration      In osteoporotic patients, this may progress.      Management is usually conservative.      Vertebroplasty can be done for severe persistent pain:                  Vertebroplasty → injection of bone cement into the collapsed vertebral body.          Thought to be a great, non-invasive approach to improve symptoms in these patients (no need to open up the back).          However, studies have shown that the effect of this procedure is largely due to a placebo effect.                          In a sham-controlled study, where control patients just received an injection of local anesthesia, there was a comparable improvement in symptoms!                                More recent observational studies suggest that there may still be a benefit in some cases, but vertebroplasty remains very controversial.                    Case #5  Case Summary      89 yo F.    fall on ice.    severe LBP, bedridden.    Imaging revealed a sacral insufficiency fracture, as shown below:          Insufficiency fractures are a type of stress fracture, which are the result of normal stresses on abnormal bone.      Hence, these are often seen with osteoporotic patients, with weakened bones.        A Nuclear Medicine Bone Scan can reveal a Honda Sign when there’s a sacral insufficiency fracture:          These bone scans (Bone Scintigraphy) involves using a radioisotope that localizes to regions of bone turnover.      The more active the bone turnover (eg, at a fracture), the more radioactive material will be seen.      With a sacral insufficiency fracture, the break will form an ‘H’, resulting in a Honda Sign (since it looks like the Honda logo), also known as an H-Sign.         Similar to vertebroplasty with an osteoporotic compression fracture, sacroplasty can be done with a sacral fracture:          Sacroplasty involves inserting two needles at an angle into the sacrum (sort of like two crossed lightsabers), to inject bone cement.      This helps stabilize the sacrum in a similar fashion to vertebroplasty.      Case #6  Case Summary      47 y/o F.    Low back pain x 12 months.    Occasional pain down both legs.    Should this person be imaged?          Probably not; no red flag features.      This would change if she had been treated conservatively, and hadn’t been responding to it.      In this case, an X-ray was done as a cheap and quick screening test, since it had been going on for a while.        A spine X-ray was done, revealing the following:            Is there anything peculiar here?      Note that the posterior part of the L2 vertebral body is caved in! (look at the margins of each vertebral body)      This suggests that there’s something pushing on the body from within the vertebral canal.      Since something was found on X-ray, an MRI was then ordered on the patient.        Imaging revealed a mass in the vertebral cord, as shown below          Note that it’s pressing on the L2 vertebrae, and it’s well circumscribed.      Imaging characteristics and the patient history (slow growing, well circumscribed, etc) suggested that this was a meningioma.        What are features of a Meningioma?          Meningioma → slow growing, benign tumour. It compresses, but does not invade.      Arises from the arachnoid.      Excellent prognosis with a complete excision (which is possible in &gt;95% of cases).      Adjunctive radiation is done if the tumour cannot completely be excised, or the tumour is aggressive.      Case #7  Case Summary      67 yo F.    Low Back Pain x 6 weeks.    Patient had constitutional symptoms.    Would you image this patient?          Yes; the patient is &gt;50, and had constitutional symptoms.      A screening X-ray revealed an abnormality at the level of L2/L3 (seen to the right).      Since there was an abnormal finding, the patient then proceeded to have an MRI.        An MRI revealed the following          Abnormal tissue, damage to the vertebral endplates, compression of the vertebral canal, and involvement of the intervertebral discs.      This is classic for osteomyelitis-discitis.        What are features of Osteomyelitis-Discitis?          Osteomyelitis → infection/inflammation of the bone or bone marrow.      Discitis → infection/inflammation in the intervertebral disc space.      Most commonly caused by Staph. aureus.                  E.coli is the most common Gram Negative cause.          Additionally, Salmonella is possible in patients with sickle cell, and TB is possible in patients with foreign travel.

	{"title": "Approach to Low Back Pain", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Recognize and identify common low back problems.  Develop an approach to treatment for low back pain.  Understand when to order tests and which ones.  Understand prognosis for different low back problems.  Know red flags and their signficance.Review of Spinal Anatomy  The spine is comprised of vertebral bodies, separated by intervertebral discs.  Adjacent vertebrae are attached to one another by facet joints.  The intervertebral discs are composed of an outer annulus and an inner nucleus.          The outer annulus is more fibrous; the inner nucleus is gel like.      Recall that the inner nucleus was a remnant of the notochord.        With a disc herniation, the outside annulus tears, leading to extravasation of the inner nuclear ‘gel’  Objective      Develop an approach to treatment for low back pain.  The Lower Back Pain History  85% will have no specific diagnosis; however most will get better within 1 month.  In general, the history is the most important part in determining a diagnosis with lower back pain.  Some things that you should assess on history include:          Pain → OPQRST      Weakness      Numbness/Tingling      Incoordination        Pain:          Pain that is dull/aching is more suggestive of muscle causes.      Pain that is throbbing can suggest nerve/muscle causes.      Sharp pain might suggest a fracture.      Burning/numbing/tingling pain suggests a nerve-related cause.        Weakness:          Suggests a nerve/muscle/tendon problem.      Determine what is week, and what structures are around the weak area.        Numbness/Tingling:          Numbness (ie. a loss of sensation) is always nerve related.      Tingling (ie. a ‘stinging sensation’) can be muscle related, or nerve related.        Incoordination:          Suggestive of a nerve/muscle problem.      Look at structures in the surrounding area.      The Physical Exam  The physical exam should be used to corroborate the story heard on history, and to rule out red flags.  Should only contribute 5% to the diagnosis; the history is by far the most important.  Tests are for motor, sensory, reflexes, gait, etc.  Objective      Know red flags and their signficance.    Red flags correspond to a few serious issues we worry about:          Infection      Tumours      Cauda Equina      Progressive Neurologic Deficits.        Red flags on history:          Age of the patient:                  &lt;20 or &gt;50.          Tumours are more likely in older patients; infections are more likely in younger patients.          When you see a patient in these ranges, suspect non-muscle/ligament pain.                    History of cancer → increases likelihood that pain is related to cancer mets.      Weight loss, night or rest pain                  Increases likelihood that this is cancer/infection related.                    Immunosuppresion, IV drug use, recent infection, fever, chills.                  Increases likelihood that this is infection related.                    Trauma → increases likelihood of fracture.      Bowel, bladder, saddle anesthesia, erectile dysfunction                  Suggestive signs of cauda equina.          Extremely important, because injury to cauda equina generally does not heal well, unlike other causes of back pain.          Patients with cauda equina syndrome will have long-lasting complications unless treated immediately!                      Yellow flags:          Yellow flags will affect complaince or patient response to back pain.      They include psychosocial factors like work status, litigation, depression, narcotic overuse, and the duration of symptoms.        Objective      Recognize and identify common low back problems.    The low back problems that will be discussed are as follows:          Tumour      Disc Herniation      Mechanical Causes (Stenosis, Spondylosis, Spondylolysis, Spondylolisthesis)      Tumour  Here, back pain is often associated with weight loss.  The most common tumour of the spine is metastases.          Spinal mets are actually seen in 10% of cancer patients.      The most common cancers that spread to the spine are prostate, breast, and lung cancers.        Metastases most commonly spread to the vertebral bodies, and generally don’t penetrate the spinal cord (97% are extradural).          Mets are spread to the spine via emboli through the blood stream.        Presentation:          Progressive pain, during rest and/or sleep.      Systemic symptoms (eg. unexplained weight loss).      Neurologic involvement: 76% of patients will be weak at the time of diagnosis.        Diagnosis:          MRI is best for visualization.      X-rays are non-sensitive; they’re usually only effective for fractures, or things specfic to the bone.      Bone scans can be used to look for regions of inflammation.                  Not useful generally, except for blastic types of tumours.                      Treatment:          Supportive → pain relief, preservation of neurologic function, preservation of spinal stability      Disc Herniation  Recall from Anatomy of the Spine that disc herniations most commonly occur in lordotic regions of the spine (ie. cervical/lumbar regions).          Hence, the most common levels for disc herniation are C5-6 and L5-S1.        Typically disc herniation is asymptomatic:          Disk herniation is a normal phenomenon in patients over the age of 45; it’s not worrisome unless it’s causing pain.      In one experiment, the entire US Olympic gymnastics team had their spine imaged. Everyone had disc herniation; none had back pain.        Symptoms will occur due to compression of the surrounding structures by the nucleus pulposus.          Recall that compression of the ligament will present with localized pain, while compression of a spinal nerve will result in radiation and neurologic features.        Diagnosis:          Most commonly from clinical history.                  Since posterior/posterolateral herniations are most common, pain will often be worse with flexion (which stretches the posterior spine), and better with extension (lying down, standing).                    EMG (electromyography), MRI, can also be done.        Treatment          Most disc herniations will resolve with conservative treatment:                  This applies even if the herniation pushes on the nerve!          Conservative treatment would include PT, exercise, avoiding certain postures, NSAIDs.                    The natural history is for improvement over 6 months - 2 years without surgery.                  Surgery is only done if the pain is progressive, neurologic signs are worsening, or if the patient needs to recover quickly for personal/professional reasons.          Another reason is if there Cauda Equina Syndrome, which will not resolve with conservative Tx.          Surgical options include disc replacement (if young, healthy, and one level involvement), or a partial discectomy.                    Surgery doesn’t improve outcomes; it just gets you there faster.        Cauda Equina Syndrome:          Compression of S2,3,4, which, as we recall, includes the pudendal nerve.      Hence, this results in bowel/bladder involvement, numbness around the perinanal region (saddle anesthesia), and erectile dysfunction.                  Recall that these were the red flags we discussed previously.                    Cauda Equina is a medical emergency → as mentioned before, these nerves don’t recover well conservatively, unlike with other herniations.        Classic Features of Cauda Equina      Bowel problems.    Bladder problems.    Saddle Anesthesia.    Erectile Dysfunction.  Lumbar Stenosis  Stenosis = narrowing of an area.  Lumbar stenosis = narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal or intervertebral foramen below a critical level, resulting in nerve compression.          Can be due to disc herniation, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, or osteophyte formation.        Presentation:          Pain, typically in the back and legs.                  Worse with extension, but better with flexion (the ‘shopping cart sign’, because flexing forward to push a shopping cart alleviates pain).          This is because extension narrows the vertebral canal, exacerbating the stenotic area.                    Numbness, tingling, and weakness are also possible signs, which may be present on physical exam.        Remember      Disc Herniation will be worse with flexion, and better with extension.              Since flexion stretches the posterior side of the spine, where most herniations occur.              Lumbar Stenosis will be worse with extension, and better with flexion.              Since extension narrows the vertebral canal, exacerbating the stenosis.              Leg pain with walking may be due to a neurogenic or a vascular cause:          Neurogenic → lumbar spinal stenosis.      Vascular → ie. claudication due to circulatory insufficiency.      Leg pain from either condition will go away with rest, but with spinal stenosis the patient usually has to sit down for a few minutes to ease the leg and often low back pain, whereas leg pain from vascular claudication will go away if the patient simply stops walking.        Cervical vs Lumbar Stenosis          Stenosis of the vertebral canal will present differently depending on whether it’s pinched in the cervical region or in the lumbar region.                  Cervical Stenosis results in an upper motor neuron problem.          Lumbar Stenosis results in a lower motor neuron problem.                    Recall that:                   Upper motor neuron = brain &amp; spinal cord.          Lower motor neuron = nerve roots (ie. once they leave the spinal cord).                    This makes it easy to remember that lumbar stenosis is a lower motor neuron problem; since the spinal cord ends at L1/L2, any narrowing beyond this point will be outside the spinal cord (and hence LMN).      Knowing this is important in making a diagnosis:                  Upper motor neuron problems will result in hyperreflexia and spasms.          Lower motor neuron problems will result in the opposite: atrophy, muscle weakness, etc.                      Remember      Cervical Stenosis results in an upper motor neuron problem.    Lumbar Stenosis results in a lower motor neuron problem.  Spondylosis, Spondylolysis, Spondylolisthesis  These 3 terms sound similar, but mean different things (very confusing):          Spondylosis → degenerative changes of the spine.      Spondylolysis → fracture of the pars interarticularis.                  Pars interarticularis = the connection between the two facets of the facet joint (the superior and inferior articular facets).                    Spondylolisthesis → slippage of vertebrae relative to adjacent one, usually due to a pars interarticularis fracture (spondylolysis).        Spondylosis vs. Spondylolysis vs. Spondylolisthesis      Spondylosis → degenerative changes of the spine.    Spondylolysis → fracture of the pars interarticularis.    Spondylolisthesis → slippage of one vertebrae relative to another, typically due to spondylolysis.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Spine", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe normal curvatures of the spine.  Identify the key features of vertebral column and compare various views of radiographic images.  Identify and describe the joints and ligaments of the vertebral column, including the intervertebral discs, zygopophyseal, sacroiliac joint.  List the muscles that support the back.  Describe the Spinal Cord in Relation to the Vertebral Column and the clinical significance.Spinal Anatomy  The vertebral column is made up of a curved series of bones, called vertebrae.  These vertebrae are classified as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, or coccygeal.  The number of vertebrae in each is as follows:          Cervical → 7 vertebrae.      Thoracic → 12 vertebrae.      Lumbar → 5 vertebrae.      Sacral → 5 vertebrae.      Coccygeal → 3-5 vertebrae (this varies since this is a vestigial structure).        As we saw long ago in ITM, one easy way to remember this is the times at which you’d eat breakfast (7), lunch (12), and dinner (5).  The total number of vertebrae is usually 33.          The sacral vertebrae are fused to form the sacrum.      The coccygeal vertebrae are fused to form the coccyx, aka. the tailbone.        The vertebral canal, which houses and protects the spinal cord, runs through the vertebral foramen of each vertebrae.  Note that as we go cranially to caudally, the intervertebral discs get thicker. This allows the lower spine to support more weight.  In addition, there are some key vertebrae that have some specific names:            C1 → aka. the atlas.                  This is the bone that supports the head, hence it’s known as the ‘atlas’.          Note that C1 does not have a body; it’s shaped like a ring for the head to balance on top of.                    C2 → aka. the axis.                  C2 projects into the atlas, and facilitates its rotation. Hence, it’s referred to as the ‘axis’, since it acts as an axis of rotation.          Its projection (which sticks through into C1 like a finger through a ring), is called the odontoid process, or the dens/peg.                    C7 → aka. the vertebra prominens.                  C7 is known as the ‘vertebra prominens’ because its spinous process is longer and more prominent than with the other spinous processes.          Hence it’s used as a landmark when examining the head and neck (it’s the first ‘big bump’ you feel when you palpate the bones of your spine from behind).          It’s difficult to feel the spinous processes above C7 because they’re smaller, and there’s a ligament in front of them (the ligamentum nuchae).                    Normal Curvatures of the Spine  During development, the entire spine is ‘C’ shaped and kyphotic (see right).  Hence, any curvature of the spine that is kyphotic is referred to as a primary curvature, since it mirrors the embryonic curvature, and was present before birth.  Any lordotic curvature of the spine is dissimilar from the embryologic curvature, and is hence referred to as a secondary curvature.  Hence, we have a:            Secondary cervical curve (ie. cervical lordosis).      Primary thoracic curve (ie. thoracic kyphosis).      Secondary lumbar curve (ie. lumbar lordosis).      Primary sacral curve (ie. sacral kyphosis).        The secondary curvatures arise after birth:          The secondary cervical curve arises when the baby begins to hold up its head.      The secondary lumbar curve arises when the baby begins to walk.        In women, the lordotic lumbar curve is more prominent (hence it seems like women ‘stick out their butt more’).  Clinically, kyphosis, lordosis, and scoliosis also refer to excessive curvatures of the spine:          Kyphosis = excessive thoracic kyphosis (ie. a hunchback).      Lordosis = excessive lumbar lordosis.      Scoliosis = lateral curvature (ie. in the coronal plane).      Features of the Spinal Vertebra  There is a solid body, which is what lies above/below the intervertebral discs.          The shape of the body differs depending on the level of the vertebrae: thoracic vertebrae have a heart shaped body; lumbar vertebrae have a kidney shaped body.      To remember this, just picture the organs in each region (the heart is thoracic, the kidneys are lumbar).        From this body extends two stems called pedicles.  At the end of these pedicles are transverse processes that stick outwards.          These transverse processes are thick in the thoracic region, where the ribs need to attach to them.      They become slender in the lumbar region, where the muscles attach.        From this, two projections then come together medially and connect to form a spinous process. This is what ‘sticks out of your back’.  The bone that comes from the pedicles to the spinous process is flattened; hence it’s called the lamina.  The hole bordered by the pedicles and the lamina is where the spinal cord will run through; this hole is called the vertebral foramen.          Together, all of the vertebral foramen form the vertebral canal.        In addition, there are 2 processes that extend upwards and 2 processes that extend downwards from each vertebrae; these are known as superior articular processes and inferior articular processes respectively.          The inferior articular processes connect with the superior articular processes of the vertebrae immediately below the current one.      Where they join, they form a facet joint (aka. a zygapophysial joint). This is circled in red above.      This is a synovial joint that guides and restricts lateral rotation (from side to side). Note that the facet joints are not built for weight bearing.        Between the body of each vertebrae is an intervertebral disc.  How many processes extend from each vertebrae?          We have 2 transverse processes that project to the side.      We have 1 spinous process that projects posteriorly.      We have 2 superior articular processes that project up.      We have 2 inferior articular processes that project down.      In other words, there are 7 processes that extend from each vertebrae.      Above is a CT scan (left) and an X-ray (right) of the spine. Note that the spinal cord lies between the vertebral bodies and the spinous processes.Ligaments of the Spine  There are 5 major ligaments that you need to know about:          Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL):                  As given by the name, this lies anterior to the vertebral bodies.          This is a tough ligament, because it needs to oppose the anterior push of the vertebrae (there are important structures anteriorly).                    Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL):                  This lies just posterior to the vertebral bodies.          This is a weaker ligament than the ALL, and is actually somewhat fused to the vertebral bodies.          Note that this does not lie posterior to the vertebrae themselves; rather it lies just behind the vertebral bodies, on the anterior side of the vertebral foramen.                    Ligamentum Flavum                  This is particularly important, because it’s the strongest ligament in the spine. It helps protect elements in the canal.          Flavum = yellow, so just like its name implies, this ligament is yellow. The yellow coloration is because this is composed of fibrocartilage.          This lies on the posterior side of the vertebral foramen.          In other words, the vertebral foramen is covered by the PLL in the front, and the ligamentum flavum in the back.                    Interspinous Ligament                  As the name implies, this ligament wraps between the spinous processes of the spinal vertebrae.          This is fairly flexible, in order to allow for the flexion and rotation of the spine.                    Supraspinous Ligament                  Just as the name suggests, this wraps over the spinous processes, and is hence the most posterior ligament of the spine.          Since this wraps outside the spinous processes, it’s less flexible than the interspinous ligament.                      This also corresponds to the position of the ligaments anteriorly to posteriorly, ie:          ALL → PLL → ligamentum flavum → interspinous → supraspinous.      This can be better seen in the figure below.        When would you pierce these ligaments clinically?          You would pierce the posterior ligaments (supraspinous, interspinous, ligamentum flavum) if you were performing a spinal tap or epidural.      Why is this a safe spot to inject anesthetic?       Recall that in the vertebral canal, we also have blood vessels. However, most of these blood vessels are present anteriorly, so a posterior approach reduces the risk of bleeding.      Also, we inject anesthetic at the level of L4 (the PSIS), which is below the conus medullaris. Hence, we avoid the spinal cord and instead inject between fibres of the cauda equina.      The Intervertebral Discs  The intervertebral discs are comprised of an fibrous outer layer and a soft inner layer.          The fibrous outer layer is referred to as the annulus fibrosus.      The soft, gelatinous inner layer is referred to as the nucleus pulposus.        These have different origins embryologically:          Recall that the notochord develops into the neural tube.      The vertebral column develops around the neural tube.      As this happens, the notochord actually gets absorbed into the vertebral column, and becomes the nucleus pulposus.        Remember      The nucleus pulposus (inner layer of the intervertebral discs) is the remnant of the notochord.    There’s no blood supply feeding the intervertebral discs, so how do they get nutrients?          They obtain nutrients from the surrounding vessels, through a neat mechanism.      In a loaded state (seated/standing), the intervertebral discs are compressed, forcing H2O molecules out. This water is absorbed by surrounding capillaries.      In an unloaded state (lying down), this fluid (supplemented with nutrients), gushes back into the discs.      This transmission of fluid in and out of the discs also explains why you’re taller with some rest. 25% of the vertebral length is accounted for by the discs, so any change in this thickness can have a noticeable impact on height.        A herniated disc occurs when there’s a tear in the outer layer of the disc, allowing the nucleus pulposus to leak out.          This is most commonly a posterior or posterolateral herniation, because, as we recall the ligament behind the vertebral bodies (the PLL) is weaker than the one in front of the bodies (the ALL).      In addition, since the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine are lordotic, the posterior side of the disc is squished more tightly than the anterior side of the disc, making it more likely to tear.      Hence, cervical and lumbar posterior/posterolateral tears are the most common presentation.      Other names for a herniated disc include: (1) prolapsed disc, (2) ruptured disc and (3) slipped disc.        What clinical findings would you see with a lumbar herniated disc?          Posterior herniation                  Here, the nucleus pulposus presses against the posterior longitudinal ligament, leading to lumbago, aka. low back pain.          This pain is generally local to the back, because it’s caused by the irritation of pain fibres along the PLL.                    Posterolateral herniation.                  Here, the nucleus pulposus protrudes laterally to the PLL, and pushes against a spinal nerve root, leading to sciatica.          Impingement of the sciatic nerve causes pain that radiates to the buttocks, back of the thick, and lateral leg and foot (where the sciatic nerve innervates).          Here, you can do nerve specific tests, to determine the level of the herniation.                    This video is a great review of the differences between the two.        Posterior vs Posterolateral Herniation                             Posterior Herniation        Posterolateral Herniation                            Irritates the:        Posterior Longitudinal Ligament        Spinal nerve root                    Pain characteristics        Local to back        Radiates                    May cause (in lumbar region):        Lumbago        Sciatica            Features of the Cervical Vertebrae  There are some key differences between the cervical vertebrae and vertebrae in other regions.  As mentioned before, you can’t feel the spinous processes above C7, because of the presence of a thick ligament called the ligamentum nuchae.  In addition, there is no intervertebral disc between C1 and C2.  In the C3-C6 vertebrae, the edges of the vertebral bodies push out and form uncinate processes (circled in red above).          Furthermore, the intervertebral discs don’t extend to the very edge of the vertebral bodies here, so a fluid-filled space is formed.      The coupling of this space with the uncinate processes becomes the uncovertebral joints (of Lushka).      This becomes important as you age, because osteophytes commonly form here, leading to uncovertebral osteoarthritis.        These changes may accompany the osteoarthritic changes seen in ankylosing spondylitis and be a cause of chronic neck pain.      In addition, the osteophytes can cause a progressive narrowing of the intervertebral foramen where the spinal nerves and vertebral arteries come out. This can lead to compressive symptoms.      Note that the vertebral foramen is not the same as the intervertebral foramen; the latter is shown to the right, and is bordered by the pedicles and the back of the spinous processes.      Surface Anatomy of the Back  Key surface landmarks include:          Erector spinae → longitudinal muscles on either side of the spine, that keep the back erect.      Posterior Superior Iliac Spine → usually a ‘dimple’ on the back, that aligns to the level of L4/L5. Used to landmark where an epidural/spinal goes.      Extrinsic Muscles of the Back  The most superficial muscles of the back include:          Trapezius → comes off the occipital bone, and covers C1-T12.                  Nerve Supply → CN XI (Spinal Accessory Nerve), and branches from the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves.          Actions → depends on the part. The trapezius has a superior, transverse, and inferior region, which raises, retracts, and depresses the scapula respectively.                    Latissiumus dorsi → merges at the thoracolumbar fascia (the deep fascia of the back).                  Nerve Supply → thoracodorsal nerve.          Actions → adducts and medially rotates the humerus (eg. when you’re doing a pullup).                    Teres major → nicknamed the ‘minor lats’, or baby lats. Functionally similar to the latissimus dorsi.      Deltoid → forms the contours of the shoulder. Attaches to the scapula.        Below (on the right), the trapezius has been removed to reveal deeper muscles.          Here we see the rhomboid minor and rhomboid major muscles, which attach to the medial margin of the scapula.      Above this, we also see the levator scapula, which attaches to the superior angle of the scapula, and, as the name suggests, lifts the scapula.      All 3 of these muscles help retract and keep the scapula close to the vertebral column.      Frop top to bottom, the muscles attach to the scapula as follows:                  Levator scapulae → rhomboid minor → rhomboid major.          These attach to the medial margin of the scapula (1) above the spine of the scapula, (2) at the spine of scapula, and (3) below the spine of scapula respectively.                      Unlabeled on the above image, are the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.           These are the muscles that cover the scapula, and lie above and below the spine of the scapular respectively.      They attach to the greater tubercle of the humerus.      Extrinsic Muscles of the Back                   Origin      Insertion      Action      Innervation                  Trapezius      External occipital protuberance; nuchal ligament and spinous processes of C7-T12      Lateral 1/3 of clavicle, acromion and spine of scapula      Elevates, retracts and rotates scapula; superior fibers elevate, medial fibers retract and inferior fibers depress scapula.      Spinal root of accessory nerve (CN XI and C3, C4)              Latissimus Dorsi      Thoracolumbar fascia      Middle of the bicipital groove of the humerus      Adducts and medially rotates humerus      Thoracodorsal nerve              Levator Scapulae      Transverse processes of C1-C4      Medial scapula above the level of the spine of scapula      Raises the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)              Rhomboid Minor      Spinous processes of C7-T1      Medial scapula at the level of the spine of scapula      Retracts the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)              Rhomboid Major      Spinous processes of T2-T5      Medial scapula below the level of the spine of scapula      Depresses the scapula      Dorsal scapular nerve (C4-C5)      	All of these muscles are innervated by branches of the brachial plexus except for the trapezius	The trapezius is supplied by the spinal accessory nerve, ie. cranial nerve XIIntrinsic Muscles of the Back  The intrinsic muscles of the back affect the vertebral column.  Intrinsic muscles of the back include:          Splenius cervicus → looks like a ‘band-aid’ around the neck; helps keep it upright.      Erector spinae → as mentioned before, this is a long muscle that helps keep the spine upright. However, it’s actually comprised of 3 groups:                  Ileocostalis → has fibres that extend and attach to the ribs (see below)          Longissiumus → longitudinal band of muscle.          Spinalis → closest to the spine.                    To remember the branches of the erector spinae, laterally to medially, remember I LIKE STANDING (ileocostalis, longissimus, spinalis).        What is the innervation of the erector spinae muscles?          This is fairly intuitive: the dorsal rami of the spinal nerves.      If you visualize where the muscles are (right beside and behind the spine), it makes sense that the dorsal rami innervate them!        Remember      The muscles of the erector spinae include:              Ileocostalis        Longissimus        Spinalis              Remember these as I LIKE STANDING.    Deep to the erector spinae, and directly adjacent to the spinal vertebrae, are a group of muscles called transverso-spinalis group of muscles (circled below).          These muscles run obliquely between the transverse processes and spinous processes of the vertebrae.      They help maintain the upright posture and extension of the vertebral column.      As with the erector spinae, these are innervated by the dorsal rami.      The Spinal Cord  The spinal cord originates as an extension of the medulla oblongata in the brainstem, and exits through the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal.  However, the spinal cord does not travel all the way down the vertebral canal; it actually stops at the level of L1/L2.          At this point, the spinal cord tapers into a cone-shaped structure called the conus medullaris.      The space between L1/L2 (where the spinal cord ends), and S2 (where the vertebral canal ends) is referred to as the lumbar cistern.      In the lumbar cistern, the roots of the lumbar and sacral spinal nerves fan outwards, to form the cauda equina (horse’s tail).        Why does the spinal cord end before the vertebral canal does?          Embryologically, the spinal cord continued to the end of the vertebral canal, at S2.      However, as the embryo develops, the vertebral column grows faster relative to the spinal cord.      Hence, just like with the kidneys, this is a ‘relative ascent’.        When a lumbar puncture is done, it’s done at the level of the PSIS (L4/L5). This is because the needle will then enter the lumbar cistern, where it is less likely to puncture something.  Wrapping the entire spinal cord is the meninges, which comprise of the:          Dura mater (dural sac).      Arachnoid mater.      Pia mater → directly envelops the spinal cord and brain.        Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the cerebrospinal fluid, ie. in the subarachnoid space.  Hence, the dura and arachnoid mater lie outside the CSF, while the pia mater lies beneath the CSF. As a result, the outside lining of the spinal cord is often referred to as the dura-arachnoid.Spinal Nerve Roots  Note that there are 7 cervical vertebrae, but 8 cervical nerves:          So the C1 nerve lies above the C1 vertebrae, but C8 actually lies above the T1 vertebrae.      As a result, all of the lower nerves (thoracic, lumbar, sacral, etc) lie below their corresponding vertebrae.      That is, the L3 nerve lies below the L3 vertebrae, and so on and so forth.        Clinical Application:          If a disc herniation occurred between C5 and C6, then the C6 nerve would be affected, since it lies above the C6 vertebrae.      However, if a disc herniation occurred between L3 and L4, then the L3 nerve would be affected, since it lies below the L3 vertebrae.        Remember      Cervical nerves lie above their corresponding vertebrae.    All lower nerves lie below their corresponding vertebrae.    This is because there are 8 cervical nerves, but only 7 cervical vertebrae, resulting in an offset.    Key spinal nerve associations:          C1-C4 → Cervical Plexus.      C3,4,5 → Phrenic Nerve (C3,4,5 keeps your diaphragm alive).      C5-T1 → Brachial plexus (will be seeing this in gory detail soon).      T1-T12 → Intercostal Nerves.      L1-L4 → Lumbar Plexus.      L4-S3 → Sacral Plexus.      S2,3,4 → Pudendal Nerve.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/anatomy-spine.html"},
	{"title": "Approach to the Spine", "text": "Lecture Objectives  To introduce basic spine anatomy  To identify clinically relevant spine anatomy  – I.e. understand how anatomy is important to the assessment and diagnosis of spinal pathology.  To correlate spinal anatomy with clinical assessment and radiographic interpretation.Introduction  The spine is a commonly complained about area for patients, doctors, and students.  The spine is an anatomically complex region.  We’ll be focusing on the big picture, rather than the details:          “Learn the big things rather than the details; this is a generalization that holds good throughout the realm of medicine, and I advise you to evaporate your knowledge not to dryness but to a serviceable bulk. Larger structures, as a rule, are far more important than smaller ones, and moreover will act as guides or ‘rallying‐points’ in calling the latter to mind.” (S.E. Whitnall, 1933)      Anatomic Planes  As we saw in first year:          The sagittal plane splits the body into left and right.      The coronal (frontal) plane splits the body into front and back.      The transverse (axial) plane splits the body into top and bottom.      Spinal Surface Anatomy  The surface anatomy gives you clues as to what’s going on deeper in the body.  Important landmarks include          C7 = vertebral prominence.                  This is the vertebral bump at the base of your neck.          Useful in localizing an injury to a specific vertebral level.                    L4 = typically at the level of the PSIS                  PSIS = Posterior Superior Iliac Spine          Useful when doing spinal anesthesia (ie. an epidural).          When performing an epidural, the patient is also usually flexed (since that increases the space in the vertebral canal). We saw this with Pattern 4 back pain in Family Week.                    Spinal Anatomy  The spinal cord originates from the foramen magnum (the opening in the base of the skull), and tapers down to a cone-like structure called the conus medullaris at the level of L1.          Note that the spinal cord doesn’t go all the way down the vertebral canal; it actually stops at L1.      The remaining nerve roots actually project down past the cord, and fan out to form the cauda equina (the horse’s tail).      This is why the PSIS (at L4) is such a useful landmark; at that point, your needle will be below the spinal cord, so you’re less likely to puncture a nerve.        Remember      The spinal cord originates at the foramen magnum, and ends at the conus medullaris at the level of L1.    The remaining nerve roots then fan out to form the cauda equina.    Cauda Equina Syndrome → when there’s injury to the cauda equina (eg. via compression or trauma).          The most common cause of this is disk herniation.      Since the nerves in the cauda equina innervate the perineum, bladder, anal sphincters, and external genitalia, you end up with corresponding issues.        Dermatome vs Myotome:          Dermatome → the region on the skin that’s covered by a specific nerve root.      Myotome → the muscles that are innervated by a specific nerve root.      Although there’s overlap between the two, they are NOT the same.      Functions of the Spine  Structural support and balance for upright posture.  Protects the spinal cord and neural elements.  Allows for mobility.  To achieve these functions, the spine must be:          Resistant to axial loading forces.      Elastic        Resistance and elasticity are obtained from the alternating kyphotic (humped) and lordotic curves of the spine along the sagittal plane, by acting like a spring.  Kyphosis vs Lordosis      Kyphosis = curved forward. (Kypho- = humped).    Lordosis = curved backward. (Lordo- = curved).    Motion Segment → the functional unit of the spine.  Components of the motion segment include:          2 adjacent vertebrae.      1 intervertebral disc.      2 facet joints.        The motion segments are called ‘motion segments’ because they facilitate the movement of the spine (eg. flexion and extension).Bones and Ligaments of the SpineBones of the Spine  The spine is comprised of vertebrae.  For each vertebrae:           There is a solid body, which is what lies above/below the intervertebral discs.      From this body extends two projections called pedicles.      At the end of these pedicles are transverse processes that stick outwards.      From this, two projections then come together medially and connect to form a spinous process. This is what ‘sticks out of your back’.      The bone that comes from the pedicles to the spinous process is flattened; hence it’s called the lamina.      The gap between the pedicles and the lamina is where the spinal cord will run through; this hole is called the vertebral foramen.      Ligaments of the Spine  Ligament = between bone and bone.  Tendon = between bone and something else (muscle, eye, etc).  There are 5 major ligaments that you need to know about:          Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL):                  As given by the name, this lies anterior to the vertebral bodies.                    Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL):                  This lies just posterior to the vertebral bodies.          Note that this does not lie posterior to the vertebrae themselves; rather it lies just behind the vertebral bodies, on the anterior side of the vertebral foramen.                    Ligamentum Flavum                  This is particularly important, because it’s the strongest ligament in the spine. It helps protect elements in the canal.          Flavum = yellow, so just like its name implies, this ligament is yellow.          This lies on the posterior side of the vertebral foramen.          In other words, the vertebral foramen is covered by the PLL in the front, and the ligamentum flavum in the back.                    Interspinous Ligament                  As the name implies, this ligament wraps between the spinous processes of the spinal vertebrae.                    Supraspinous Ligament                  Just as the name suggests, this wraps over the spinous processes, and is hence the most posterior ligament of the spine.                      This also corresponds to the position of the ligaments anteriorly to posteriorly, ie:          ALL → PLL → ligamentum flavum → interspinous → supraspinous.      This can be better seen in the figure below.        Ligaments of the Spine      Anteriorly to posteriorly, we have the:              Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (ALL)        Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (PLL)        Ligamentum Flavum        Interspinous Ligament        Supraspinous Ligament            Case Presentation  On the top right is a c-spine X-ray of a patient that had a motor vehicle accident.  Note the loss of lordosis compared to the normal c-spine:          Mormally, the cervical spine is lordotic as shown on the left. On the right, note that there’s a relative kyphosis.      This suggests that there’s some injurious process going on.      Furthermore, there’s widening between the spinous processes, further suggesting injury.        The MRI on the right showed fluid entering the spinal column (note the white stuff on the right).          Note that the fluid is tracking from the posterior side of the neck to just outside the spinal cord.      That means that it must have gone through (1) supraspinous ligament and (2) interspinous ligament.      If the fluid had gone into the vertebral canal, then the ligamentum flavum would also have been damaged.      Aging of the Spine  Pain can arise from the joints, discs, nerve roots, or soft tissue of the spine.  As you age, degenerative changes in the spine can exacerbate or cause pain.  Degenerative changes in the spine (both normal and abnormal), include:            Degenerative disc → the discs, which are normally fluid filled, begin to dry out and become dessicated. This makes them less able to deal with weight bearing.      Bulged disc → the disc begins to stick out past the vertebral bodies.      Herniated disc → the gelatinous inner nucleus of the disc extravasates out of the fibrous outer layer.      Thinning disc → as the inner nucleus dries out, the disc becomes thinner.      Disc degeneration with osteophyte formation → as the spine becomes less stable, the vertebral bodies begin to form bone spurs called osteophytes.      Scoliosis  Scoliosis → lateral curvature of the spine &gt;10°.  This involves both a lateral curvature deformity and a rotational deformity.          That is, not only is the spine bent in the coronal plane, it’s also rotated about its axis.        This rotation can be assessed with something known as Adam’s Forward Bend Test:          To perform the test, you have the patient stand up, with their legs and hands together. You then have them bend forward with their head down.      With scoliosis, you’ll see a prominence on one side due to the rotation of the spine. (see image to the right).      In fact, the rotation of the spine actually causes a deformity of the chest wall.      This is why severe scoliosis can present with breathing difficulties!      Adolescent (Idiopathic) Scoliosis  The most common type of scoliosis.  Presentation          Girls &gt; boys, age &gt; 10 years      Presents as a painless curve in spine.        Etiology → not well understood.  Physical Exam          Coronal spinal curvature.      Rib/lumbar prominence (via Adam’s Forward Bend Test).      Rule out neurologic or associated conditions.                  If you have pain, neurologic symptoms, or rapidly progressive scoliosis, then this is atypical, and hence is a red flag.          Hence, these red flags would make an idiopathic scoliosis less likely, and point to an underlying cause (post-traumatic, tumour, or another anatomical cause).                      Treatment          Depends on patient age, growth remaining, progression of the scoliosis, &amp; severity of the curve.      Observation, bracing, surgery.

Objective      Describe the meaning of impairment, disability, and handicap.    Impairment → ‘Any loss or abnormality of psyhological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function’ (WHO).          Functions at an organ level, ie. a problem involving structure or function (eg. torn achilles tendon).        Disability → ‘An activity limitation that creates a difficulty in the performance, accomplishment, or completion of an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being’ (WHO).          Functions at a person level, ie. failing to do a task or activity (eg. can’t walk up stairs).        Handicap → ‘A disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual (WHO).          Functions at a societal level, eg. unable to work as a bar manager.        Objective      Develop alternative approaches to forming the differential diagnosis in MSK disorders.    Integrate some common patterns for MSK disorders from the history into differential formation.    Some approaches include the following:          Inflammatory vs Degenerative.      Anatomic.      Pain characterization.      Presence of Weakness.      Abnormal Sensation.      Root or peripheral nerve cause.        Inflammatory vs Degenerative          Broadly speaking, MSK disorders can be classified as either inflammatory or degenerative.      Inflammatory disorders will present with pain at rest; degenerative disorders will present with pain with activity.        Degenerative vs Inflammatory Features                    Degenerative        Inflammatory                            Pain with activity        Pain at rest                    May report stiffness        Morning stiffness                    Locking        Swelling                    Instability        Warmth                    May have weakness        Rash                    Swelling? (secondary)        Malaise                             Fever / weight loss / constitutional symptoms              Anatomic          Differential may be highly anatomically based.      Use the ‘generic joint’ → what do all joints have in common?      Apply this to specific joint tissues → ligaments, muscles/tendons, nerves.      Note: # is shorthand for fracture.        Pain Characterization          Pain may be single most common spoken word in musculoskeletal medicine      There are various approaches to take the ‘pain history’ (eg. OPQRST). Another one is ‘OLD CARS’:                  Onset.          Location.          Duration.          Characteristics (quality, severity).          Aggrevating/alleviating.          Radiation.          Symptoms (elsewhere/related).                    Consider the below 4 patients, all presenting with R wrist pain. From the history, we can see that they have very different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis.          Scaphoid Fracture          Rheumatoid Arthritis.          Septic joint.                      Weakness          Weakness is an exceedingly common complaint when pain is involved → if it hurts, you don’t want to move it (hence you have weakness).      Difficulty 1 → is it weakness, or pain, or both?                  Pain without weakness is common.          Painless weakness limits the differential.                    Difficulty 2 → if it’s true weakness, what is causing it? (see possible structures below)        Below are 3 patients, each presenting with foot weakness. Again, they have different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  Tibialis anterior rupture.          Common peroneal neuropathy.          ACA stroke.                      Abnormal Sensation          Abnormal sensation suggests a peripheral nerve injury, which may result in paradoxical sensory changes:                  Increased/spontaneous sensation.          Diminished functional sensation.                    However, tingling and/or outright pain may have a number of causative tissue impairments (eg. nerve, muscle, tendon, bone/joint, referred, etc).      BUT true sensory loss is ALWAYS neurogenic → on P/E, you have to differentiate this from ‘numbness’, which is often vaguely defined by the patient.        Roots vs Peripheral Nerves          Consider the case of a ‘numb thumb’ (frequent tingles, diminished 2-pt discrimination).      Two things in the DDx should include:                  Carpal tunnel syndrome.          C6 Radiculopathy (root level pathology).                    So do we inject their risk, or MRI their neck?      Why are both of these in the differential?                  The C6 nerve root travels down the arm, and becomes the median nerve (which is involved in carpal tunnel syndrome).          The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the thumb, as well as motor innervation to the APB (Abductor Pollicus Brevis muscle at the base of the thumb).          The C6 nerve root also branches into the musculocutaneous nerve, which provides  motor innervation to the biceps.                    Hence, by looking at associated symptoms (eg. biceps weakness), you can help refine your diagnosis!          Root vs. Peripheral Nerve          Nerve roots are not the same as peripheral nerves!      These are similar but not the same; an important concept in MSK/nerve injury.      You must be able to differentiate:                   Dermatome from peripheral nerve territory.          Myotome from peripheral nerve territory.                    For instance, compare the region of innervation of the median nerve (which braches off of C6), and the C6 dermatome (note that these are different):        ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/concepts-musculoskeletal-medicine.html"},
