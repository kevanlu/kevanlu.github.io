Describe the meaning of impairment, disability, and handicap.  Develop alternative approaches to forming the differential diagnosis in MSK disorders.  Integrate some common patterns for MSK disorders from the history into differential formation.  Objective      Learn the importance of history taking in musculoskeletal disorders.    Estimated 90% of the diagnosis is based on accurate history  Likely similar to other clinical areas  Need to form hypothesis on which to base:          Physical exam      Investigations      Treatments        Leads to efficient and effective practice.  Objective      Describe the meaning of impairment, disability, and handicap.    Impairment → ‘Any loss or abnormality of psyhological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function’ (WHO).          Functions at an organ level, ie. a problem involving structure or function (eg. torn achilles tendon).        Disability → ‘An activity limitation that creates a difficulty in the performance, accomplishment, or completion of an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being’ (WHO).          Functions at a person level, ie. failing to do a task or activity (eg. can’t walk up stairs).        Handicap → ‘A disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual (WHO).          Functions at a societal level, eg. unable to work as a bar manager.        Objective      Develop alternative approaches to forming the differential diagnosis in MSK disorders.    Integrate some common patterns for MSK disorders from the history into differential formation.    Some approaches include the following:          Inflammatory vs Degenerative.      Anatomic.      Pain characterization.      Presence of Weakness.      Abnormal Sensation.      Root or peripheral nerve cause.        Inflammatory vs Degenerative          Broadly speaking, MSK disorders can be classified as either inflammatory or degenerative.      Inflammatory disorders will present with pain at rest; degenerative disorders will present with pain with activity.        Degenerative vs Inflammatory Features                    Degenerative        Inflammatory                            Pain with activity        Pain at rest                    May report stiffness        Morning stiffness                    Locking        Swelling                    Instability        Warmth                    May have weakness        Rash                    Swelling? (secondary)        Malaise                             Fever / weight loss / constitutional symptoms              Anatomic          Differential may be highly anatomically based.      Use the ‘generic joint’ → what do all joints have in common?      Apply this to specific joint tissues → ligaments, muscles/tendons, nerves.        Pain Characterization          Pain may be single most common spoken word in musculoskeletal medicine      There are various approaches to take the ‘pain history’ (eg. OPQRST). Another one is ‘OLD CARS’:                  Onset.          Location.          Duration.          Characteristics (quality, severity).          Aggrevating/alleviating.          Radiation.          Symptoms (elsewhere/related).                    Consider the below 4 patients, all presenting with R wrist pain. From the history, we can see that they have very different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  DeQuervain’s Tenosynovitis.          Scaphoid Fracture          Rheumatoid Arthritis.          Septic joint.                      Weakness          Weakness is an exceedingly common complaint when pain is involved → if it hurts, you don’t want to move it (hence you have weakness).      Difficulty 1 → is it weakness, or pain, or both?                  Pain without weakness is common.          Painless weakness limits the differential.                    Difficulty 2 → if it’s true weakness, what is causing it? (see possible structures below)        Below are 3 patients, each presenting with foot weakness. Again, they have different etiologies:        More specifically, they had:                  Tibialis anterior rupture.          Common peroneal neuropathy.          ACA stroke.                      Abnormal Sensation          Abnormal sensation suggests a peripheral nerve injury, which may result in paradoxical sensory changes:                  Increased/spontaneous sensation.          Diminished functional sensation.                    However, tingling and/or outright pain may have a number of causative tissue impairments (eg. nerve, muscle, tendon, bone/joint, referred, etc).      BUT true sensory loss is ALWAYS neurogenic → on P/E, you have to differentiate this from ‘numbness’, which is often vaguely defined by the patient.        Roots vs Peripheral Nerves          Consider the case of a ‘numb thumb’ (frequent tingles, diminished 2-pt discrimination).      Two things in the DDx should include:                  Carpal tunnel syndrome.          C6 Radiculopathy (root level pathology).                    So do we inject their risk, or MRI their neck?      Why are both of these in the differential?                  The C6 nerve root travels down the arm, and becomes the median nerve (which is involved in carpal tunnel syndrome).          The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the thumb, as well as motor innervation to the APB (Abductor Pollicus Brevis muscle at the base of the thumb).          The C6 nerve root also branches into the musculocutaneous nerve, which provides  motor innervation to the biceps.                    Hence, by looking at associated symptoms (eg. biceps weakness), you can help refine your diagnosis!          Root vs. Peripheral Nerve          Nerve roots are not the same as peripheral nerves!      These are similar but not the same; an important concept in MSK/nerve injury.      You must be able to differentiate:                   Dermatome from peripheral nerve territory.          Myotome from peripheral nerve territory.                    For instance, compare the region of innervation of the median nerve (which braches off of C6), and the C6 dermatome (note that these are different):        ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/concepts-musculoskeletal-medicine.html"},

Online submission due on Wednesday of the final week.                    5% Quizzes                  Based on 10 formative online quizzes.          You need 80% to progress to the next quiz.          Once all 10 are completed, you get full marks (5%).          Can repeat the quizzes as often as you like (the highest mark is accepted).          Do not leave this until the end of the course; follow the suggested deadlines!          Also due online Wednesday of the final week.                    25% End of Course Exam                  Friday of the final week.          Will cover everything in the course; exam content differs from year to year.                    15% Anatomy Bell Ringer                  Focus on anatomy/clinical relevance.          On Friday the 13th (duh duh duh).                    35% End of Semester Exam                  Will focus more on clinical material.          Questions will often relate to one another (similar to clinical vignettes).          There will be a mock bellringer, on the Monday night of that week.          You can never know enough Anatomy; please use the labs well (they’re open to you 24/7).                      60% on every component required to pass.More About Anatomy  Start now, stay on top of it, finish strong.  Anatomy might be the only thing you study in med school that never changes during your career!  Classroom teaching will focus on highlights, fundamentals, and problem areas; cannot cover everything.  For those without an anatomy background:          Need to quickly get up to speed with an intro module.      Get this done soon!      Why study MSK?  Musculoskeletal Conditions:          Comprise the 2nd most common reason for physician visits.      The 2nd most common self-reported chronic condition among patients.      Have the greatest negative impact on health-related QoL in the industrialized world.        In 2003, only 42% of US med schools had a formal MSK block; MSK was rated highly importance but poorly in confidence and knowledge testing.Schedule  Top down organization.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/musculoskeletal/2015/01/19/intro-msk.html"},
