<ul>
  <li>Describe normal curvatures of the spine.</li>
  <li>Identify the key features of vertebral column and compare various views of radiographic images.</li>
  <li>Identify and describe the joints and ligaments of the vertebral
column, including the intervertebral discs, zygopophyseal, sacroiliac joint.</li>
  <li>List the muscles that support the back</li>
  <li>Describe the Spinal Cord in Relation to the Vertebral Column and the clinical significance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spinal-anatomy"><strong>Spinal Anatomy</strong></h2>

<p>The vertebral column is made up of a curved series of bones.
These bones are held together by ligaments and joints.
7 in C
12 in thoracic.
6 in lumbar
6 in sacral (<em>fused to form the sacrum</em>).
3-5 coccygeal (fused to form the coccyx, or tailbone).
- Vestigial, so the number may vary.</p>

<p>Running through the center is the vertebral canal which houses and protects the spinal cord.</p>

<p>The vertebral column.
Intervertebral disks get thicker and thicker as we move caudally.
THERE IS NO INTERVERTEBRAL DISK BETWEEN C1 AND C2.
Harder to feel spinous processes in neck because there’s a ligament in between.</p>

<p>BETWEEN vertebral bodies ARE INTERVERTEBRAL DISKS.
How many processes extend from each vertebral body?
	7!?
C1 does not have a body. It’s shaped like a ring. Balances the globe, hence known as the atlas.
C2 extends into C1, has an extension known as the audentoid process!?!?
C7 = vertebra prominens.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4sm4d57annqq50o/e5z4l3cq.png" /></p>

<h2 id="normal-curvatures-of-the-spine"><strong>Normal Curvatures of the Spine</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>During develpoment, primary ‘C’ shaped curvature of spine: kyphotic curve.</li>
  <li>Hence anything like that (kyphosis) = PRIMARY curvature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lumbar lordosis more prominently in females, hence more butt stick.</p>

<p>Excessive = scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis.</p>

<p>FEATURES OF THE VERTEBRA
Typicall vertebra
1 = body. (smaller in cervical region, heart shaped in thoracic, kidney shaped in lumbar -&gt; MATCHES THE ORGANS THERE).
Body is suspended by 2 stems that project posteriorly (2 = pedicle).
Continues as a flattened piece of bone posteriorly called the LAMINA (ie. leaf-like, 3).
Between that is the vertebral foramen (all aligned, so form vertebral canal all the way down).
5. Suprior articular process + facet.
6. Interior articular process + facet.
5 and 6 of the two adjacent vertebra interdigitate to form a SYNOVIAL JOINT.
At this point lets us to lateral rotation (rotating side to side). NOT BUILT FOR WEIGHT BEARING.
7. Facet (zygapophyseal) joint = synovial joint!?!
8. Transverse process → project out to the sides (cervical!?!?!) thoracic, has ribs there. Inferiorly, in lumbar, becomes slender (muscles attach). 
9. Spinous process (thoracic = downwards? lumbar = horizontal!?)
10. Intervertebral disks.</p>

<p>Ligaments 
- Anterior longitudinal ligament along anterior margin, broad ligament, sacrum to foramen magnum!?
- Tough ligament, opposing anterior push of vertebrae.
- Posterior longitudinal ligament is NOT AS STRONG, sort of fuses with the intervertebral discs posteriorly.
- CIRCLED IS FACET JOINT (synovial joint).
- Interspinous ligament = more flexible.
- Less flexible ligament = supraspinous ligament (longitudinal band surrounding spine?!)
- Ligamentum flavum (yellow) = fibrocartilage, between adjacent laminae.
	- When would you have to pierce this clinically?
	- When accessing the vertebral canal! (spinal tap, epidural).
	- Why is this a safe spot? Recall that in the vertebral canal, we also have blood vessels. Most blood vessels are present anteriorly, so less bleeding.
- CORRELATE WITH X-RAY IMAGES.</p>

<p>AP View, can see spinous process between, pedicels (stalks just posterior to body!?!)</p>

<p>Intervertebral Disk (Nutrition)
Notochord -&gt; neural tube.
Vertebral column forms around neural tube.
Notochord gets absorbed into vertebral column, represented as soft part of intervertebral disk.
Outside of intervertebral disk, number of sheets of fibrocartilage. In center is gelatinous substance (nucleus pulposus), REMNANT OF NOTOCHORD.
No blood supply feeding intervertebral discs themselves, so nutrition to discs are from adjacent vessels.
	- In loaded state (seated/standing), intervertebral discs are compressed, forces H2O molecules out, absorbed by surrounding capillaries.
	- In unloaded state (lying down), intervertebral discs (nourishment, etc) gushes back into the discs.
	- This transmission of fluid in and out explains why you’re taller with some rest.
	- 25% of vertebral length is the disk length itself! So this change can be somewhat substantial.
- Tear in intervertebral disc is typically posterior (posterior ligament is NOT AS STRONG, recall. Thin band).</p>

<p>Due in part to the curvatures of the vertebral column, particularly in the cervical and
lumbar regions, the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc is thicker and therefore
stronger anteriorly, but thinner and weaker posteriorly. Therefore, when subjected to
stresses as in twisting and bending the trunk during weight‐bearing, the posterior, weaker
part of the annulus is much more likely to tear or get disrupted than the stronger anterior
part, leading to posterior or posterolateral prolapse of the nucleus pulposus</p>

<p>Lumbar herniation:
Push against posterior longitudinal ligament. Can’t pinpoint, since felt through ligament.
Push against spinal cord (sciatica). Can test specific nerve, determine level of herniation.</p>

<p>CERVICAL REGION
Can’t feel spinous process, between of presence of thick ligament there.
Ligamentum nuchae there.
What else is different?
C1 &amp; C2, no intervertebral disc.
C1 = ring shaped, atlas.
C2 = tooth like projection into C1, articulating with it. Odontoid process?
Edges of body are pushing out and forming hooks at the sides (UNCINATE PROCESS) = C3-C6.
	- Intervertebral disc doesn’t go as far, forming a space.
	- Known as the Uncocervical joints (of Lushka).
	- See pic on right.
	- See exposed faces (uncovertebral joints). 
	- Why important? In osteoarthritis, this is where osteophytes may occur.
The intervertebral discs themselves are </p>

<p>SURFACE ANATOMY OF THE BACK
Posterior superior iliac spine (L4/L5, ‘dimple’)
Erector spinae (just immediately lateral), longitudinal muscles keeping back erect.
Trapezius (shoulder shrugger, different bodies).
Lat dorsi (wings).
Teres major (minor lats, nicknamed as ‘baby lats’, functionally similar to lat dorsi).
Deltoid.</p>

<p>Extrinsic Muscles of the Back.
Superficial to deep:
Trapezius and lat dorsi most superficially.
Trap comes of occipital bone. C1 all the way to T12.
Latissimus dorsi, merge at thoracolumbar fascia (deep fascia of back). Also takes origin from lower 6 spines of thoracic vertebrae. Affects shoulder joint.
Deltoid attaches to scapula.</p>

<p>On right, taken off trapezius.
All muscles that have to do with the shoulder joint.
Called extrinsic muscles of the back (not actually involved in movements of the back!?).
Levator scapulae (raises scapula).
Rhomboids minor and Rhomboids major. Attach to medial margin of scapula.
Levator scapulae above level of spine.
Rhomboids minor is at level of spine.
Rhomboids major below spine.
Retracts scapula, keep them close to vertebral column. All 3.</p>

<p>Above spine = supraspinatus?!?
Below spine = infraspinatus?!?</p>

<p>IMPORTANT STUFF:</p>

<p>Ligamentum Nuchae is a strong fan‐shaped fibroelastic band stretching from the external
occipital protuberance down to and between all the seven cervical vertebral spines.
First Layer of extrinsic muscles
1) Trapezius muscle is flat and triangular in shape. It lies superficially on the back of the
neck and thorax and attaches the scapula to the trunk.
Nerve Supply ‐ The accessory nerve (cranial nerve 11) and branches from the 3rd and 4th
cervical nerves.
Actions ‐ raises the scapula, retraction of scapula, depression of scapula, rotation of
scapula so that the glenoid fossa is raised.
2) Latissimus Dorsi is a large muscle which passes from the middle of the back to the
upper end of the humerus.
Nerve Supply ‐ Thoracodorsal nerve
Actions ‐ Adducts and medially rotates the humerus. Extends the shoulder joint from the
flexed position.</p>

<p>Second Layer Muscles (these muscles are deep to the trapezius muscle and act on the scapula)
The Levator Scapulae and the Rhomboids run from the cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae
to the medial aspect of the scapula.
Levator Scapulae: Nerve Supply ‐ branches from the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves and the dorsal
scapula nerve.
Rhomboid Major and Minor form one quadrilateral muscle with the minor lying superiorly.
Nerve Supply ‐ dorsal scapular nerve.
Actions ‐ the above three muscles act together to elevate and rotate the scapula so that the
glenoid fossa is directed downward.</p>

<p>ALL SUPPLIED BY BRACHIAL PLEXUS EXCEPT TRAPEZIUS (SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE, Cranial Nerve 11).</p>

<p>INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF BACK 
- Affect vertebral column.
- Splenius cervicus (band-aid, around neck, keeps upright).
- Long muscle, attaching to ribs, called erector spinae (broadly, as a group).
- Work together, but are divided into 3 columns:
	- Iliocostalis.
	- Longissimus (longitudinal column/band)
	- Spinalis (close to spine)
	- I LIKE STANDING = muscle used to stand/sit upright.
- Diagram also shows nerve supply.
	- Posterior rami of spinal nerves.</p>

<p>DEEP GROUP OF MUSCLE between transverse process and body!?
Filled with deep muscles, known as Transverso-spinalis muscles.
Don’t need to know individual names/attachments.
But need to know that they manage FINER MOVEMENTS OF FLEXION.
Major movement muscle = erector spinae.</p>

<p>LATERAL VIEW OF VERTEBRAL COLUMN
- See entire spinal cord. (extension of medulla oblongata, foramen magnum!?)
- L1/L2 is end of spinal cord?!
	- C7 = vertebra proiments.
	- The dura mater (dural sac) and
arachnoid mater end
approximately at the level of S2
vertebra. The subarachnoid
space between the termination
of the spinal cord at L1‐L2 and
S2 is referred to as the lumbar
cistern and contains the roots of
the lumbar and sacral spinal
nerves which are called the
cauda equina because of their
resemblance to a horse’s tail.</p>

<p>Meninges = dura + arachnoid mater.
Normally can’t separate them, because fluid fills subarachnoid space, and pushes the dura and arachnoid mater.
This changes when dead, fluid gone.
Hence, call them the ‘dura-arachnoid covering’.
Subarachnoid space filled with cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

<p>7 cervical vertebrae, but EIGHT cervical nerves.
So C1 nerve above C1 vertebrae, and C8 nerve below C7 vertebrae.
This shifts all the lower nerves BELOW.
	- Hence L3 nerve is BELOW L3, at level of L4!?!</p>

<p>C5-T1 = brachial plexus!?! Upper limbs.
L1-L4 = lumbar plexus.
L45S123 = sacral plexus.
Lumbar+ sacral = lower limbs.
S234 = pudendal nerve (perineum)
S5, and coccygeal nerves.</p>

<p>REMEMBER
SPINAL CORD STOPS AT L1-L2.
EVERYTHING BELOW THAT IS A LARGE SPACE FILLED WITH CSF.
DURA MATER AND ARACHNOID EXTEND TO SACRAL AREA THOUGH.
The difference is due to differential growth of spinal vertebrae vs. cord. 
the fluid filled space = LUMBAR CISTERN.
Conus medullaris (end of spinal cord).
Lumbar puncture/lumbar tap at L4 (around POSTERIOR SUPERIOR ILIAC SPINE, RECALL).
IN LUMBAR CISTERN, hence safe since not directly at spinal cord.</p>
