<blockquote>
  <h4 id="neck-pain-case"><strong>Neck Pain Case</strong></h4>
  <p>A 43 year-old painter comes to see you about her severe neck pain. She tells you that her symptoms started about four weeks ago when she began working for a new client and had to assemble scaffolding on the first day. When she woke the next morning, she had pain in the lower neck on the right side rated 9 of 10. Since the onset of the pain, she has been unable to fully extend her neck. She tells you that occasionally the pain radiates across the shoulder or into her midback. She also tells you that she experiences headaches related to the neck pain. Her review of systems and past medical history is otherwise unremarkable.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>List your top 5 differential diagnoses for this patient’s presentation</em>.
    <ol>
      <li>Cervical radiculopathy.</li>
      <li>Myofascial pain.</li>
      <li>Disc pain.</li>
      <li>Facet joint pain.</li>
      <li>Osteoarthritis.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="physical-exam-findings"><strong>Physical Exam Findings</strong></h4>
  <p>On physical exam, there are no fasciculations or atrophy. Her reflexes are 2+ on the left and on the right. Strength testing is equal bilaterally. Range of motion of the neck is limited by pain, especially in extension and rotation. Spurling’s maneuver is negative. The patient has tenderness to palpation over the paraspinal muscles and over the facet joints. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>What is the most likely diagnosis given this patient’s presentation?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Facet joint pain</strong> → since there’s tenderness over the <i>facet joints</i>.</li>
      <li>Normal reflexes and strength suggest that it’s not a neuronal problem (upper motor neuron will cause hyperreflexia, lower motor neuron will cause delayed reflexes).</li>
      <li><em>Spurling’s maneuver</em> → laterally rotate and flex the patient’s head, and press down on the top of their head to impinge the nerve.
        <ul>
          <li>If there’s pre-existing nerve root compression, this will result in pain.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>If this patient’s findings had included ataxia, pain radiating into her legs, tingling or pins-and-needles sensation in the legs, and new onset urinary incontinence, what would the most likely diagnosis be?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spinal root compression</strong>, eg. due to a disc herniation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What tests may be helpful in arriving at a definitive diagnosis?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Primarily by Hx and P/E, especially if there are no neurologic deficits.</li>
      <li>Plain films (XRs) and obliques (showing the ‘Scottie Dog’) may help localize the issue to the facet joints.</li>
      <li>MRI is the best (but most expensive and difficult to get) test with spinal issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What management would you recommend for this patient?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Conservative management; ice, rest, NSAIDs.</li>
      <li>Short term neck support (long-term neck support may weaken the surrounding muscles).</li>
      <li>If there’s no response to conservative therapy, other interventions like <em>intra-articular injections</em> or <em>medial branch rhizotomies</em> can be considered.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="case-2">Case #2</h1>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="back-pain-case"><strong>Back Pain Case</strong></h4>
  <p>A 28-year-old male construction worker injured his back while moving a piece of heavy machinery. He was flexed and rotated at the time of the injury. The doctor in the walk-in clinic put him on one week of bed rest but even after that, pain in the low back region has been unremitting. Numerous radiological investigations are all negative. The pain is localized to the low back with mild radiation to the buttocks. Tenderness is present quite diffusely over the low back. Pain is worse on lumbar extension. Neurological examination is normal.</p>

  <p>You, a physiatrist with many years of experience, are now seeing him 12 weeks post-injury. He has been unable to return to work. He has gained 10 pounds. He takes 12 Tylenol #3s per day. He has difficulty sleeping because of the pain and lately because of financial worries. He spends most of his time watching TV. He smokes a pack per day, and drinks 3-4 alcoholic beverages and 5 cups of coffee per day.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><em>What are the most probable diagnoses of his back pain?</em> (think anatomically)
    <ul>
      <li>Facet joint pain.</li>
      <li>Disc herniation.</li>
      <li>Spinal stenosis.</li>
      <li>Myofascial pain.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the significance of back pain that is worse with extension?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Pattern 1B or 2 back pain.</li>
      <li>Increases likelihood that this is related to the spine (ie. facet joint pain, spondylolisthesis, disk herniation, etc).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What are risk factors for chronic low back pain? What features in this patient’s history predisposed him to chronic pain?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Psychosocial factors.</li>
      <li>Inability to return to work.</li>
      <li>Sedentary lifestyle.</li>
      <li>Smoking/alcohol use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>From a medical point of view, what is the impact of this injury on the patient? What is the psychological impact?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Medical impact</em> → drug dependence, impaired IADLs, impact on QALYs.</li>
      <li><em>Psychological impact</em> → affects mood, self-esteem, financial security, sense of purpose, and sleep.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What medications or modalities may be beneficial here? What other allied health professionals may be helpful in managing this patient?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Stretches, core conditioning, and PT.</li>
      <li>Injection therapy.</li>
      <li>Social work, PT, OT.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>He wants to see a chiropractor and asks your opinion. Discuss.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Chiropractic care can help; they can often counsel patients about exercise as well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="shoulder-pain-case"><strong>Shoulder Pain Case</strong></h4>
  <p>A 43-year-old right-handed painter comes to see you complaining of gradual left shoulder pain, which began about two months ago. Lately she has had difficulty in reaching for the doorknob and lifting objects. The pain awakens her at night. The pain was preceded by an unusually heavy workload, but she did not want to turn down the jobs and feels she may have overworked herself. At the present time she is between painting jobs and is taking coated ASA on an as-necessary basis. She is on no other medication and does not have a previous history of shoulder injury. </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><em>Based on this patient’s history, what is your top 3 differential diagnosis for her shoulder pain?</em>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Rotator Cuff Disease</em>.</li>
      <li>Arthritis.</li>
      <li>Shoulder instability.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="physical-exam-findings-1"><strong>Physical Exam Findings</strong></h4>
  <p>On examination of the left shoulder, there is normal bulk, tone, and strength present distally in the arm and sensation is intact. Pain is increased by resisted external rotation and abduction of the left shoulder. There are tender points just anterior and distal to the tip of the acromion of left shoulder. The left trapezius is also tender compared to the right. There is restricted active range of movement with internal rotation limited to 45° and abduction limited in active range to 90° with a painful arc present. Passive ROM is reasonably full with slight limitation related to pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><em>Based on the physical exam findings, what is the most likely diagnosis? What is the significance of the restricted range of motion?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rotator Cuff Disease</strong>.</li>
      <li>The restricted active RoM and the normal passive RoM suggest that there’s no joint issue, but there is a soft tissue problem.</li>
      <li>Pain with abduction (supraspinatus) and external rotation (infraspinatus) further suggests a rotator cuff issue. Same with the positive painful arc sign.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Design a practical treatment approach for this patient.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Physiotherapy → strengthening the shoulder joint.</li>
      <li>Activity modification → don’t do things that make the shoulder hurt.</li>
      <li>Pain management → NSAIDs.</li>
      <li>If 12 weeks of conservative Tx fails, injections and surgery can be considered.
        <ul>
          <li>Surgical modalities include subacromial decompression, or RC repair if there’s any cuff tearing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>If her findings had been the same except for diffuse active and
passive ROM restriction, most notably on external rotation, what
would be the most likely diagnosis?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Arthritis</em>, since both the passive RoM and active RoM are affected, suggesting a joint issue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="thigh-pain-case"><strong>Thigh Pain Case</strong></h4>
  <p>A 57-year-old woman presents with pain in the left thigh area. The pain has been coming on gradually and although she had a fall two years earlier, she did not notice this pain until six months ago. The pain is made worse by walking and by climbing stairs. When arising from a period of resting, the pain and stiffness is initially worse. The pain is relieved initially by walking several steps but the pain returns after the patient has been walking for greater than five minutes. She is unable to sleep on her left side and frequently awakens with this pain. On examination, this is a healthy-appearing 57-year-old woman. The pain is reproduced by resisted abduction. Local tenderness is present over the greater trochanter of the left hip. There is decreased hip internal rotation on the left. There is a slightly antalgic gait, and a slight Trendelenberg gait. The lumbar spine is slightly restricted and painful especially with extension. There is no other wasting or weakness. Neurological exam is normal.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><em>What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? List 3 other diagnoses you should consider.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hip Adductor Tendonitis</strong>.</li>
      <li>Arthritis.</li>
      <li>Bursitis.</li>
      <li>Referred pain from the joint above (spine) or below (knee).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the cause of her presentation?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Her previous fall caused her to use one side of her body more, resulting in the hip adductor tendonitis (gluteus medius, gluteus minimus).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What investigations are appropriate?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Rule out red flags → weight loss, systemic symptoms, saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder problems, etc etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Design a practical treatment approach.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Similar to before; PT, activity modification, ice, NSAIDs, etc.</li>
      <li>If you suggest a cane, tell them to use it on the <i>opposite site</i> of the injured hip (it gives you another fulcrum on which you can put your weight).</li>

  <h4 id="knee-pain-case"><strong>Knee Pain Case</strong></h4>
  <p>A 16-year-old female presents with gradual onset (over a three-month period) of pain in the right knee, which is increased by activity, particularly by climbing stairs. She gives no history of the knee locking and has not injured it in any known way. She notes that when she is doing physical activities, such as playing volleyball, she gets pain and “cracking” when she squats. When she sits for a while and then stands, it often causes pain. On examination, this is a healthy appearing person but there is local tenderness along the medial and lateral borders of the patella. Patella grinding is present (positive patella grind test) when the patella is pressed against the femur and pain is elicited by resisted leg extension from a fully flexed position. The Q angle measures 15E bilaterally. Other aspects of examination of the knee are normal.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><em>What is the most likely diagnosis?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patellofemoral pain syndrome</strong>, especially considering her age.</li>
      <li>Gradual onset, affected by activity, and there’s a positive patella grind test.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Why does the pain come on with exercise or after sitting?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>During exercise, there’s knee extensor load, which exacerbates pressure in the patellofemoral joint.</li>
      <li>After sitting, the force needed to get up and extend the knee does the same thing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Outline the principles of management.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Conservative Tx, just like before.</li>
      <li>Little supporting evidence for other treatment modalities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <h4 id="knee-injury-case"><strong>Knee Injury Case</strong></h4>
  <p>A 20 year-old wide receiver comes to see you after injuring his left knee in practice about an hour ago. He tells you that during practice, he was running route drills, practicing his cuts, when he changed direction, pivoted and heard a “pop” before he suddenly collapsed on the field in pain. His teammates also said they heard a pop and helped him into your office. He does not have a history of knee injuries or instability, and is otherwise healthy and in excellent physical shape. While in the waiting room, he took 2 Advil, but is otherwise on no medications and has no known medical conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><em>Based on the history, what are your top 5 differential diagnoses for this patient?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>ACL tear.</em></li>
      <li>PCL tear.</li>
      <li>MCL tear.</li>
      <li>LCL tear.</li>
      <li>Meniscus tear.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>How can you differentiate between these diagnoses during your physical exam? What tests will be useful? Will you be able to perform them?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>ACL tear</em> → anterior drawer test, Lachman maneuver.</li>
      <li><em>PCL tear</em> → posterior drawer test, sag sign.</li>
      <li><em>Lateral/Medial tear</em> → varus/valgus stress test.</li>
      <li><em>Meniscus tear</em> → McMurray test.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="physical-exam-findings-2"><strong>Physical Exam Findings</strong></h4>
  <p>On physical exam, the patient’s left knee is slightly swollen compared to the right. He is in significant pain, but allows you to perform several tests. Notably, there is significant anterior laxity on both the Lachman and anterior drawer. When palpating his joint line, he tells you that it is not more tender than the rest of his knee. Varus and valgus stress tests are painful but not lax. There is no sag sign and the posterior drawer is negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><em>What investigations will you perform?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>XR → check to see that there’s no avulsion fracture.</li>
      <li>MRI → for ligament/cartilage damage.</li>
      <li>CT → if MRI is not available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Outline an acute management strategy for this patient.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>P/E is suggestive of an <strong>ACL Tear</strong>.</li>
      <li>Short term, you try to maintain the strength of the knee and prevent contractures while swelling goes down.</li>
      <li>NSAIDs and braces can be used as well.</li>
      <li>Surgical repair is undergone when swelling and inflammation has gone down, particular since this patient is an athlete.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>*Outline a long-term management strategy for this patient. *
    <ul>
      <li>Post-operatively, PT is needed to strengthen the surrounding muscles, and to prevent compensatory overuse of the contralateral knee.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <h4 id="flexion-contracture-case"><strong>Flexion Contracture Case</strong></h4>
  <p>A 44 year-old businessman undergoes a laprascopic cholecystectomy; unfortunately, he experiences a number of complications during and after the surgery and must be admitted to the ICU. One month after his ICU admission, he has plantarflexion contractures and heel ulcers.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><em>What are flexion contractures?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Shortening of the connective tissue of a muscle, resulting in a reduced RoM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What are 5 risk factors for flexion contractures?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Immobility.</li>
      <li>Injury.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What are the 3 most common flexion contractures?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>The 3 most common flexion contractures are the ankle, knee, and elbow.</li>
      <li>It’s thought that this is because the corresponding muscles cross 2 joints:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Knee</em> → hamstrings (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps femoris).</li>
          <li><em>Ankle</em> →</li>
          <li><em>Elbow</em> → biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What impact do flexion contractures have on patients’ functional status and return to ambulation? Provide examples for different joints.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>These are common sense.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is your management strategy for this patient?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Stretching, work on passive RoM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>How can flexion contractures be prevented in patients with known risk factors such as lengthy anticipated ICU stays?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Motility; avoid the preventable risk factors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
