Case #1  Case Summary  Nadia is a 4 month old girl who is brought into the emergency department by her parents with symptoms of lethargy and difficulty breathing. They tell you that Nadia was well until yesterday when she developed symptoms of clear nasal discharge, cough and a low- grade fever. Over the course of yesterday her condition worsened with the development of wheezing, noisy breathing, irritability and poor feeding. Nadia’s parents tell you that she did not sleep well last night due to cough and has vomited her last two feeds. Today she does not seem herself, is less irritable but not very interested in her surroundings and she seems to be breathing faster than normal.   What are important points to get on history?          Make sure the patient is stable; ABCs first.      One useful mnemonic is AMPLE:      A → Allergies.      M → Medications.      P → Past Medical History.      L → Last meal.      E → Events (surrounding the presentation); HPI.        Physical Examination      Upon examination you see an ill looking child with respiratory distress.              HR: 180.        RR: 80.        BP: 70/45.        Temp: 38.1°C.        O2 sat: 83% in room air.              Nadia is now very restless and her parents are unable to settle her. There are intercostal and suprasternal retractions. There are decreased breath sounds with a faint, audible wheeze.     What is the significance of these P/E findings?          O2 sats below 92% → respiratory failure.      Patient is tachycardic, tachypneic, and mildly afebrile.      Patient is using accessory muscles to help breathing.      Wheezing suggests that this is a lower airway problem; pneumonia, asthma.        Why is it particularly important to identify respiratory compromise in infants and children?          In children, respiratory failure can lead to cardiac arrest, unlike in adults (where this is usually a heart-specific problem).      The prognosis for cardiac arrest in children is poor, but it’s quite good for respiratory failure.      So it’s best to treat these children early!        What is the physiologic response to decreased tissue oxygenation in infants and young children? How does this differ from adults?          Unlike adults, children are unable to increase their stroke volume in order to compensate for reduced tissue oxygenation.      Hence, children will only present with tachycardia.      Recall that .      Similarly, although children can increase their respiratory rate, they cannot increase their tidal volume effectively.        Respiratory failure can be hypoxemic or hypercarbic or both. How does this occur?          Hypoxemic → inability to add O2 to the blood, eg. due to V/Q mismatch, or acute filling or collapse of the alveoli.      Hypercarbic → inability to clear CO2 from the alveoli (due to impaired breathing such as with a drug overdose, or mechanical obstruction).        How would you proceed with this patient?          Always look at the ABCs:                  Airway → is it open? Is air going in or out? Is there stridor/wheezing? Is the child crying (then their airway is probably okay).          Breathing → listen to their lungs, breath sounds, count the respiratory rate, look for accessory muscle use.          Circulation → BP, HR, pulses, listen to the heart, capillary refill, patient colour (cyanosed? red?), temperature (warm vs. cold and clammy).                    Approach:                  Airway → put the patient supine, perform a jaw tilt to open up the airway (can’t do this if there’s a C-spine injury). Intubation if the airway is compromised.          Breathing → mask, oxygen.          Circulation → isotonic fluids.                      Why is the airway of the infant and young child more easily compromised than in an adult?          Infants have a narrowing of their vocal cords below the level of the glottis.      Their tracheal cartilage is also softer than that of adults.      Soft tissue wise, children also have large lymphoid tissue, and less soft tissue tone.      Hence, their airway is more susceptible to compromise.      With respect to neonates, they are obligate nose-breathers (in order to be able to breathe while breast-feeding); this means that if they can’t breathe through the nose, they can’t breathe at all!        Why is important to use isotonic crystalloids for fluid resuscitation?          You don’t want oncotic flow in or out of the blood vessels.      With possible sepsis, their blood vessels are probably already leaky and vasodilated, so this would be a bad idea.        What lab investigations should you order?          Blood gases.      CBC; assess Hb and WBCs (signs of infection).      Electrolytes.      Creatinine, BUN (to look for signs of dehydration).        Blood Gases      Nadia’s blood gases are as follows:              PaCO2 65 mmHg (N = 40)        PaO2 45 mmHg        HCO3 24 (N = 24)        pH 7.20        SaO2 80%               How would you describe Nadia’s ventilatory status? How would you manage this?          The patient is acidotic (N = 7.4).      Their PaCO2 is elevated (N = 40), hence there is a primary respiratory acidosis.      There’s a rise in 25 of the PaCO2, and there’s a negligible drop in the bicarbonate (N = 24), so this is likely an acute respiratory acidosis.      Her PaO2 and SaO2 are low; she’s poorly oxygenated.      Since she’s breathing quickly, but her PaCO2 is rising, you’re worried that she’s decompensating.      Acutely, give her oxygen!        Nadia begins to exhibit pauses in her breathing of up to 5 seconds, and her respiratory rate drops to 20/min. How would you manage this?          Increase oxygen; bag-mask ventilation with 100% O2.      Consider intubation.        When is endotracheal intubation indicated?          Compromised airway.      Respiratory fatigue (apnea) and an inability to increase sats with bag mask ventilation.      Coma, low GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale).      Cardiac arrest.        Additional Information  You provide 100% oxygen and then intubate Nadia. A fluid bolus of 200 cc of NS (20 cc/kg) is given and her status begins to stabilize. HR decreases. Oxygen saturation is now 98% on 100% oxygen.  What is next in your management strategy?          Treat the underlying cause of the respiratory distress.        What are common causes of respiratory failure in children?          Hypovolemic or distributive causes are most common.      Examples include bronchiolitis (often caused by respiratory syncytial virus), asthma, pneumonia, upper airway obstruction, and sepsis/ARDS.        Based on the history and physical findings from Nadia’s initial presentation, what do you think is the potential cause for her respiratory failure?          Bronchiolitis → previous infection with clear discharge (suggestive of a viral infection).      Asthma would also be on the differential (another lower airway problem).        What is the most common complication of respiratory failure in children?          Cardiac arrest is the most serious complication.        Discuss the incidence of cardiac and respiratory arrest in adults and children.          Adults get cardiac arrest due to a cardiac problem.      Children get cardiac arrest due to a respiratory problem.        What caused Nadia’s disorder?          Bronchiolitis; inflammation of the small airways (bronchioles) of the lower respiratory tract.      Commonly caused by a viral infection by respiratory syncytial virus.        How is it treated?          Supportive treatment, treat the symptoms.      Replenish fluids (IVs) and nutrition (NG feeds).      Admit if condition deteriorates, apnea, or cardiac arrest.        Additional Information  Over the next 7 days Nadia’s condition improves substantially. She is extubated on day 3 and she is discharged home on day 7. She is doing well and has had no recurrent episodes.  What follow-up would you advise?          Come back if her symptoms arise again, or if she has difficulties feeding.      Follow-up with physician later.      Education; bronchiolitis occurs less frequently as you age.

Identify the behavioural skills required to monitor the emotional effect of critical incidents on personal and professional life.      Initial Assessment  Always start with the ABC’s; it’s in the order of urgency!          A closed airway will kill you before impaired breathing, which will kill you before circulatory compromise.        Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT):          Provides you with clues as to what’s abnormal.      The 3 parts of the PAT are:                  Appearance.          Breathing.           Circulation.

Important Physiologic Differences.Children don’t get hypotension, unless they’re about to die.In children, they can’t effectively raise stroke volume, so they increase CO by increasing HR.

Be focused and think of ‘what’.          Imagine you could only check 2 things, and DO THEM well!      Don’t just regurgitate your P/E approach.        Come up with a plan          Pretend as if the consultant doesn’t exist.      You learn so much more if you try to come up with investigations and a plan.        Don’t cop out.          You only have a few times to acquire a certain skill.      Once you become a senior resident, no one double-checks!      Don’t do “I don’t want to look because I don’t want to put the patient through this”.      Do everything!        Put the patient first.          Stay if it helps; don’t just ditch when you can!        Do a little bit every day!          Don’t just leave everything till the last minute!      Some people start off amazing and end up being disappointing; others are the opposite!      Just do a little bit every day!        Find role-models.          Aspire to be like them!

	{"title": "Shock", "text": "Shock“Shock is a momentary pause in the act of death”High mortality rate.Septic shock 30-40% mortality rate, even with optimal therapy.  Definition → a failure of tissue perfusion.  Recall definition of oxygen delivery.  CO x O2 content.      HR x SV x [Hb X O2 sat + 0.003 x PO2].    Recognizing shock: “The patient in shock has the appearance of being seriously ill.”          ie, they look ‘super sick’.      Younger patients often have stronger compensatory mechanisms; but when these mechanisms fail, they will crash more heavily.        Metabolic acidosis due to anaerobic lactic acid metabolism.          Lactate is a measure of how well we resuscitate a patient.      Classification of Shock  Shock can be classified as follows:          Hypovolemic      Cargiogenic      Obstructive      Distributive → ie. Septic shock.      1. Hypovolemic Shock  Due to a loss of fluid or blood.  For instance, external hemorrhage or fluid loss.  This can be easily seen (such as an overt hemorrhage) or hidden (internal bleeding).  Things that happen in the brain do not make you hypotensive; they’re very well circumscribed.          If anything, they’ll make you hypertensive due to activation of the SNS.      They’ll only be hypotensive if a cranial bleed results in brain death.        Compensatory mechanisms with hypovolemia:          Increased sympathetic activity.                  Increased HR, vasoconstriction.                    Neuroendocrine System                  RAAS activation.          ADH release.                    Transcapillary refill                  As we vasocontrict          Decreased pressure in capillary.          Actually draws fluid into capillary.          Basically try to auto-transfuse ourselves.                    Selective organ perfusion.                  Heart, respiratory muscles, brain, increase perfusion.          Renal blood flow and liver and gut flow decrease.          Not important in acute shock situations.                      Decompensation in Shock:          Arteriolar vasodilation → due to surrounding acidosis.      Anaerobic metabolism.      Cellular ischemia.      Transcapillary flux → loss of blood volume back into interstitium due to loss of compensatory mechanism.        Can’t acutely trust the Hemoglobin.  Blood pressure looks low.  Called to see Pt. who has just vomited a ‘large’ amount of blood.  Vitals: HR 72, BP 90/60, RR 12.  Shock!?  Take bloodwork, Hb 103 (was 106).      Careful with beta-blockers with normal looking HR.    Same patient: HR 134.  BP 90/60.  Hb 104 from 106.Why can’t you trust the hemoglobin?While you’re losing RBCs, you’re also losing plasma!The reason your Hb falls is with transcapillary refill diluting the blood!This doesn’t happen in the short term, so acute measurements of Hb may be inaccurate!Hypovolemic shock:CommonAssume until proven otherwiseTx:- Fluids → isotonic (RL or NS), NOT dextrose containing (will result in hyperglycemia).- Blood products.- Colloid → 5% albumin, NOT pentastarch.- What about dilution of Hb or clotting factors?	- Must simultaneously transfuse FFP and platelets!	- To avoid the ‘vicious circle’How much fluid is enough?- Use clinical exam.- Give fluid until they don’t look like crap.- HR, BP, U/O, peripheral perfusion, mentation.1. Cardiogenic Shock  Similar compensatory mechanisms as with hypovolemic shock.Bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.
