General approach:          Assess the ABCs.      Resuscitate.      Ascertain what ingestion or exposure has occurred → try to find out what toxidrome is involved.      Decontaminate/eliminate.      Antidote.        Risk Factors with the ABCs:          Airway → toxic risk factors include:                  Ingestion of corrosives (highly acidic or basic).          Inhalation of toxic substances.          Drugs causing CNS depression.          COMA → if the patient is comatose, remember DON’T for treatment: dextrose, oxygen, narcan and thiamine.          This is known as the COMA cocktail; a series of drugs that have minimal harm, and can be given to the undifferentiated coma patient.                    Breathing → immediate threats to breathing are:  You can see respiratory fatigue as a rise in the PCO2 even when the bicarbonate is low.                  Metabolic acidosis causing hyperventilation (compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This is a threat because it causes respiratory fatigue over time, depending on the degree of acidosis.          Hypoventilation → respiratory depression.          CNS depression or excitation.          CVS depression → cardiac failure.                    Circulation → immediate threats to circulation are:                  HR, BP.          QT prolongation → risk of Torsades.          QRS prolongation → VT or PEA arrest (PEA = pulseless electrical activity).                      DON’T Mnemonic      DON’T → Dextrose, oxygen, narcan, thiamine.    These have minimal harm, and potential gain (eg. even if the patient wasn’t hypoglycemic, giving them dextrose won’t hurt).    What should you ask on history?          Interview the patient, friends, family, police and/or paramedics.      AMPLE History → Allergies, Medications, PMHx, Last meal, Events (surrounding the presentation, ie. HPI).                  Rather than a full history, here, we only focus on the emergent issues.                    Figure out the W’s → who, what, when, where, why, how much?      Co-ingestants? Emesis?      Call POISON CENTRE for information and management advice.        What should you look for on Physical Exam?          Airway → if not patent, intubate early!      Breathing → look for hypoventilation or hyperventilation:                  Hypoventilation (mostly sedatives) → ethanol, sedative hypnotics, carbon monoxide, cyanide, opiates.          Hyperventilation → amphetamines, salicylates, cocaine, drug withdrawal.                    Circulation → brady/tachycardia, hyper/hypotension.  Generally intuitive; things that activate the SNS or inhibit the PSNS have excitatory effects, and vice versa.                  Bradycardia → beta-blockers, CCBs, digoxin, mushrooms.          Tachycardia → anticholinergics (look like symphathomimetics, but with NO SWEATING), amphetamines, antihistamines, cocaine, stimulants, drug withdrawal.  Note that TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants) are listed as both hypotensive and hypertensive drugs; this is because they have &gt; 1 mechanism of action.          Hypotension → antihypertensives (duh), antipsychotics, TCA, ethanol, AV node blockers, opiates, sedatives.          Hypertension → amphetamines, cocaine, PCP, TCA, sympathomimetics.                    Temperature → hypothermia or hyperthermia.                  Hypothermia → antipsychotics, ethanol, hypoglycemia, opioids, sedative hypnotics.          Hyperthermia → amphetamines, anticholinergics, cocaine, symphathomimetics, withdrawal, antihistamines, TCA.                    Eye Findings:                  Mydriasis (pupil dilation) → anticholinergics, sympathomimetics, Demerol (an older opiate that paradoxically dilates the eyes), withdrawal states.          Miosis → (pupil constriction) → cholinergics, narcotics, phenothiazine (an antipsychotic).          Nystagmus → alcohol, barbituates, dilantin, PCP, carbamazepine.                    Abnormal Odours (don’t need to remember):                  Garlic → arsenic, organophosphate.          Bitter almonds → cyanide, apricot pits.          Rotten eggs → hydrogen sulfide.          Acetone → isopropyl alcohol, ethanol.          Shoe polish → nitrobenzene.          Violets → turpentine.          Pears → chloral hydrate.          Peanuts → vacor.                    Skin bullous lesions → could suggest a bite, caustic chemicals, etc.      The Poison Control Centre  Objective      Explain the role of the Poison Control Centre.    The Poison Control Centre gives you the following information:          Is the drug they took toxic?      Pharmacokinetics                  The drug solubility helps you determine how to eliminate the toxin.                          Water soluble drugs can be eliminated via the urine or through dialysis.              Protein bound drugs have to be out-competed by a competitive agonist.              Lipophilic bound drugs will ‘hide’ in fat stores, and will be more toxic to the CNS.                                The half-life determines how long you have to watch the patient before you can rule out toxicity. This can often vary based on dosage if the drug changes pharmacokinetics (eg. it changes from 1st to zero-order kinetics).                    Decontaminate? Eliminate?      Labs and diagnostics.      Indicated treatments and therapeutic contraindications.      Toxidromes  Objective      Describe and recognize the following toxidromes, and identify at least one drug capable of causing the toxicity:              Anticholinergic.        Cholinergic.        Sympathomimetic.        Opiate.        Sedative/hypnotic.              Here, you take all the findings listed previously on Hx and P/E, and you integrate them.  Put together your assesment of the pulse, BP, respiration, temperature, bowel sounds, skin, mentation, pupils, and start to evaluate if a toxidrome exists.  Toxidrome → a toxidrome is a group of signs and symptoms that tend to consistently result from a particular toxic exposure.          Recognizing the toxidrome aids in the diagnosis and management of the unknown poisoning.      Not all features of a toxidrome are consistently present, and partial presentations do not suggest a less severe disease.      The ‘tox physical’ → vitals, mental status, pupils, GI, skin assessment, muscous membranes, GU.      Anticholinergic Toxidrome  Recall from Cholinergic Pharmacology II back in Cardio, that the features of this were:          Hot as a hare → people are no longer able to sweat, can’t thermoregulate.      Dry as a bone → also because they can’t sweat anymore. Also, since we block salivation (the S in SLUDGE), we have a dry mouth.      Red as a beet → flushing due to systemic vasodilation. (recall that the SNS causes systemic vasoconstriction and skeletal muscle vasodilation)      Blind as a bat → pupil dilation affects the reflex of accomodation.       Mad as a hatter → if the muscarinic antagonist passes the BBB, it can cause CNS effects.        How do you differentiate this from a sympathomimetic toxidrome?          Most of the features (↑ HR, BP) are shared by drugs that stimulate the SNS.      The key difference is the ABSENCE OF SWEATING.      Generally, blocking PSNS (by blocking Ach) gives you similar effects as stimulating the SNS, with one exception → sweating!      With a sympathomimetic toxidrome you have sweating; with an anticholinergic toxidrome you don’t.        Remember      The diference between a sympathomimetic toxidrome and an antimuscarinic toxidrome is the ABSENCE OF SWEATING.    Is ‘antimuscarinic’ the same as ‘anticholinergic’?          Although they’re used interchangeably, technically, antimuscarinic is the more accurate term, since not all acetylcholine receptors are blocked by an anticholinergic toxin.      Recall that there are 2 types of cholinergic receptors:                  Muscarinic.          Nicotinic.                    Anticholinergic toxins competitively block the post-ganglionic muscarinic receptors, but have little/no influence on the pre-ganglionic nicotinic receptors.      See Cholinergic Pharmacology I for review.        What antimuscarinic drugs are there?  Note that atropine, the prototypical anticholinergic drug, is derived from Jimson weed.          Tricyclic Antidepressants.      Antipsychotics.      Antihistamines.      Antiarrhytmics (Quinidine).      Plant alkaloids (Jimson Weed).      Mydriatic ophthalmic drops.      Meperidine.      Carbamazepine.      Cyclobenzaprine.        MEMORY TIP → these are all the anti- drugs: tricyclic anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-histamines, anti-arrhytmics.  Remember      Most antimuscarinic drugs are the anti- drugs:              Tricyclic antidepressants.        Antipsychotics.        Antihistamines.        Antiarrhytmics.              Management:          ABCs as always.      FLUIDS → since everything is ‘turned on’ for these patients.      BENZODIAZEPINES → since everything is turned on, and these people are very agitated, you need to calm them down.                  Benzodiazepines are the safest drug in any toxic patient, so it’s the go-to drug to use if a patient is agitated.          DO NOT GIVE THEM AN ANTIPSYCHOTIC; they’re antimuscarinic, so this could actually worsen their symptoms.                    Call the poison centre.        Antimuscarinic Management      ABCs.    Fluids.    Benzodiazepines.    Call the poison centre.        Clinical Pearl → Benzodiazepines are the safest drug in any toxic patient, so it’s the go-to drug to use if a patient is agitated.

Case #1  Case Summary  Nadia is a 4 month old girl who is brought into the emergency department by her parents with symptoms of lethargy and difficulty breathing. They tell you that Nadia was well until yesterday when she developed symptoms of clear nasal discharge, cough and a low- grade fever. Over the course of yesterday her condition worsened with the development of wheezing, noisy breathing, irritability and poor feeding. Nadia’s parents tell you that she did not sleep well last night due to cough and has vomited her last two feeds. Today she does not seem herself, is less irritable but not very interested in her surroundings and she seems to be breathing faster than normal.   What are important points to get on history?          Make sure the patient is stable; ABCs first.      One useful mnemonic is AMPLE:      A → Allergies.      M → Medications.      P → Past Medical History.      L → Last meal.      E → Events (surrounding the presentation); HPI.        Physical Examination      Upon examination you see an ill looking child with respiratory distress.              HR: 180.        RR: 80.        BP: 70/45.        Temp: 38.1°C.        O2 sat: 83% in room air.              Nadia is now very restless and her parents are unable to settle her. There are intercostal and suprasternal retractions. There are decreased breath sounds with a faint, audible wheeze.     What is the significance of these P/E findings?          O2 sats below 92% → respiratory failure.      Patient is tachycardic, tachypneic, and mildly afebrile.      Patient is using accessory muscles to help breathing.      Wheezing suggests that this is a lower airway problem; pneumonia, asthma.        Why is it particularly important to identify respiratory compromise in infants and children?          In children, respiratory failure can lead to cardiac arrest, unlike in adults (where this is usually a heart-specific problem).      The prognosis for cardiac arrest in children is poor, but it’s quite good for respiratory failure.      So it’s best to treat these children early!        What is the physiologic response to decreased tissue oxygenation in infants and young children? How does this differ from adults?          Unlike adults, children are unable to increase their stroke volume in order to compensate for reduced tissue oxygenation.      Hence, children will only present with tachycardia.      Recall that .      Similarly, although children can increase their respiratory rate, they cannot increase their tidal volume effectively.        Respiratory failure can be hypoxemic or hypercarbic or both. How does this occur?          Hypoxemic → inability to add O2 to the blood, eg. due to V/Q mismatch, or acute filling or collapse of the alveoli.      Hypercarbic → inability to clear CO2 from the alveoli (due to impaired breathing such as with a drug overdose, or mechanical obstruction).        How would you proceed with this patient?          Always look at the ABCs:                  Airway → is it open? Is air going in or out? Is there stridor/wheezing? Is the child crying (then their airway is probably okay).          Breathing → listen to their lungs, breath sounds, count the respiratory rate, look for accessory muscle use.          Circulation → BP, HR, pulses, listen to the heart, capillary refill, patient colour (cyanosed? red?), temperature (warm vs. cold and clammy).                    Approach:                  Airway → put the patient supine, perform a jaw tilt to open up the airway (can’t do this if there’s a C-spine injury). Intubation if the airway is compromised.          Breathing → mask, oxygen.          Circulation → isotonic fluids.                      Why is the airway of the infant and young child more easily compromised than in an adult?          Infants have a narrowing of their vocal cords below the level of the glottis.      Their tracheal cartilage is also softer than that of adults.      Soft tissue wise, children also have large lymphoid tissue, and less soft tissue tone.      Hence, their airway is more susceptible to compromise.      With respect to neonates, they are obligate nose-breathers (in order to be able to breathe while breast-feeding); this means that if they can’t breathe through the nose, they can’t breathe at all!        Why is important to use isotonic crystalloids for fluid resuscitation?          You don’t want oncotic flow in or out of the blood vessels.      With possible sepsis, their blood vessels are probably already leaky and vasodilated, so this would be a bad idea.        What lab investigations should you order?          Blood gases.      CBC; assess Hb and WBCs (signs of infection).      Electrolytes.      Creatinine, BUN (to look for signs of dehydration).        Blood Gases      Nadia’s blood gases are as follows:              PaCO2 65 mmHg (N = 40)        PaO2 45 mmHg        HCO3 24 (N = 24)        pH 7.20        SaO2 80%               How would you describe Nadia’s ventilatory status? How would you manage this?          The patient is acidotic (N = 7.4).      Their PaCO2 is elevated (N = 40), hence there is a primary respiratory acidosis.      There’s a rise in 25 of the PaCO2, and there’s a negligible drop in the bicarbonate (N = 24), so this is likely an acute respiratory acidosis.      Her PaO2 and SaO2 are low; she’s poorly oxygenated.      Since she’s breathing quickly, but her PaCO2 is rising, you’re worried that she’s decompensating.      Acutely, give her oxygen!        Nadia begins to exhibit pauses in her breathing of up to 5 seconds, and her respiratory rate drops to 20/min. How would you manage this?          Increase oxygen; bag-mask ventilation with 100% O2.      Consider intubation.        When is endotracheal intubation indicated?          Compromised airway.      Respiratory fatigue (apnea) and an inability to increase sats with bag mask ventilation.      Coma, low GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale).      Cardiac arrest.        Additional Information  You provide 100% oxygen and then intubate Nadia. A fluid bolus of 200 cc of NS (20 cc/kg) is given and her status begins to stabilize. HR decreases. Oxygen saturation is now 98% on 100% oxygen.  What is next in your management strategy?          Treat the underlying cause of the respiratory distress.        What are common causes of respiratory failure in children?          Hypovolemic or distributive causes are most common.      Examples include bronchiolitis (often caused by respiratory syncytial virus), asthma, pneumonia, upper airway obstruction, and sepsis/ARDS.        Based on the history and physical findings from Nadia’s initial presentation, what do you think is the potential cause for her respiratory failure?          Bronchiolitis → previous infection with clear discharge (suggestive of a viral infection).      Asthma would also be on the differential (another lower airway problem).        What is the most common complication of respiratory failure in children?          Cardiac arrest is the most serious complication.        Discuss the incidence of cardiac and respiratory arrest in adults and children.          Adults get cardiac arrest due to a cardiac problem.      Children get cardiac arrest due to a respiratory problem.        What caused Nadia’s disorder?          Bronchiolitis; inflammation of the small airways (bronchioles) of the lower respiratory tract.      Commonly caused by a viral infection by respiratory syncytial virus.        How is it treated?          Supportive treatment, treat the symptoms.      Replenish fluids (IVs) and nutrition (NG feeds).      Admit if condition deteriorates, apnea, or cardiac arrest.        Additional Information  Over the next 7 days Nadia’s condition improves substantially. She is extubated on day 3 and she is discharged home on day 7. She is doing well and has had no recurrent episodes.  What follow-up would you advise?          Come back if her symptoms arise again, or if she has difficulties feeding.      Follow-up with physician later.      Education; bronchiolitis occurs less frequently as you age.

Identify the behavioural skills required to monitor the emotional effect of critical incidents on personal and professional life.        Objective      Apply the principles of resuscitation to prioritize management and investigations in Paediatric patients utilizing the Paediatric Assessment Triangle.  Initial Assessment  Always start with the ABC’s; it’s in the order of urgency!          A closed airway will kill you before impaired breathing, which will kill you before circulatory compromise.        Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT):          Provides you with clues as to what’s abnormal.      The 3 parts of the PAT are:                  Appearance, rather than airways.          Breathing.           Circulation.                      The idea with the PAT is that, if you look at what’s abnormal, you get a hint at what you’re dealing with, as seen below.            Exampe      Appearance      Breathing      Circulation                  Pneumonia      Normal      Abnormal      Normal              Sepsis      Abnormal      Abnormal      Abnormal              Intoxication      Abnormal      Normal      Normal        Children rarely die; if they do, the most common cause is due to injury (except in infants, where it’s due to congenital problems).  The chart below shows the leading causes of mortality for each age group.Basic Life Support Differences  CPR will be done faster in a child than in an adult.  Rescue breathing:          Adult → RR 12 (1 breath/5 seconds).      Child → RR 16/min.      Infant → RR 20/min.        CPR hand position:          Adults → 2 hand technique (&gt; 5 cm).      Children → 1 hand technique (5 cm).      Infants → 2 finger technique (4 cm).        Objective      Recognize the physiologic differences between pediatrics and adults.  Important Physiologic Differences  Children don’t get hypotension, unless they’re about to die.  In children, they can’t effectively raise stroke volume, so they increase CO by increasing HR.          , so if SV can’t increase, HR has to.        Corrollaries:          HYPOTENSION IS A LATE SIGN OF SHOCK.      TACHYCARDIA IS WORRISOME IN CHILDREN.        The same thing applies with respiration, where children can’t easily change their tidal volume:          , so if the TV can’t increase, then the RR has to.        Broadly speaking, in order to compensate, children just do things faster.  Important      Children cannot effectively change their stroke volume or tidal volume.    So when they have circulatory or respiratory problems, the only way they can compensate is by changing their HR or RR.    Hence TACHYCARDIA or TACHYPNEA are worrisome signs in children.  Appearance/Breathing  Objective      Describe the differences in management of Paediatric patients in relation to:              Equipment choices        Choice of Medications        Intravenous Access            WHAT DO YOU NEED FOR INTUBATION?T - 8 min.  Initial needs for intubation:  – Suction  – Oxygen  – Airway Equipment  – Pharmacology  – Monitoring Equipment  Mnemonic → SOAP MET - 5 min.  Preoxygenation.  Preoxygenate them before the procedure itself (which puts them to sleep and reduces their ventilatory drive).  Prevents the procedure from exacerbating the problem.  Especially important due to decreased pulmonary capacity of the child and the negative effects of hypoxiaT - 2 min.Pre-medications	- Premediate, sedate, paralyze them empirically.	- Drugs that may be useful for the process of intubation.Atropine.	- Protects against reduced vagal tone with paralysis; prevents patient from going bradycardic when you sedate them.	- Dose: 0.02 mg/kg.	- Minimum dose of 0.1 mg/kg.Lidocaine.	- Blunt increased ICP when you manipulate the airway.T - 1 min.Sedate the patient before you intubate them:- It’s humane.- It prevents them from struggling and making it difficult to establish and airway.Sedatives -&gt; Etomidate, fentanyl, morphine, thiopental, ketamine, midazolam.	- Each has +s and -s.Paralytics -&gt; Depolarizing, non-depolarizing.Cricoid pressure.BURP = backwards upwards retrograde pressure.INTUBATE.• Check Tube Placement– Due to short trachea – Rt mainstem bronchus intubations common• Radiograph • Sedation- Make sure air entry is bilateral and equal on both sides to make sure this doesn’t happen.Circulation  Poor Feeding  Lethargy  Irritiability  Decreased LOC  Sunken fontanelle  prolonged capillary refill time   Tachycardia  mottling of the skin  cool extremities  decreased urine outputMost common causes of shock:1. HYPOVOLEMIC = most common.2. DISTRIBUTIVE = most worrisome.	- SEPSIS.Circulating blood volume– 80 cc/kg• For acute fluid resuscitation – Isotonic Solution– Normal Saline– Ringer’s Lactate– Acute bolus of 20cc/kg over 30min-1 hourDifficult IV Access• Common problem in Pediatrics• Often patients transported to CHWOwithout IV access• Frequently multiple attempts required• In resuscitations, often compounded level of difficulty given status of patient- Use of central lines	- Femoral, subclavian, or even jugular vein.• Use of umbilical lines	- If very young infant, within first week or 2, you can still use umbilicus.• Use of different anatomic sites	- Periabdominal, scalp veins, etc. • Use of an Intra-osseous	- In traumatic situations, where you need an IV within 90 seconds, and other things aren’t working.	- Huge ass needle that you stick into a bone, typically anterior tibia. 1-3 cm below tibial tuberosity.	- But into bone marrow, and infuse medications into bone marrow.	- IO-gun = needle attached to screwdriver.	- O__O.  You know it’s in when you feel a lack of resistance after passing through the bony cortex.  If the needle stands up straight w/o support.  The ability to aspirate bone marrow.  The free flow of fluid without s/q infiltration.Contraindications:  Open fracture.  Open wound at insertion site.  Existing increased compartment pressures; worried about compartment syndrome.Complications:• Extravasation of fluids or medications into subcutaneous tissue• Subcutaneous abscess, osteomyelitis, bacteraemia• Epiphyseal injury, Fracture• Fat EmbolusTips for Clerkship  Don’t be a bird (regurgitate everything); think as it comes about what it means.  Be focused and think of ‘what’.          Imagine you could only check 2 things, and DO THEM well!      Don’t just regurgitate your P/E approach.        Come up with a plan          Pretend as if the consultant doesn’t exist.      You learn so much more if you try to come up with investigations and a plan.        Don’t cop out.          You only have a few times to acquire a certain skill.      Once you become a senior resident, no one double-checks!      Don’t do “I don’t want to look because I don’t want to put the patient through this”.      Do everything!        Put the patient first.          Stay if it helps; don’t just ditch when you can!        Do a little bit every day!          Don’t just leave everything till the last minute!      Some people start off amazing and end up being disappointing; others are the opposite!      Just do a little bit every day!        Find role-models.          Aspire to be like them!        Don’t let the work and abuse detract from the fact that you’re doing great things!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/emergency/2015/03/03/principles-pediatric-resuscitation.html"},
	{"title": "Shock", "text": "Shock“Shock is a momentary pause in the act of death”High mortality rate.Septic shock 30-40% mortality rate, even with optimal therapy.  Definition → a failure of tissue perfusion.  Recall definition of oxygen delivery.  CO x O2 content.      HR x SV x [Hb X O2 sat + 0.003 x PO2].    Recognizing shock: “The patient in shock has the appearance of being seriously ill.”          ie, they look ‘super sick’.      Younger patients often have stronger compensatory mechanisms; but when these mechanisms fail, they will crash more heavily.        Metabolic acidosis due to anaerobic lactic acid metabolism.          Lactate is a measure of how well we resuscitate a patient.      Classification of Shock  Shock can be classified as follows:          Hypovolemic      Cargiogenic      Obstructive      Distributive → ie. Septic shock.      1. Hypovolemic Shock  Due to a loss of fluid or blood.  For instance, external hemorrhage or fluid loss.  This can be easily seen (such as an overt hemorrhage) or hidden (internal bleeding).  Things that happen in the brain do not make you hypotensive; they’re very well circumscribed.          If anything, they’ll make you hypertensive due to activation of the SNS.      They’ll only be hypotensive if a cranial bleed results in brain death.        Compensatory mechanisms with hypovolemia:          Increased sympathetic activity.                  Increased HR, vasoconstriction.                    Neuroendocrine System                  RAAS activation.          ADH release.                    Transcapillary refill                  As we vasocontrict          Decreased pressure in capillary.          Actually draws fluid into capillary.          Basically try to auto-transfuse ourselves.                    Selective organ perfusion.                  Heart, respiratory muscles, brain, increase perfusion.          Renal blood flow and liver and gut flow decrease.          Not important in acute shock situations.                      Decompensation in Shock:          Arteriolar vasodilation → due to surrounding acidosis.      Anaerobic metabolism.      Cellular ischemia.      Transcapillary flux → loss of blood volume back into interstitium due to loss of compensatory mechanism.        Can’t acutely trust the Hemoglobin.  Blood pressure looks low.  Called to see Pt. who has just vomited a ‘large’ amount of blood.  Vitals: HR 72, BP 90/60, RR 12.  Shock!?  Take bloodwork, Hb 103 (was 106).      Careful with beta-blockers with normal looking HR.    Same patient: HR 134.  BP 90/60.  Hb 104 from 106.Why can’t you trust the hemoglobin?While you’re losing RBCs, you’re also losing plasma!The reason your Hb falls is with transcapillary refill diluting the blood!This doesn’t happen in the short term, so acute measurements of Hb may be inaccurate!Hypovolemic shock:CommonAssume until proven otherwiseTx:- Fluids → isotonic (RL or NS), NOT dextrose containing (will result in hyperglycemia).- Blood products.- Colloid → 5% albumin, NOT pentastarch.- What about dilution of Hb or clotting factors?	- Must simultaneously transfuse FFP and platelets!	- To avoid the ‘vicious circle’How much fluid is enough?- Use clinical exam.- Give fluid until they don’t look like crap.- HR, BP, U/O, peripheral perfusion, mentation.1. Cardiogenic Shock  Similar compensatory mechanisms as with hypovolemic shock.Bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.

	{"title": "Principles of Resuscitation", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Recognize the need for resuscitation.  Describe the initial assessment and management of:          Airway obstruction      Respiratory distress      Hypotension        Use the principles of resuscitation to prioritize management and investigations.  Identify the behavioural skills required in teamwork during resuscitation.What is Resuscitation?  Physiologic Definition → a process that restores adequate oxygen delivery to the vital end organs.          Inadequate oxygen can either be caused by reduced delivery (heart failure, hypoxia, anemia) or excess consumption (sepsis, high metabolic rate).      4 main organs → brain, heart, kidneys, liver.      These are the most oxygen-dependent organs in our body.        Most oxygen-dependent organs in the body      Brain    Heart    Kidneys    Liver  Oxygen Delivery  Oxygen Delivery Equation:          Recall the equation from Blood:       In other words, the  delivery is the amount of blood pumped out from the heart () times the content of oxygen in that blood.        Cardiac Output = .  Arterial CO2 Content =  bound to hemoglobin plus the dissolved :          Bound = .      Dissolved = .      The bound oxygen comprises the majority of the oxygen in our blood; the dissolved oxygen is very minor.        Oxygen Delivery    Important Values from the Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve:           corresponds to .       corresponds to .        Hence, as we’ve seen before, for arterial partial pressures &gt; 60, the oxygen saturation is on the ‘flat’ part of the curve, so we can tolerate more significant changes in .  On the other hand, once the  falls below 40, we’re on the steep part of the curve, so any change in the partial pressure has significant effects on the  sats.  Remember       corresponds to .     corresponds to .  Approach to Acute Resuscitation  Acute resuscitation differs from the traditional bottom-up approach:          Bottom-up Approach:                  Hx → P/E → DDx → investigations → diagnosis → treatment.          Here, the goal is to answer what does the patient have?.                    Top-down Approach:                   Go to where the attention is needed; we miss tons of information, but we aim to go where help is most critical.           Here, the goal is to answer what does the patient need?.                    Who needs resuscitation?1. Patients with Abnormal Vitals  Patients with abnormal vitals: HR, RR, BP, Temperature, O2 sats, blood glucose (blood glucose is sometimes known as the 6th vital).  KNOW NORMAL VALUES (for the adult).  VITALS ARE VITAL; always make sure they’re there.  Normal Vitals      Normal vitals in an adult are as follows:    HR → 60-100 BPM.              Tachycardia → &gt; 100 BPM.        Bradycardia → &lt; 60 BPM.              RR → 12-20 breaths/min.              Tachypnea → &gt; 20 breaths/min.        Bradypnea → &lt; 12 breaths/min.              Temp → 36-38.5 °C.    BP → 90-140 systolic, 60-90 diastolic.              Hypotension → &lt; 90/60.        Hypertension → &gt; 140/90.              O2 sats → &gt; ~92%.  2. Some Patients with Abnormal ABCs  ABCs → Airway, Breathing, Circulation.          AIRWAYS → assess the 4 P’s:                  Patent → is the airway open with no obstruction?                          Look → blood, secretions, swelling, foreign bodies.              Listen → stridor, dysphonia.                                Protected → is the airway protected from aspiration?                          Worry if the patient has a decreased LOC, or is unable to swallow.                                Problematic → is the patient difficult to intervene with?                          Difficult ventilation or oxygenation (bag-valve mask) → bearded, obese, older, toothless.              Difficult intubation → obesity, ↓ mouth opening &amp; neck mobility, small chin (recall Mallampati scores).                                Predicted Clinical Course → is the patient expected to deteriorate OR requires travel to another hospital?                    BREATHING:                  Ask yourself 2 questions:                          Can they ventilate?              Can they oxygenate?                                Assessment includes what you’d do in any OSCE respiratory exam (cyanosis, changes in LOC, tripod position, accessory muscle use, etc).                    CIRCULATION → 1 question.                  ? Tissue perfusion → links to the Shock lecture tomorrow.                      Assessment of ABCs      Airways → the 4 P’s:              Patency → is the airway open?        Protection → is the airway protected?        Problematic → is the airway easy to intervene with?        Predicted Clinical Course → do you expect the patient to deteriorate or require travel?              Breathing → ask yourself 2 questions:              Can the patient ventilate? → can they get oxygen into their alveoli?        Can the patient oxygenate? → can they get that alveolar oxygen into their blood?              Circulation → ask yourself 1 question:              Is their tissue perfused?            Priorities before ABCsProtection:Protection with personalprotective equipmentProtect yourself, your family, yourfriends and your patientsApplies to all resuscitations – notjust the ones you think arecontagious or messyDecisionShould you even be doing anything?Resuscitation has the ability to reverse prematuredeath. It can also prolong terminal illness, increasediscomfort and consume resources.DNR.Existing DNR (do not resuscitate) orderneeds to be sought before beginning• Without it, resuscitation proceeds• Often hard to sort out in prehospital andemergency settings• DNR ≠ do not treatSo PDABC.One exception to PDABC -&gt; when don’t you assess in this order?IF ABSENT VITAL SIGNS!Then should be PDCAB (spoiler alert for Wednesday).- Start compressions!!!
