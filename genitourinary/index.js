It was thought to be a viral gastroenteritis. She has had a low grade fever for three days. She vomited 6 times on the first day of her illness, and has had several episodes of liquid stools.What else do you want to know in the history?Diet, sick contacts, their intake/hydration status.Has it happened before.Activity level, voiding problems.Signs of infection: cough, runny nose, difficulty breathing, family history.Perinatal screening problems &#8594; pregnancy on time, any problems near the pregnancy?Additional InformationMaria is at your office now because of persistent fever. The vomiting and diarrhea have resolved, but she is breastfeeding less well than usual. Her mother notes that her urine seems to have a &#8220;strong&#8221; odour, and that she is not as playful as usual. She hasn&#8217;t had any known sick contacts. Maria has no cough, URI symptoms or rash. Past history is unremarkable and she is on no medications.How would you characterize Maria&#8217;s symptoms and what diagnoses would you consider?Strong odour urine + fever &#8594; UTI (cystitis, pyelonephritis).No upper respiratory problems doesn&#8217;t completely rule out pneumonia!Could be gastroenteritis &#8594; still has the liquid stools and vomiting.What if it&#8217;s not an infection?Malignancy.Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.Kawasaki&#8217;s.Thyrotoxicosis &#8594; extremely unlikely.What is the difference between cystitis and pyelonephritis and how would you make this distinction?Cystitis = lower urinary tract.Strong smelling urine would be more suggestive of cystitis.Pyelonephritis = upper urinary tract.More systemic symptoms &#8594; fever, vomiting, flank pain.A DMSA scan is a radionucleotide test that measures dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake into the kidney.

	{"title": "Nephrolithiasis", "text": "IntroductionNephrolithiasis = Kidney stones.Kidney stones are common &#8594; 10% of people will have a renal stone during their life.Kidney stones generally aren&#8217;t a fatal disease &#8594; they&#8217;re a nuisance disease.Most common in males from ages 20-45.&#8220;God gave men kidney stones so they&#8217;d know what women go through in childbirth.&#8221;Kidney stones also have a high recurrence rate, and follow the rule of 10:30% recurrence at 3 years.50% recurrence at 5 years.70% recurrence at 7 years.Case #1Case Summary35 year old male presents to Emergency Dept with 4 hour history of severe left loin pain radiating around into his abdomen and down into his groin.Two renal stones passed after similar pain in previous 2 years.What&#8217;s the immediate management?Loin-to-groin pain is suggestive of ureter obstruction.Recall that pain originating from the kidneys is like putting on a pair of shorts (T10-L1).Recall that pain originating from the ureters is loin-to-groin (T12-L2).This is most likely a kidney stone because of his recurrences. But if this wasn&#8217;t the case, what would be on the differential?Pyelonephritis.Causes of back pain, or other MSK factors.What imaging test would you use to confirm your diagnosis?A plain x-ray will show stones a lot of the time, but will miss them if they&#8217;re not calcific.So you&#8217;ll miss a uric-acid kidney stone, for instance.Nowadays, the diagnostic test that would be done is a CT Scan.An U/S is not as good as a CT scan.So if you&#8217;re asked on a test what the definitive imaging procedure to look for a stone in someone with loin pain, it&#8217;s a CT-scan!However, you should still use a renal U/S to look for hydronephrosis &#8594; other possible obstructive causes.RememberA CT-Scan is the definitive imaging technique when looking for a kidney stone.The patient is in pain. What would you give him to relieve it?The patient would often need a narcotic to manage his pain.Typically, this is morphine.You&#8217;ll often also put an IV in as well, because they probably have been vomiting/not eating during this time.Unfortunately renal colic (abdominal pain due to kidney stones), is a typical excuse used by drug seekers.Be careful not to label people, but don&#8217;t be naive!Give people the benefit of the doubt at first, but if the CT-scan is negative, then you should be more suspicious.How would you manage the patient?Management depends on stone size.The majority of patients are managed conservatively, since 70% of paients will pass the stone without intervention.The rate of spontaneous passage depends on the stone location and size.If it&#8217;s &#60;4 mm, then 90% will pass.If it&#8217;s 4-8 mm, then 50% will pass.If it&#8217;s &#62;8 mm, then it&#8217;s unlikely to pass.When would you surgically intervene?If they have severe, unremitting pain.If there&#8217;s an infection (fever, UTI).If the patient has renal failure &#8594; patients will be at higher risk if they have 1 kidney.Social factors &#8594; this is a relative indication, but if their job involves the lives of many other people (pilots, bus drivers), then you&#8217;d like their stones to be dealt with before they work!RememberIndications for surgical intervention with a kidney stone include:Severe, unremitting pain.Fever/UTI.Renal Failure.Social Factors &#8594; if they work in a job involving the safety of others.What factors affect the type of intervention performed?If you decide to intervene, then the location of the kidney stone affects how it can be removed.If it&#8217;s in the lower third of the ureter, it can be accessed via a scope &#8594; ureteroscopy.If it&#8217;s higher up, you may need to use ESWL &#8594; Extra-corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy &#8594; shockwave treatment.Ureteroscopy &#8594; get to the stone with a scope, with a laser or forceps at the tip.Extra-corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy &#8594; fire shockwaves localized to the stone to break it up.RememberIf you decide to intervene, your options are:UreteroscopyExtra-corporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL).What are the pros and cons of Shockwave Lithotripsy?Advantages &#8594; non-invasive, few complications, minimal anesthesia.Disadvantages &#8594; the stone breaks up into fragments, and the fragments have to be passed. So this itself can be painful &#8594; you&#8217;re passing lots of mini-stones! Also, it doesn&#8217;t work all the time.In general, lithotripsy should be used for smaller stones that are higher up in the ureter.Ureteroscopy, which has a higher success rate, should be used for larger stones that are lower down in the ureter.Are there any contraindications for lithotripsy?Absolute Contraindications &#8594; Pregnancy (you don&#8217;t want to trigger labour), uncorrected bleeding disorder, untreated UTI (the patient has to be stable).Relative Contraindications &#8594; distal obstruction &#8594; you can do cystoscopy instead.What are some possible complications with intervention?Lithotripsy:Hematuria is almost always seen.Fragments of the stone may themselves obstruct.UreteroscopyUTI/sepsis.Ureteral perforation or avulsiion.Retained stone fragments.Ureteral stricture.What are renal stones made of?Most renal stones are comprised of calcium oxalate! - Whether you make calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate depends on the pH of the urine. - Acidic urine &#8594; calcium oxalate. - Alkaline urine &#8594; calcium phosphate. - Most of us have an acidic diet, so we&#8217;ll form calcium oxalate stones.Uric acid stones are the next most common, and these are radiolucent &#8594; they can&#8217;t be seen on X-ray.Recall that excess uric acid can be seen with Tumour Lysis Syndrome, and is a cause of nephrotoxic ATN.Struvite Stones (aka. Triple Phosphate / Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate Stones) are much rarer, but are very memorable.Cystine StonesThese are rare, but memorable, because they&#8217;re due to an inherited metabolic abnormality &#8594; cystinuria.This is not cystinosis, which we saw in the pediatric nephrology lecture &#8594; they&#8217;re different diseases!Stone CompositionFrequencyCalcium Oxalate (or phosphate)80%Uric Acid15%Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate (Struvite)4%Cystine1%RememberCalcium oxalate stones are the most common.What dietary factors predispose someone to getting kidney stones?In order of importance:Low fluid intake/urine volume.This is the single biggest predisposing factor!If you don&#8217;t drink many fluids, then you&#8217;re at a higher risk.Low calcium intake is another risk factor.This is completely unintuitive. Calcium oxalate stones have calcium in them, so why would a low intake be more of a risk?Repeated epidemiological studies actually show that this is the case.This is because if you eat more calcium, you actually bind oxalate in the gut, preventing oxalate absorption. And oxalate is actually a bigger determinant of stone deposition.Low K (fruit and vegetable) intake.Not only do fruits and vegetables contain fluid, which helps with a low fluid intake, but potassium also seems to help with renal stones.Many fruits also contain citrate, which inhibits stone formation.High salt intake.High protein intake.RememberThe single biggest predisposing factor to getting kidney stones is a low fluid intake/urine volume.What metabolic factors predispose someone to getting kidney stones?Idiopathic Hypercalciuria &#8594; 40%.Hyperuricosuria &#8594; 10%.Hyperoxaluria &#8594; 10%.Hypocitraturia &#8594; 8%.Primary hyperparathyroidism &#8594; 1%.Nil identified &#8594; 30%.Case 1 &#8594; ContinuedThe stone passes.U/S (nowadays, more often CT) shows 2-3 stones in one kidney and one in the other.What is the role of lithotripsy?Before, we were dealing with an acute situation, with stones in the ureter causing acute renal colic.Now, we&#8217;re dealing with stones in the kidney, that haven&#8217;t caused symptoms yet.In this case, the patient has already passed a stone, but still has more stones still in the kidney.Since the patient has a history of painful kidney stones, you would do a lithotripsy on the remaining stones.What if you found a stone incidentally, in a patient with no history of kidney stones?Would you still perform a prophylactic lithotripsy?In the money-mongering US, you would definitely perform a lithotripsy, but in Canada it&#8217;s more controversial &#8594; we&#8217;re still not completely sure if it&#8217;s medically indicated.This is often a matter of physician and patient choice.What medical strategies are there for investigation and prevention?Repeated lithotripsies can cause nephron damage, and hypertension.So in a patient with repeated kidney stones, a prevention strategy is important.Should you wait for a patient to get more than one stone?On one hand, kidney stones are pretty common &#8594; recall that 10% of people will will get one in their lifetime.On the other hand, recurrence risks are high, so it might be better to prevent things early.This is a judgement call.Oftentimes, this involves dietary changes (more fluids, more calcium, more fruits and vegetables, less salt and protein), without further investigations for systemic causes.If the patient begins getting recurrent stones, even with dietary changes, then this will warrant additional investigations.How do you investigate recurrent stones?Identify the type of stone:If you can get the stone &#8594; analyze it &#8594; calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, cystine.If you can&#8217;t provide the stone, then you can try urinalysis &#8594; crystals in the urine will often match the stone.If it was opaque or lucent on the KUB (kidneys, ureters, bladder) X-Ray:Opaque &#8594; suggestive of a calcific stone or struvite.Lucent &#8594; suggestive of a uric acid stone or cystine.Spot Urine:Urinalysis as before.Urine pH will help differentiate between calcium oxalate crystals (acidic) and calcium phosphate crystals (alkaline).Urine specific gravity will tell you how concentrated the urine is, which is a risk factor.Bacteria &#8594; struvite stones often are concomitant with an infection.Blood Tests:Calcium &#38; PTH &#8594; high calcium suggestive of a hyperparathyroidism etiology (rare).Uric AcidBicarbonate &#8594; acidotic patients are predisposed to stones because they have low citrate in their urine.24-hour urine collection x 2-3 collections.Volume is useful in assessing how much you&#8217;re drinking. Recall that we have 500 mL of insensible losses a day. So in patients without renal failure, if you&#8217;re peeing 1.4 litres, you&#8217;re probably drinking 1.9 litres.Creatinine can help you determine whether it&#8217;s a complete collection or not. Urine volume will vary depending on fluid intake, but creatinine is pretty predictable depending on height and muscle mass (assuming kidney function is normal).Calcium, oxalate, urate.Citrate &#8594; citrate is a stone inhibitor, so low citrate would be worrisome.Sodium &#8594; measure of salt intake.Potassium &#8594; measure of fruit and vegetable intake.Urea &#8594; measure of protein intake.Imaging &#8594; look for other stones in the kidney.KUB X-ray (Kidneys, ureters, bladder).CT kidneys.RememberCalcium, uric acid, bicarbonate, and PTH are things you should assess in a blood test when looking for kidney stones.If hyperoxaluric – low oxalate diet and raise calcium intake to reduce oxalate absorptionSpinach, kale, chocolate, teas etc. have lots of oxalate.Also raise calcium levels to reduce gut oxalate absorption.If hyperuricosuric - low purine diet +/- allopurinolIf hypocitraturic - potassium citrateOften patients with metabolic acidosis.If hypercalciuric and unresponsive to diet changes, try thiazide diuretic to reduce urine calcium or potassium citrate.You want to keep their body calcium up.Thiazide diuretics cause calcium sparing!Recall that they affect the Na-Cl symporter.Case 1 &#8594; Alternative ScenarioMight be on the exam!Serum calcium comes back at 2.95 (Normal 2.2 - 2.6)Stones are mainly calcium phosphate.What is differential diagnosis for hypercalcemia?Hyperparathyroidism &#8594; often will not only cause (1) hypercalcemia, but also (2) an elevated urine pH (which explains the calcium phosphate stones).Since this patient has calcium phosphate stones, and hypercalcemia, this is highest on the differential.A calcium phosphate stone is shown to the right.Malignancy (including Myeloma)Vitamin D +/- Calcium Intake.Sarcoidosis.Thiazides &#8594; result in calcium sparing, but usually don&#8217;t cause renal stones, because they reduce urinary calcium! They&#8217;re actually often used as prophylaxis against calcific stones.So in this case, where the patient has a stone, it&#8217;s probably not a thiazide diuretic.How do you narrow the differential?Serum PTH &#8594; should be high with hyperparathyroidism, and low with everything else (since it should be inhibitited with high calcium).Non-PTH causes have to distinguished by history and tests.Hyperparathyroidism can also affect bones (recall Osteitis Fibrosis Cystica), cause abdominal pain, and depression:There&#8217;s a rhyme for this &#8594; &#8220;Abdominal groans, mental moans, breaking bones, renal stones&#8221;.How would management change?Remove the cause if possible &#8594; parathyroidectomy if it&#8217;s a hyperparathyroid.IV saline and furosemide.Recall that loop-diuretics have the opposite effect as thiazides &#8594; they result in calcium wasting.IV saline is given to counteract the fluid loss from the diuretic.Bisphosphonates (pamidronate) to protect the bones.RememberLoop Diuretics cause calcium wasting. Treatment for hypercalcemia.Thiazide Diuretics cause calcium sparing. Cause of hypercalemia.Case #2Case Summary42 year old female presents with fever, right loin pain, nausea and vomiting.Diagnosed as pyelonephritis and treated with iv fluids and antibiotics.Urine culture grows proteus.Renal ultrasound shows right staghorn calculus.Urologic management&#8230;Less common than they used to be, because they&#8217;re related to chronic UTIs.Huge thing, lithotripsy will do nothing!Will need to operate on the kidney itself.Magnesium ammonium calcium phosphate (&#8216;triple&#8217; phosphate) &#8594; struvite.Urease producing organisms in urine breaks down urea leading to ammonia in the urine leads to high pH leads to precipitation of phosphate, calcium, ammonium, magnesium.Often predisposed to by structural abnormalities which predispose to obstruction, stasis and infection.Others are predisposed to by same metabolic factors as for calcium oxalate stones – hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria etcEradication of infection requires removal of stone mass - surgery.Then, high fluid intake, salt and protein restriction and antibiotics to prevent recurrence.STRUVITE stones related to CHRONIC INFECTION.UREASE-PRODUCING ORGANISMS.Huge stones can cause PERMANENT KIDNEY FAILURE!GOTTA GET SURGERY TO REMOVE THE INFECTED STONE.Case #3Case Summary40 year old male with 10 episodes of renal calculi in 12 months.Urine shows pH 4.5, uric acid crystals; stone analysis confirms uric acid calculi.Low urine pH.Uric acid crystals in urine.Stone analysis shows uric acid calculi (radiolucent).20% have hyperuricosuria +/- hyperuricemia.80% do not have hyperuricosuria, but the uric acid stones are due to low urine pH and this promotes uric acid precipitation even at normal urine urate levels.Acidic urine shifts equilibrium between uric acid and urate to more urate, causing precipitation.SO THIS IS OFTEN A PH PROBLEM AND NOT A URIC ACID PROBLEM.TREATMENT INVOLVES ALKALINIZING THEIR URINE.Potassium citrate &#8594; both prevents stone formation AND is an alkalinizing agent! Ideal.Sodium bicarbonate &#8594; don&#8217;t like doing this because sodium is also a risk factor for stone precipitation.Acetazolamide &#8594; carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, prevents bicarbonate re-absorption in proximal convoluted tubule, makes urine more basic.Low purine diet +/- allopurinol if hyperuricosuric. This is rare, so focus on the urine pH!Medical management is very effective at dissolving existing stones and preventing new ones.Increase their fluid intake too.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/05/07/nephrolithiasis.html"},

Abdominal may not be.ECTOPIC Wrong location! eg. Femoral triangle.Ectopic testes in the femoral triangle.UDT, Ectopic -&gt; Sx. Retractile, no Tx.Use both hands to gently move the testes down. Make sure they&#8217;ll be calm, otherwise they&#8217;ll present as retractile? If you let go, and it stays there, it&#8217;s retractile. If not, and it moves back up??Female with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Phenotypically seems like a male that will not have palpable testes. Salt wasting crisis, hyperkalemia, etc, dangerous.Bilateral non palpable UDT Bilateral nonpalpable testes in a phenotypic male may be a female with congenital adrenal hyperplasiaCan be life-threatening situation due to salt wasting.Next steps:.Karyotype: ensure XY.MIS (Mullerian inhibiting substance).HCG stimulation test to look for Testosterone rise and confirm presence .of testesLook for MIS &#8594; no testicular tissue, no MIS in blood! (recall, produced by Sertoli cells).Can be girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.Can by boy with bilateral undescended testes.Paternity rates are used as a proxy for fertility rates. (Since 100% of people having children are fertile).Seems to show that no affect with unilateral, but yes with bilateral. Paternity rates compromised in men with previous bilateral, but not unilateral UDT  Up to 90% paternity rates in men with unilateral undescended testis vs. 33-65% with bilateral undescended testesUDT increases risk of testicular cancer. Increases the longer you wait. Even when you fix it, they still have an elevated risk over baseline. Risk persists through life. There was a thought that the contralateral, undescended testicle would also have a higher risk&#8230; but studies show that this isn&#8217;t true.Consequences of UDT: Neoplasia  Testis tumors usually will develop after puberty  RR 3-6 times greater  Orchiopexy lessens the risk of neoplasia and allows surveillance  Greater risk of malignancy with higher position of the testis and delayed orchiopexy  Seminoma is the most common tumor with a UDT.CONSEQUENCES OF A UDT.  Hernia &#62;90 % have a patent processus vaginalis  TesticulartorsioDO SURGERY BETWEEN 6-12 months of age. Don&#8217;t do early because it could still spontaneously descend. Don&#8217;t to it later because you want to avoid risk of infertility or testicular neoplasm. Surgery between 6-12 months of age  Examine under anesthesia to confirm position  Limited to no role of preoperative imaging for UDT even if not palpable. CT Scan, Ultrasound (poor sensitivity, specificity) may show if absent. Most of the time, we do almost no imaging for an UDT. Found by palpation!?INSTEAD DO A DIAGNOSTIC LAPAROSCOPY TO FIND IT. Why is laparoscopy good? You can treat it at the same time. Diagnostic laparoscopy is the procedure of choice for assessment of a nonpalpable testis If needed, diagnostic laparoscopy can naturally transition to therapeutic orchidopexy or orchidectomyGo throuhg the groin. Hernia there too&#8230; patent processus vaginalis. Ligate it at ring.L -&gt; internal ring looks closed, Vanishing Testis.Complications of Orchidopexy  Post-operative testicular ascent  Hematoma formation  Ilioinguinal nerve injury - not too important, parts of sensation to scrotum and groin.  Post-operative torsion - TESTICULAR TORSION.  Damage to vas deferens - IDENTIFY THIS (remember the bridge over troubled water).  Testicular atrophyBIG ONE IS TESTICULAR ATROPHY. The risk of that is much lower with an inguinal one (lower one) vs. a higher one. The farther you move it, the higher the risk. If you don&#8217;t properly affix it to the scrotal tissue, risk of assent afterwards.Disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD) Suspect if:  B/L impalpable testes in phenotypic male  Micropenis  U/L UDT with hypospadiasForeskin ProblemsPrepuTial conditions  BALANO-POSTHITIS foreskin inflammation = posthitis. BALANO = glans too. Can&#8217;t retract foreskin cuz scarred = phimosis. Foreskin forced down (eg with phimosis), causing circulatory obstruction.PHYSIOLOGICAL PHIMOSIS Normal infant foreskin is adherent to glans: physiological phimosis True phimosis = scarring of foreskin. Physiological phimosis = normal. Tx only if true phimosis OR repeated infections / UTI  90% of foreskins are retractible by 3 y  Persistent physiological phimosis in 8% (6-7y), decreasing to 1% by 16 yReassurance, Reassurance, Reassurance!LISTEN TO THIS LECTURE. True phimosis is different because you can see the scar. Thick, can see the scarring. One requires operation, other doesn&#8217;t. Recurrent true balanitis  Beyond 6-7 y of age IF child cooperative Treat child and NOT the parent! Circumcision if repeated true infection. Topical Triamcinolone (0.1%) or Betamethasone (0.1%)  BID-TID application for 6-8 weeks  Gentle retraction after about a week of application  Keep it going after retraction Steroid cream makes the skin more thin and pliable. Allow retraction over time. Once you get it open, gently over time. Overall success of 75-90% with steroid and retraction  Retreat recurrences with same regimen  Physiological phimosis rarely requires a circumcision High index of suspicion: Up to 40% of true phimosis  Circumcision  Can involve meatus or urethraRECOGNIZE BXO (Genital Lichen Sclerosis). Balanitis xerotica obliterans INFLAMMATORY PROCESS. STOP IT QUICK? Looks like a phimosis, but there will be more scarring and inflammation. Palpate top, will feel like a thick scar.

Usually procedure is done by fam doc, ped, obs, in community. How well do these neonates get anesthesia, etc? In community, neonatal community, may get inefficient analgesia/anesthesia.BENEFITS OF NEONATAL CIRCUMCISION  Decreased risk of UTI in infants: Risk decreased 3-7 times NNT: 111 circumcisions to prevent 1 UTI  Decreased risk of cancer: Phimosis is a risk factor  Decreased risk of HIV/STI &#8594; most data from 3 very good RCTs, but in Africa, where HIV incidence much higher.  Potential confounders in interpreting the above factorsNeonatal Circumcision: Risks Complications 0.2-3% Bleeding Infection Glans injury Loss of excessive shaft skin/ Entrapped penis Meatal stenosisNEW POLICIES: should we decide whether to do neonatal circumcision or not?

	{"title": "Case of the Week &ndash; Kidney Transplantation", "text": "Patient CaseThe patient likely had an X-linked recessive disease &#8594; women tended to be the carriers, and the males tended to get it.Patient had slow damage to his glomeruli over time, caused by a genetic diseases &#8594; he likely had Alport Syndrome.Alport Syndrome is a genetic disease where you have a mutation in type-4 collagen.Type-4 collagen is an important part of the glomerular basement membrane, so abnormalities can exacerbate glomerular damage.Type-4 collagen is also involved with other systems &#8594; for instance hearing loss due to ear involvement.Exam MaterialThe following stuff will be on the final exam!Why even do a kidney transplant? What advantages does a kidney transplant have over dialysis?Improved quality of life &#8594; dialysis is miserable.Mortality benefit &#8594; patients who get a transplant live longer than those on dialysis, since dialysis promotes vascular disease.Who is eligible for a kidney transplant?It used to be that you had to be on dialysis to be eligible for a kidney transplant.But this is no longer the case &#8594; now we actually try to give a kidney transplant before the patient needs dialysis. This is called a pre-emptive kidney transplant.Pre-emptive kidney transplants are associated with better outcomes!This isn&#8217;t something that we do as often as a transplant for a patient on dialysis, but it is approved, and it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re trying to do more and more.The most convenient way to do a pre-emptive kidney transplant is with a living donor &#8594; this does not have to be a family member.We don&#8217;t approve of financial-enticement for kidney transplanation.What is the definition of death when you&#8217;re donating an organ?Brain death &#8594; not cardiac death.We do take organs from patients with cardiac death too, but this must be done rapidly, before the organs are no longer viable.As a result, most organ donors are from brain death!Deceased donor kidney transplants do not work as well as living donor kidney transplants.Deceased donor transplants last 8-12 years.Living donor transplants last 15-20 years.Why is this the case?Cold-ischemic time &#8594; with a living kidney donor, since it&#8217;s planned in advance, often the transplant can occur instantaneously.This minimizes the cold-ischemic time.With a deceased donor-transplant, you have to put the organ on ice, wait for the cross-match result, wait to get the operation set up, and then perform the operation.During this time, some degree of necrosis occurs!The longer the cold-ischemic time, the worse the kidney function, and the shorter the graft survival is.Co-morbidities &#8594; often, deceased donors will have other co-morbidities that worsen the viability of their donated kidney.Where is the kidney implanted?Anterior abdominal cavity &#8594; it&#8217;s actually transplanted extra-retro-peritoneally!The renal artery is hooked up to the external iliac artery.The renal vein is hooked up to the external iliac vein.The ureter is hooked up to the bladder.Why is it implanted in the abdominal cavity?It&#8217;s easier to biopsy when you&#8217;re monitoring for rejection.You actually leave the native kidney in there &#8594; you don&#8217;t take it out! They eventually atrophy on their own.Lecture ObjectivesUnderstand the high morbidity and mortality associated with hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and how renal transplantation affects this.Have an approach to understanding the basic immunology of rejection.List the mechanism of action of the immunosuppressive agents.Immunology ReviewImmune System:Innate Immunity &#8594; rapid response to invasion.Acquired Immunity &#8594; later mechanism involving memory B-cells (antibody production).First Lines of Defense:Skin and mucous membranes.Secretion from sweat and sebaceous glands.Tears.Immune cells arise from hematopoiesis in the bone marrow.They communicate via surface molecules and cytokines.With transplantation, the immune response arises from cells of lymphoid origin:T-Cells &#8594; most common. Acute Cellular Rejection.B-Cells &#8594; less common. Antibody-mediated Rejection.RememberT-Cells are involved in Acute Cellular Rejection, which is the most common.B-Cells are involved in Antibody-mediated Rejection, which is more difficult to deal with.Recall that:B-cells produce antibodies.T-cells see foreign antigens expressed on APCs, and become activated and directly attack pathogens.Case StudyCase Summary: Mr. Mini Mintoo32 year old Canadian gentleman of East Indian Background.ESRD from chronic obstructive nephropathy.On hemodialysis for the last 2 years.Otherwise no significant medical problems.Called to Transplant Unit for a deceased donor renal transplant.No blood transfusions, previous transplants.Panel reactive antibodies (PRA) 0%.Donor and recipient are CMV and EBV IgG negative.We will see that this means that the patient is very low risk!QuestionsWhy is having no blood transfusions, previous transplants, or pregnancies (in women) important?It&#8217;s less likely that the patient will have developed antibodies.Recall that we have HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) antigens on all our cell surfaces, which are used to identify self from non-self.Recall that Class I MHC (HLA) was on all nucleated cells.Recall that Class II MHC (HLA) were on APCs only.If you form antibodies against foreign HLAs, then you&#8217;ll develop antibody-mediated rejection, as mentioned before.This is much more difficult to treat than T-cel mediated rejection.How do you detect antibodies against a donor HLA?You want to see if there&#8217;s a reaction between the recipient antibodies and the donor HLAsLymphocytes express both HLA I &amp; II, so you&#8217;d isolate the donor lymphocytes.The antibodies are in the plasma, so you&#8217;d extract the recipient plasma.So we mix donor lymphocytes with recipient plasma, and add a dye + complement to look for a WBC destruction.This is called cross-matching.A positive cross-match is an absolute contraindication for a kidney transplant!RememberA positive cross-match (antibodies against the donor HLA) is an absolute contraindication for a kidney transplant!What are Panel Reactive Antibodies?They&#8217;re an assessment of immunologic risk, that can be regularly done without a potential donor.We take a blood sample from 15 volunteers to act as theoretical donors, which will encompass the majority of HLA types.We isolate their white cells, and do a cross-match against the serum of all the patients on the wait-list.If none of the panel is destroyed, then you&#8217;re low risk.RememberThe PRA (Panel Reactive Antibody) screen helps you assess risk, by cross-matching across a sample of theoretical donors.A low PRA score suggests that you&#8217;re low risk!Why do you care that the patient is CMV and EBV IgG negative?The patient will be on immunosupressants, so they&#8217;ll be susceptible to infection if the donor has had a CMV or EBV infection.If the donor has CMV or EBV, since herpesviruses can lie latent in nerves of the body, it can be transplanted to the recipient!Recall that CMV in the immunosuppressed can be very serious!Recall that EBV in the immunosuppressed can transition to lymphoma!We need the blood types of the donor and recipient to be compatible. Why is this the case?We&#8217;re only transplanting the organ, and not the blood. So why do we need the blood type to be the same?The A-antigen or the B-antigen are expressed on the blood vessels of the kidney.So if you do an ABO-incompatible transplant, you&#8217;ll have a hyperacute rejection, causing almost immediate graft-loss, and probable death.RememberTo perform a transplant, you need the blood types to be compatible and you need the cross-match to be negative!Why do we need immunosuppression and what is your immunosuppression of choice?We need immunosuppression to prevent both acute rejection and chronic rejection.Note that if we have identical twins, then we don&#8217;t need to use immunosuppression &#8594; the body will recognize the organ as self!These kidneys will last until the patient dies, unless they get a recurrence of their original disease.What is the most common cause of acute rejection?The most common cause of acute rejection is T-Cell mediated rejection.Immunosuppression Post-transplantationGraft survival post-transplantation was pretty crappy until the 1980&#8217;s, when cyclosporine was introduced.Cyclosporine revolutionized things!1 year graft survival improved to 80% &#8594; which was a tremendous incrase.Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor (aka CNI).Recall that calcineurin inhibition blocks movement of NFAT through the nuclear membrane, ultimately blocking T-Cell activation.Can&#8217;t activate T-Cells &#8594; no acute T-cell mediated rejection!At present, we have newer calcineurin inhibitors, such as Tacrolimus.Tacrolimus has an even smaller risk of rejection!Mechanism of Action of Calcineurin InhibitorsCalcineurin inhibitors block calcineurin, which is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells).Since calcineurin can no longer dephosphorylate NFAT, NFAT cannot get into the nuclear membrane.This prevents NFAT from upregulating transcription of several key genes for T-cell activation, particularly IL-2, which, as we recall, was critical for T-cell proliferation.The net result is a blocking of T-cell activation.RememberCyclosporine and Tacrolimus are both calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), which block T-cell activation.Tacrolimus is more powerful.Drugs used Post-TransplantationThe typical complement of drugs after transplantation consists of three medications:Calcineurin Inhibitors &#8594; eg. cyclosporine and tacrolimus.PrednisoneMycophenolate (MMF, Cellcept) &#8594; blocks nucleotide synthesis, inhibiting T-cell amplification.This also affects rapid division in other organs, much like we see with chemotherapy for cancer.The two most common side-effects due to this are:Gut Problems &#8594; severe diarrhea, nausea, etc.Bone Marrow Problems &#8594; anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, etc.Patients will be on heavy immunosuppression for the first year, where the risk of rejection is highest.After that, the body begins to acclimate to the new organ, and the risk of rejection falls. At this point, we can begin to lower the dosage of immunosuppression.RememberA patient post-transplantation must be on the following 3 medications:PrednisoneCalcineurin Inhibitor (Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus).Mycophenolate (MMF).All 3 affect the function of T-cells, preventing acute-cellular rejection (the most common type of rejection).Mycophenolate (MMF) can cause GI and BM side-effects.CNI Renal Syndromes of ToxicityIronically, calcineurin inhibitors are nephrotoxic.So even though we need them to avoid rejection, they themselves cause kidney damage!Hence, we have to carefully monitor drug dosage to avoid drug toxicity.Acutely:Like NSAIDs, CNIs vasoconstrict the afferent arteriole, which drops the GFR and triggers a pre-renal state.So if you see a kidney transplant with an elevated creatinine, don&#8217;t immediately suspect rejection &#8594; suspect excess calcineurin inhibitor.With extremely high CNI levels, you can actually get ATN.In extremely rare cases, you can actually get acute microvascular disease (TTP &#8594; Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura).Chronically:CNIs cause scarring, causing a chronic (permanent) progressive decrease in GFR.SirolimusSirolimus, don&#8217;t need to know this.Promising, hoped to replace calcineurin inhibitors.Macrolide (rapamycin, recall mTOR). Other macrolides azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin.Directly inhibits cell-cycle, like mycophenylate.Not nephrotoxic like CNIs.The problem is that this increases the acute rejection rate.Stop using this!Sometimes used in patients long after their transplantation, when their acute rejection risk is low, and the CNI is causing kidney damage.RememberOnly used when acute rejection risk is low, and see nephrotoxicity from CNIs.ATGAM and ThymoglobulinVery powerful antibodies to Tx acute rejection.2 things we do with acute rejection (just like with RPGN):High dose steroids.Powerful antibody to get rid of T-Cells (thymoglobulin).Thymoglobulin, antibodies against human lymphoid tissue, developed in rabbits. The rabbits develop Abs against every human lymphoid marker! Gives you HIV-like CD4 cells.Pretty serious, so thymoglobulin is only used when you have a severe rejection!ATGAMImmunization of horses with human lymphoid materialThymoglobulinImmunization of rabbits with human lymphoid tissueThese polyclonal antibodies contain cytotoxic antibodies against a variety of T cell markersDepletion of peripheral lymphocytesSide effects include fever, chills, arthralgias, anaphylaxis, hematologic toxicity, infection, malignancyMr. Mini MintooFeeling great post transplant, but unfortunately 10 days post transplant develops increase in serum creatinine and renal biopsy confirms mild to moderate rejectionDrug levels are therapeuticWhat are causes of AKI in a patient 10-days post transplant? 1. Calcineurin-inhibitor associated nephrotoxicity. - Recall that CNIs can cause afferent vasoconstriction, leading to a prerenal state. - Since his drug level was therapeutic, this probably isn&#8217;t the case. 2. Acute Rejection:- Could be both cellular or anti-body mediated, but as said before, the T-cell mediated rejection is more common.Approach the kidney transplant patient like any other patient with an AKI!Look for prerenal, renal, or post-renal causes.Prerenal &#8594; volume contraction.Renal &#8594;Post-renal &#8594; U/S with doppler.Recall that we implanted the kidney and reconnected all the vessels to the external iliac artery and vein.Might have abnormal connection.Doppler looks for normal blood flow at these attachment points.This patient has acute rejection.T-cells are the dark purple dots.Some have infiltrated the tubules &#8594; mild rejection.Severe rejection &#8594; also infiltrated the blood vessels.So if only in the interstitium/tubules &#8594; mild rejection.Patient is on Mycophenolate, Prednisone, and Tacrolimus.What&#8217;s our approach? Not severe rejection, so wouldn&#8217;t give thymoglobulin.High-Dose Steroids (Prednisone).Switch to Tacrolimus if on Cyclosporine. (switch to more potent CNI)If already on Tacrolimus, just give high dose prednisone.Mr. Mintoo has a great response to your choice of therapy and his creatinine comes down from a peak of 250 to 140.He is discharged home. Over the next 8 years gradual decline in renal function.Creatinine is now 300 and progressively climbing.Mr. Mintoo undergoes a renal biopsy.Progressive Chronic Kidney Disease.No rejection - don&#8217;t see T-cells or inflammatory cells.Just see scarring.CHRONIC RENAL REJECTION = scarring.Why does this happen? - Immune-independent factors. - Diabetes. - Hypertension. - Drug Toxicity.- Recall chronic CNI Toxicity.Immune-dependent factors.Chronic humoral rejection.Recall that this presents much differently from acute rejection.We have no good Tx for this. Tx good for acute rejection, bad for chronic rejection.The patient has chronic allograft nephropathyNeed to control and manage hypertension and diabetesThe patient is initiated on sirolimus and his tacrolimus is weaned offMr. Mintoo is now maintained on sirolimus, prednisone and MMFOn sirolimus, prednisone and MMF, Mr. Mintoo creatinine settles down at 200 and he is doing wellAdditional InformationWhile on a trip in India, he consumes some samosas that light him on fire.He develops a severe gastroenteritis that lasts 2 weeks and he has been unable to take his immunosuppressive medications.He takes an emergency flight back to London and in clinic his creatinine is 600.He does not respond to volume resuscitation and he receives a renal biopsy.We see severe rejection!Start him on dialysis. Why didn&#8217;t we treat him with thymoglobulin first?He already has crappy kidney, with high creatinine. Odds of restoring kidney function low, odds of killing him with severe immune suppression high, with concomitant infection!What if his creatinine was 80, and he had no scar? And this was an acute case.High dose prednisone.Then you would treat it with thymoglobulin.If could be antibody-mediated rejection (humoral component), then we still give thymoglobulin + prenisone, but we add in PLASMAPHORESIS (remove antibody from blood), and IVIG, which mops up the excess antibodies.If all else fails, we used to consider doing a splenectomy.But now with the introduction of rituximab, anti-CD20 Abs.Targets B-Cells, diminishing anti-donor Abs.Recall we saw this in blood, to treat B-cell Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphomas.What do you need to remember?Transplantation &gt; dialysis.Calcineurin inhibitors are good.Patients will be on 3 immunosuppressant meds: prednisone, CNI, mycophenolate (MMF).Can get transplant without being on dialysis.Living kidney transplants (don&#8217;t have to be related) better than deceased.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/05/02/case-kidney-transplantation.html"},

Ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis and an empty bladder.QuestionsWhat are the likely causes of this presentation? - Obstruction between bladder and kidneys (or in bladder itself) - Tumour because of weight loss and anorexia - Bilateral stones (but rare) - Retroperitoneal fibrosis &#8594; ureters become enclosed and lose peristaltic abilityHow would you manage this case? - Take care of hyperkalemia first - Check EKG first - The do normal hyperkalemia managementDeal with hydronephrosis: use nephrostomy tubes because the bladder is empty (can&#8217;t use Foley catheter)U/S, cystoscopy and maybe CT to visualize the actual obstructionWhat complications might arise during treatment? - Beware post-obstructive diuresis (and subsequent volume depletion, hypokalemia)Posted AnswersTumour - bladder, bowel; bilateral stones; retroperitoneal fibrosis.Nephrostomy tubes, cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography.Post obstructive polyuria leading to volume depletion, hypokalemia, etc.Case 6A 55 year old woman presents with generalized edema (anasarca). On exam, there are pleural effusions, ascities, leg edema ++, and a normal JVP. Urinlaysis shows proteinuria +3, serum creatinine 120 &#956;mol/L, and albumin is 28 g/L. She has been treated with Furosemide 80 mgs daily, but the edema has not responded.QuestionsWhat is the differential diagnosis of generalized edema? - Liver, heart, kidney - Cirrhosis (liver not producing protein) &#8594; decreased oncotic pressure - CHF - Renal failure - Nephrotic syndromeWhat is the mechanism of edema formation here?Low oncotic pressure because of hypoalbuminemiaDecreases effective perfusion pressure, leading to higher urea and creatinine, and sodium retention (this worsens your edema)How would you achieve an effective diuresis?First, you want to make sure he&#8217;s not actually volume contracted (e.g. right-sided heart failure)He&#8217;s got secondary hyperaldoseronism from his hypoalbuminemia - Spironolactone can helpThiazide diuretics also work wellFurosemide in increased doses can helpSalt restrictionYou know you&#8217;ve gone as far as you should go once they start developing orthostatic hypotension (volume contraction becomes evident)What side effects of your suggested treatment need to be considered?Volume contraction, making them pre-renal (constantly evaluate them)Hyperkalemia from spironolactonePosted AnswersCHF, renal failure, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome.This is nephrotic syndrome. The mechanism of the edema is classically thought to be high urinary protein losses leading to hypoalbuminemia, leading to reduce oncotic pressure, leading to intravascular depletion, leading to secondary activation of the hormonal mediators of sodium retention; however, some cases of nephrotic edema also represent a primary failure of sodium excretion by the abnormal kidney.Introduction of additional diuretics, ie potassium sparing or high doses of thiazide-like diuretics eg metolazone. Furosemide can be increased to high doses and given twice daily; sodium restriction can be added; bed rest may also help.Common side-effects of diuretics as listed in the notes; risk of making the patient pre-renal.Case 7A 60 year old woman presents with abdominal pain, distension and vomiting. Blood pressure is 70/40. The surgical team makes a diagnosis of partial small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions. They suggest a conservative approach with no intake by mouth, a nasogastric tube and IV fluids. Blood urea is 20mmol/L (3-6 mmol/L) and creatinine is 120 μmol/L (50-110 μmol/L). Sodium is 130 mmol/L, potassium 3.3, and bicarbonate 28 mmol/L.QuestionsComment on the patient’s volume status. - Volume contractedComment on the urea/creatinine ratio. - Elevated, suggesting volume contraction - Elevated urea/creatinine ratio can also be caused by - Steroids, which make you hypercatabolic - GI bleed: reabsorb blood, which is high in ureaWhat IV fluid regimen would you prescribe immediately?Isotonic replacement because volume depletedIV normal saline + KClWhat would you prescribe the following day, presuming the patient has stabilized but is still partially obstructed?Maintain daily requirement (nutrition) and any ongoing losses (normal is 1.5-2 L for sensible losses)Daily sodium requirement is 150 mmol averageDaily potassium requirement is 60 mmol averageIf the patient received one litre IV of 0.45 saline in 5% dextrose, what proportion of that litre would distribute in the ECF and ICF, respectively? - 666 to the ECF and 333 to the ICF (consider the 1 litre of half normal saline to be 500 ml of normal saline which all goes to the ECF and 500 ml of sodium free fluid which is distributed 1/3 to the ECF and 2/3 to the ICF).Posted AnswersPatient is volume depleted.Urea/creatinine ratio is markedly elevated at &gt; 150:1 (20,000/120); this suggests a very pre-renal state.Intravenous normal saline with added KCl given rapidly until blood pressure risesProvision of daily requirements plus any additional ongoing losses; suggest 2-3. litres of intravenous fluid per day, including 150-200 mmol of sodium chloride and circa 60 mmol of KCl.666 to the ECF and 333 to the ICF (consider the 1 litre of half normal saline to be 500 ml of normal saline which all goes to the ECF and 500 ml of sodium free fluid which is distributed 1/3 to the ECF and 2/3 to the ICF).Case 8A 75 year old male, who lives alone, was found unconscious at home. On exam, there was a dense left hemiplegia (paralysis of arm, leg, trunk on same side of body) consistent with a recent “stroke”, blood pressure was 90/60. Serum sodium was 160 mmol/L.QuestionsHow would you diagnose this patient’s total body Na content, and do you think it is high, low, or normal?Low blood pressure - check orthostatic to confirm volume contractionClinical diagnosisWhat features of this patient’s condition caused him to develop hypernatremia? - The stroke could have caused damage to the thirst mechanism - Most people protect themselves very wellWhy do some volume depleted patients develop hyponatremia and others hypernatremia?If water is available, you drink a lot and you become hyponatremicIf water is not available (either physically or because the patient doesn&#8217;t have the thirst for it), you become hypernatremicPosted AnswersClinical exam; it is low.Hypotonic.Unconsciousness and associated absence of thirst mechanism or inability to access fluid.Depends on availability of water.Case 9A 70 kg man has severe congestive heart failure.

	{"title": "Approach to the Scrotal Mass", "text": "Scrotal AnatomyThe epididymis feeds to the vas deferens, and draws sperm from highly convoluted semniferous tubules.There is a tunica vaginalis on the outside of the testis, and a tunica albuginea just surrounding the testis itself.There is a potential space between the tunica vaginalis and the tunica albuginea!The testes arises from around L1 (recall, this was the transpyloric plane), around where the renal vessels are.The gubernaculum (from gubernatorial &#8594; governing) governs the path that the testicle goes down. It brings with it a layer of tunica vaginalis.On the right, the tunica vaginalis is reflected, revealing the tunica albuginea. The gap between the two is a potential space.Differential Diagnoses for a Scrotal MassBenign or Malignant?Congenital or Acquired?Most people use the VITAMIN-C acronym, or VINDICATE (from rearranging the letters):V &#8594; Vascular.I &#8594; Infectious.T &#8594; Traumatic.A &#8594; Auto-immune.M &#8594; Metabolic.I &#8594; Iatrogenic.N &#8594; Neoplastic.C &#8594; Congenital.The differential diagnosis for a scrotal mass is:Hernia &#8594; protrusion of an organ past a fascial wall.Hydrocele &#8594; fluid-filled sac.Varicocele &#8594; abnormal expansion of the pampiniform venous plexus.Hematocele &#8594; blood-filled sac.Testicular CancerTesticular Torsion &#8594; twisting of the testicles.Epididymitis/Orchitis &#8594; inflammation of the epididymis or testes.HydroceleHydrocele &#8594; fluid-filled scrotal sac.There are two forms of a hydrocele &#8594; one in adults, and one in babies:Babies: Actually a hernia due to incomplete closure, causing the scrotal sac to fill with peritoneal fluid. So this is technically both a hernia and a hydrocele. This is fluid build-up in an open space.Adult: This is fluid build-up in an enclosed space &#8594; typically in the potential space between the tunica vaginalis and the tunica albuginea.In babies, because the hydrocele is due to a hernia, the amount of fluid will vary with abdominal pressure:When the baby cries, the abdominal pressure increases, and fluid will go into the scrotal sac.When the baby is calm, the abdominal pressure falls, and fluid will flow back out of the scrotal sac.Differentiating a Hernia from a HydroceleBoth are spherical bulges in the inguinal/scrotal area.One way of differentiating between them is with trans-illumination &#8594; if you shine a light through the bulge, if it&#8217;s fluid-filled, then it should glow!The problem with this is that many hernias sacs will be fluid-filled too.If it&#8217;s a hernia of the bowel, then you might be able to hear bowel-sounds.The problem with this is that often the hernia may be strangulated, and will convey no bowel sounds.The foolproof differentiating feature is that you cannot get above a hernia but you can with a hydrocele!Since the hydrocele is fluid filled, you can move the fluid around.But with a hernia, you can&#8217;t feel the end, because it&#8217;s a protrusion from another cavity!RememberYou can get above a hydrocele, but you cannot get above a hernia.VaricoceleA varicocele is a dilated network of gonadal veins &#8594; ie. the pampiniform plexus.Often because of back-flow. For instance, this could be due to high abdominal pressure, or defective valves in the gonadal veins.Presentation: - Often asymptomatic, or presents with a dull ache.Infertility is probably due to the increase in scrotal temperature with the improper venous drainage. There are also more blood toxins due to improper clearance.The most common presenting symptom is infertility, or abnormal semen.Physical Exam:Standing Valsava &#8594; the Valsalva maneuver increases the abdominal pressure, so it should exacerbate the varicocele.The scrotum will feel like a bag of worms.Management of a VaricoceleIf they&#8217;re asymptomatic &#8594; leave them alone.If they have infertility, eliminate the soruce of the excessive venous back-flow source by performing a Varicocelectomy:You don&#8217;t just cut out the veins &#8594; instead we ligate the veins that feed the varicocele.A right-sided varicocele is more concerning:This is because the right gonadal vessel feeds directly into the IVC, so if there&#8217;s backflow, it&#8217;s something more serious causing retroperitoneal IVC obstruction (tumours, lymph node enlargement, etc).With a left-sided varicocele, the left gonadal vessel feeds into the left renal vein, which is often compressed by the SMA, so this is a less surprising finding.SpermatoceleSpermatocele &#8594; semen-filled scrotal sac.Originates from seminal fluid leak from the epididymis/rete testis.This can get so big that it&#8217;ll seem like a third testicle!Seldom symptomatic &#8594; will sometimes have pain if it&#8217;s large.These are often difficult to differentiate from a hydrocele because they will also trans-illuminate.However, they won&#8217;t illuminate as well, because semen is murkier.If it&#8217;s bothersome, then a spermatocelectomy should be done.Incision and drainage is not the best way to go, because it&#8217;ll just fill up again.Hematocele/HematomaHematocele &#8594; blood-filled sac.Hematoceles often occupy the potential space between the tunica vaginalis and the tunica albuginea.The key finding on history is a history of direct trauma.May have underlying ruptured testis as well &#8594; rupture of the tunica albuginea.External signs of bleeding, ecchymosis.If it&#8217;s small, you can watch and wait.However, if it&#8217;s continuously enlarging or the testes is ruptured, then you should surgically intervene.Testicular TorsionTesticular Torsion &#8594; caused by a congenital problem with a lack of anchoring of the testis by the gubernaculum.With an insufficient/absent gubernaculum, the testis will lie horizontally, and swing and twist freely.This is often referred to as a bell-clapper deformity.This twisting has numerous consequences:Cutting off of venous blood supply &#8594; this happens first, since the venous system is lower pressure. This causes congestion.Cutting off of arterial blood supply &#8594; this causes ischemia, and evential testicular necrosis!Will present with a sudden onset of severe pain. This differs from the previous conditions we mentioned, which will often have mild/no pain.Generally seen in younger patients (adolescents, young adults).May have had a previous history.Physical Exam:If there&#8217;s congested venous flow only, you&#8217;ll have a rock-hard painful testis, with continued arterial inflow.If there&#8217;s congested arterial flow, then that&#8217;s a surgical emergency &#8594; there&#8217;s no blood flow, so you gotta save the balls!RememberTesticular Torsion is a medical emergency! You have 6-8 hours to save the testicle.Epididymo-orchitisEpididymitis &#8594; inflammation of the epididymis.Orchitis &#8594; inflammation of the testis.This can cause a scrotal mass because the inflammation can cause significant swelling.Usually seen in sexually active patients, or those with obstructive urinary problems.Will often have constitutional symptoms, obviously.Epididymitis and Orchitis will also have pain, similarly to testicular torsion:With epididymo-orchitis, this will usually have a gradual onset.With testicular torsion, this will have an acute onset. Another distinguishing factor with these is increased blood flow.The inflammatory response seen in epididymo-orchitis will result in increased blood flow.This contrasts with testicular torsion, which will result in decreased blood flow.The increased blood flow can be seen via dopper ultrasound, as shown on the right.Differentiating Torsion and EpididymitisTorsionEpididymitisAge GroupAdolescents/Young adultsAdultsOnsetSuddenMore GradualPrevious HistoryMore likely (congenital)Not likelyAssociated S/SNoneS/S of infectionP/EPainful, hard testisPainful, swollen epididymisAlso, note that in testicular torsion, the position of the testicle may differ!It may lie more horizontally.This is often difficult to note with a swollen testis, so you can instead check the contralateral testis.If there&#8217;s a congenital problem with the gubernaculum, you should note the abnormality on the contralateral testis as well!If you&#8217;re still unsure, then you should perform a doppler ultrasound.TorsionEpididymitisBlood Flow (on doppler)NoneIncreasedTreatmentSurgeryAntibioticsIf you still can&#8217;t tell the difference, or you&#8217;re in a rural area where a doppler U/S isn&#8217;t available, then err on the side of caution and proceed with surgical exploration.Testicular CancerPainless enlargement is most common &#8594; archetypically the painless lump.This will often present as a firm lump/nodule.Heavy, aching sensation, but acute pain is only seen in 10% of cases.Lymphatic Spread &#8594; will often spread to L1 lymph nodes &#8594; the embryologic origin of the testes.This is counter-intuitive! Testicular tumours don&#8217;t spread to the nearby lymph nodes, they spread to where their embryological origin is!Spread to the L1 lymph nodes will often result in an abdominal mass.Hematologic Spread &#8594; lungs, liver, brain.Classification of Germ Cell TumoursGerm Cell Tumours can be classified into:SeminomasNon-Seminomas &#8594; teratomas, embryonal cancers, yolk-sac tumours, choriocarcinoma.Epidemiology of Testicular TumoursMost commonly seen in young men &#8594; second to lymphoma as the most common tumour seen in young men.Annual incidence of 3-4% in 100,000.1-2% of all male malignancies.12% of all cancer deaths between ages 20-35.Rare in Asians and Africans, highest in Scandinavia.Etiology of Testicular TumoursCryptorchidism &#8594; undescended testicle.Increases the risk of testicular cancer by up to 40-fold compared to normal.This increased risk persists, even if you repair the undescended testicle early on. On the plus side, if it&#8217;s repaired, it makes it easier to monitor!Testicular Atrophy.Prior contralateral tumour.Trauma is not a factor!Management of Testicular TumoursBaseline CXR, &#945;FP (&#945;-fetal protein), &#946;HCG (&#946;-HCG), LDH.&#945;FP and &#946;HCG are tumour markers.If you see increased &#946;-HCG in a male, then he obviously isn&#8217;t pregnant! So this is suggestive of a tumour.These are specific, but not completely sensitive.So if they&#8217;re there, they&#8217;re confirmatory, but if not, then it doesn&#8217;t tell you much.Radical orchiectomyTake out the testicle!Serial markers.Chest and abdominal CT.Recall that lymphangitic spread goes to the L1 lymph nodes first, so you should do a abdominal CT to look for metastases.It also often spreads to the lungs, so a chest CT should be done as well.Treatment Post OrchidectomyAfter you take out the testicle, the treatment depends on the stage and cell type (seminoma vs non-seminoma).Some options include:Surveillance.Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.Radiotherapy to RP nodes.Chemotherapy.Outcomes of Testis CancerExcellent if treated early and aggressively.Surgery +/- Chemo +/- Radiation.Stage 1 &#8594; 99% Cure.Stage 2 &#8594; 90-95% Cure.Stage 3 &#8594; up to 80% Cure.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/05/01/approach-scrotal-mass.html"},

	{"title": "Urinary Tract Infections", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesAt the end of this session participants will be able to:recognize patient characteristics that distinguish an uncomplicated UTI from a complicated one.recognize the situations where asymptomatic bacteruria should be treated.identify first line antibiotic choices for UTI and recognize when a 2nd line agent is required.identify preventive strategies patients can employ to reduce likelihood of developing a UTI.IntroductionIn the previous 2 lectures on BPH, and Prostate Cancer, we were dealing with exclusively male problems.UTIs are a predominantly female problem &#8594; most patients that get a UTI are female.Why do women get more UTIs than men?The distance from the outside to the bladder is shorter for women than men, making it easier for bacteria to get their way in.Also, the source of the bacteria is typically the GI tract, and it&#8217;s easier for it to get into the urethra of a women than for a man &#8594; the urethra hangs out a little further in guys! :PIn this lecture, 4 cases of patients with possible UTI symptoms will be presented.You will assess, investigate, diagnose, and recommend management for each of these patients.Case #1Case SummaryA 34 year old female, otherwise well, presents to Urgent Care with a 24 hour history of dysuria (painful urination), frequency, urgency.What else do you need to know?Constitutional Symptoms &#8594; fever, chills?Have you had this before?What makes it better? What makes it worse?Any other significant medical history, such as GU surgeries?Sexual history?What other investigations are required?As usual, physical exam and vitals.A urine culture is optional:In a healthy, uncomplicated patient, a urine culture can be helpful, but you&#8217;re already pretty sure this is a UTI.Since the patient doesn&#8217;t have any constitutional symptoms, and no frequent UTIs, and she&#8217;s premenopausal, she&#8217;s uncomplicated.In an uncomplicated UTI, you don&#8217;t have to do a urine culture.Dipstick UrinalysisPay particular attention to nitrates and leukocytes in the urine dipstick!Leukocytes &#8594; very sensitive, not as specific. So if leukocytes are negative, then it&#8217;s much less likely to be a UTI.Nitrates &#8594; very specific, not as sensitive. So if nitrates are positive, it&#8217;s much more likely to be a UTI.In general, if you see 2/3 of the following, then you can treat the patient:Classic History &#8594; eg. dysuria, frequency, urgency.Positive LeukocytesPositive NitratesRememberUncomplicated UTI &#8594; UTI in a pre-menopausal woman that is otherwise well.Complicated UTI &#8594; everyone else!RememberLook for nitrates and leukocytes in the urine dipstick:Nitrates are highly specific to UTIs, so positive nitrates help rule in a UTI.Leukocytes are highly sensitive for UTIs, so negative leukocytes help rule out a UTI.Presumptive Treatment of a UTIYou can assume it&#8217;s a UTI if you see 2/3 of the following:Classic History &#8594; eg. dysuria, frequency, urgency.Positive LeukocytesPositive NitratesWhat&#8217;s your diagnosis?A Urinary Tract Infection &#8594; UTI.What treatment would you choose?We know that the most likely causative organism is E. coli, so you would want an antibiotic that would cover it, with low odds of resistance.Ideally it would also be narrow spectrum, so you don&#8217;t have collateral damage to the GI flora.Septra &#8594; Trimethoprim Sulfamethoxazole.This is a first-line choice in the community, although some hospitals are seeing more resistance.This is a combination drug, which lowers the odds of antibiotic resistance.It&#8217;s also a narrow spectrum antibiotic which doesn&#8217;t cause collateral damage to the GI flora.Hence it remains a first-line choice for an uncomplicated UTI!NitrofurantoinBacteriostatic, cheap, narrow spectrum, safe with the GI tract.But recall from respirology that this can cause drug-induced DILD.FosfomycinNew antibiotic that&#8217;s come out recently, with low resistance levels.Can also be used with an uncomplicated UTI.RememberAntibiotics you could use with an uncomplicated UTI are:Septra.Nitrofurantoin.Fosfomycin.Case #2Case SummaryA 45 yr old female has had 3 UTIs in the past 9 months and presents with signs and symptoms consistent with another infection. What do you do?What investigations would you perform?You have signs of recurrent infection.Since the patient has more frequent UTIs, she would be a more complicated patient, so a urine culture should be done, if it hasn&#8217;t been done already.The rule of thumb is if you get 3 infections within a year, then you should look for anatomical causes for the UTIs:Renal Ultrasound.Cystoscopy &#8594; scope up the urethra.If no anatomical causes are found, then you can assume that this is still a simple case.Dipstick Urinalysis &#8594; as before, look for leukocytes and nitrates.RememberIf the patient has had more than 3 infections within a year, then you should look for anatomical causes:Renal Ultrasound.Cystoscopy.What treatment option(s) would you choose?Either defer treatment until you get the culture results, or treat presumptively, and follow up later.If you have to treat presumptively, what antibiotics would you use?When deciding, you should ask what the patient got last time, and how long ago they were on it!If something worked before, then it&#8217;ll probably work again, unless the previous UTI was recent (last 3 months) &#8594; then it probably developed resistance!So if it&#8217;s more than 3 months, use the old antibiotic.If it&#8217;s less than 3 months, use another first line treatment.For instance, if their previous infection was 2 months ago, and they used Septra last time, you would give them nitrofurantoin this time.Adjust the antibiotic, if needed, once the investigation results come back.What preventative options are there?Hygiene counselling &#8594; wiping front to back, not back to front.Drink frequent fluids.If suspicious of post-coital infections, you could get the patient to take a dose of Abx post-coitally, or get them to void post-coitally.Short course of prophylactic antibiotics, at a lower dose and lower frequency.RememberIf you have to treat a patient with recurrent UTIs presumptively, you should ask them what their last antibiotic was, and how long ago they took it:If the last use was &#62;3 months ago, then their old antibiotic should be effective.If the last use was &#60;3 months ago, then the UTI is probably resistant to the old antibiotic, so you should use another first line treatment.Case #3Case SummaryA 26 yr old pregnant female had a urine culture done at the time of her prenatal physical exam at 12 weeks gestation. She had no symptoms but the culture returned 2 days later growing E. coli.What do you do?You should treat the patient, even though she&#8217;s asymptomatic. This is because she&#8217;s pregnant.The only time you treat asymptomatic bacteriuria is with a pregnant patient.Why does this matter?In pregnancy, the ureters dilate, and there&#8217;s much more reflex back from the bladder. So we have a physiological reflux during pregnancy!So an infection is more likely to get to the kidney in a pregnant woman &#8594; pyelonephritis.Once a patient gets pyelonephritis, it becomes a systemic infection, which is much more severe, and can cause serious constitutional symptoms.So there&#8217;s an immediate risk to the mom, and then a potential risk to the baby if it&#8217;s not well-managed.What antibiotic would you use?Septra isn&#8217;t good in the 1st or 3rd trimester &#8594;Increased risk of kernicterus (bilirubin induced brain damage) in the 3rd trimester.Increased risk of abnormal folate metabolism in the 1st trimester.Nitrofurantoin also has problems in the 1st and 3rd trimester.This would be a case where you would use Amoxil &#8594; Amoxicillin.Even though there&#8217;s pretty widespread resistance, it&#8217;s one of the only antibiotics where we have clear evidence that it&#8217;s perfectly safe for the baby.If the patient is allergic to penicillin, Cephalexin (Keflex) can be used.RememberThe only time you treat asymptomatic bacteriuria is with a pregnant patient!Amoxicillin would be the first-line option.If they&#8217;re allergic to penicillin, Keflex (Cephalexin) would be an alternative.Case #4Case SummaryA 56 year old man presents to the office with a few days history of mild perianal discomfort and terminal dysuria.What else do you want to know?Terminal Dysuria &#8594; pain at the end of peeing.Have you ever had it before?Vitals (do they have a fever), P/E.Surgical history, any anatomical abnormalities.Digital Rectal Exam &#8594; check the prostate.Additional InformationPatient has a fever, and a tender prostate.What&#8217; s your diagnosis?Prostatitis &#8594; remember the lectures from yesterday.This would be Category I &#8594; acute bacterial prostatitis.What investigations to get?DRE &#8594; Digital Rectal Exam.What treatment do you recommend?The prostate is somewhat protected from antibiotics, so a stronger dose and longer duration is required.As mentioned yesterday, the treatment you would use is short term broad spectrum antibiotics until the fever breaks:A penicillin like Amoxicillin.An aminoglycoside like Gentamicin.After this, you would then use 4 weeks of fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin).Ensure you treat them to the complete duration, to prevent transition to a chronic prostatitis (category II).Case #5Case SummaryThe new nursing home supervisor calls your office about an 85 year old man from whom she has collected a dark and malodorous sample of urine.What else do you want to know?How is he doing? Fever? Constitutional symptoms?If the patient feels fine, don&#8217;t worry about the urine. Recall that asymptomatic bacteriuria is only treated if you&#8217;re pregnant!If the patient does have symptoms, then you would send the urine for a culture. But otherwise, you would do nothing.Medications.What&#8217;s your diagnosis?There&#8217;s no diagnosis!The dark malodorous urine could just be due to dehydration, or even what the patient ate!What investigations do you want to get?Get a urine culture if the patient is symptomatic.What treatment do you recommend?No treatment.Additional InformationThe nurse calls you back 2 days later. She indicates that the urine culture returned +ve for E coli. Sensitivities are still pending.What do you do now?As like before, if the patient is asymptomatic, do nothing.Only follow-up if the patient has symptoms!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/30/urinary-tract-infections.html"},

(Recall, sensitive for &#62; 300 mg/day albumin).What is the best test to measure the patient&#8217;s kidney function?The gold standard is the renal clearance of inulin, but no one does it.The serum creatinine is very good for estimating kidney function, but isn&#8217;t sensitive to falls in kidney function of &#60; 50%.The MDRD is the best equation for estimating the GFR, and would probably also be a good test to use here.What is the most likely cause and how would you manage it?High dose prednisone for 4 weeks, &#62; 80% response rate.Kidney biopsy only if no response to prednisone.Cyclosporine/Cyclophosphamide only if the kidney biopsy confirms the diagnosis of minimal change disease, and it&#8217;s steroid resistant.Case 2A 65 year old male complains of recent onset symmetrical swelling in his lower extremities, fatigue and shortness of breath. Creatinine is 180 &#181;mol/L, urinalysis shows protein and blood and microscopy shows red cell casts. Ultrasound shows normal sized kidneys.Pathologically, what type of renal disease is this likely to be?Glomerulonephritis &#8594; the RBC casts are pathognomonic.Note that glomerulonephritis can actually be categorized as:Proliferative Glomerulonephritis &#8594; nephritic syndrome. Where there&#8217;s proliferation of the parietal cells in the glomerular basement membrane.Non-Proliferative Glomerulonephritis &#8594; nephrotic syndrome. Where there&#8217;s no proliferation of cells.So in this case, the RBC casts suggests nephritic syndrome.What is the differential diagnosis here?Type I &#8594; If &#945;-GBM antibodies are found.Anti-GBM diseaseGoodpasture Syndrome &#8594; this is actually Anti-GBM disease where you also have hemoptysis as well.Type II &#8594; If you see immune complexes.IgA nephropathy &#8594; if you see &#945;-IgA antibodies.Henoch-Schonlein Purpura &#8594; if you have IgA nephropathy + a rash.Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis &#8594; if you see ASOT.SLE &#8594; If you see ANA, &#945;-DNA, low complement.Cold Abs &#8594; For cryoglobuminemia. Also Hep B surface antigen and &#945;-Hep C antibodies.Wegener was a German pathologist who also happened to be a nazi, so the name of the disease was changed to a more politically-correct one!Type III &#8594; Pauci-immune GN, aka the classic vasculitities.Wegener&#8217;s Granulomatosis &#8594; now known as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis. Would expect to see c-ANCA.Microscopic Polyangitis &#8594; if you see p-ANCA.Churg-Strauss Syndrome &#8594; if you see p-ANCA &#38; c-ANCA.What additional history and physical signs would you look for?Prior illnesses and infections:Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis &#8594; would have been sick 2 weeks ago.IgA Nephropathy &#8594; onset can be concomitant with the disease.Joint pain, pleuritis, chest pain, rash, if suspicious of lupus.Possible HepB/HepC infection &#8594; signs of IVDU, purple rashes, sexual history, etc.Possible allergic symptoms would be more suggestive of Churg-Strauss.Past history &#8594; eg. you need to know a past serum creatinine to know what his baseline was!Allergic symptoms &#8594; Churg-Strauss will often present with concomitant allergic symptoms.What noninvasive and invasive tests would you arrange?Immunology screening. As said before:Anti-GBM antibodies for Anti-GBM Disease or Goodpasture.&#945;-IgA antibodies for IgA Nephropathy.ASOT for post-infectious glomerulonephritis.ANA, &#945;-DNA, C3, C4 for lupus.Cold Abs for Cryoglobuminemia.c-ANCA, p-ANCA for the pauci-immune causes.Biopsy &#8594; scarring and crescentic glomeruli suggest a worse prognosis. Active inflammation suggests a better one.What treatments might you institute?High dose steroids &#8594; Prednisone, Solu-Medrol (Methylprednisolone).Cyclophosphamide.Plasmaphoresis.RememberWith the treatment of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, you generally need:High Dose Steroids.Cyclophosphamide.Plasmaphoresis.Case 3A 40 year old male presents to your office complaining of weight gain and symmetrical pitting edema. He denies orthopnea and PND and has no stigmata of liver disease. His urinalysis reveals occasional RBC&#8217;s, with no cellular casts and &#62; 3 g/L protein.What general type of glomerular pathology is this patient likely to have?Generalized edema and macroalbuminuria is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome.Since the level of proteinuria is the biggest prognostic factor for the progression of kidney disease, this is pretty serious!What simple noninvasive investigations would you order?Urine Albumin:Creatinine &#8594; has supplanted 24h urine collection as the best way to assess proteinuria.Renal U/S &#8594; use this to assess kidney size, for biopsy. Useful if a biopsy is need later on.Serum Lipids &#8594; hyperlipidemia is part of the definition of nephrotic syndrome.Serum glucose &#8594; diabetes is a possible cause of secondary nephrotic syndrome.Protein electrophoresis &#8594; in case multiple myeloma is causing his proteinuria (light chains).How do you make a specific diagnosis in this patient?Renal Biopsy.What is the differential diagnosis of this patient?Primary Causes:Minimal Change Disease &#8594; most common in children.Membranous Nephropathy &#8594; most common in caucasians.Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis &#8594; most common in blacks.Secondary Causes:Diabetes.Amyloidosis.Lupus.Note: (1) Lupus, (2) Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis aka. MPGN, and (3) IgA nephropathy can present as either a nephritic syndrome, or a nephrotic syndrome.What would be your management?You have general treatment, and you have treatment specific to the diagnosis.General Treatment &#8594; aimed towards the edema and proteinuria.Salt restriction &#8594; non-pharmacological.Loop diuretics &#8594; Lasix.ACE Inhibitors &#8594; proteinuria.Case 4A 55 year old male with a 4 year history of type II diabetes mellitus controlled on diet is referred because of detection of 3+ proteinuria on dipstick. He has a 10 year history of hypertension and a 5 year history of stable angina managed with beta blockers. On examination, he is obese, blood pressure is 150/95, his retina show mild hypertensive changes and ECG shows LV hypertrophy. His creatinine is 190 &#181;mol/L (up from 120 4 years previously). A 24-hour urine shows 5 grams of protein and the 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance is 40 ml/min. Glycated hemoglobin is 7.5% (normal &#60; 6%).What is the renal diagnosis here and what investigations would you suggest to confirm it? What is the significance of the absence of diabetic retinopathy?What is the renal prognosis?How would you manage his renal disease?What other management suggestions have you?If you have diabetic retinopathy, you are more suspicious of diabetic nephropathy (Guilt by association). BUT THE OPPOSITE DOESN&#8217;T APPLY! If you don&#8217;t have diabetic retinopathy,Probably gonna end up on dialysis if this guy doesn&#8217;t get his shit together. - Huge proteinuria suggests significant glomerular damage!Management: ACEI, diuretics for HBP. Drop cholesterol, lose weight, etc.Case 5A 30 year old type 1 diabetic is referred for renal evaluation. He has diabetes &#215; 6 years, is on twice daily insulin and is somewhat casual about glycemic control. He weighs 90 kgs, BP is 125/85 and he has background retinopathy. Serum creatinine is 40 &#181;mol/L, glycated hemoglobin is 8.5% (normal &#60; 6%); 24 hour urine contains 60 mgs of albumin (normal &#60; 30 mgs); 120 mgs of protein (normal &#60; 150 mgs); and 14 mmol of creatinine (normal 8-18 mmol).What is the renal diagnosis here and what investigations are indicated?Microalbuminuria. 30-300.Suggests you start him on ACEI even if he&#8217;s not hypertensive.Don&#8217;t biopsy this pt. clinical diagnosisWhy is his serum creatinine so low and how could you prove your explanation?KIDNEY WORKS OVERTIME. High glucose activating prostaglandins, leading to afferent vasodilation. Prove your explanation. MDRD? Radio-tag scan?How would you manage this case?How would you monitor the response to your management?Case 6A 4 year old female has a history of enuresis and episodes of fevers, chills and flank pain. She presents with dysuria and frequency. Routine urinalysis reveals 15-10 WBC’s, 5-7 RBC’s, 2 WBC casts/hpf and many bacteria.Cystitis? Pyelonephritis? WBC Casts? AIN? Chills, flank pain, UTI. Abx 1-2 weeks. Recurrent infections not normal. Suggestive of reflux? WHere ureter enters bladder may be abnormally placed, possible reflux, infections.Still do blood tests to ensure that the kidney isn&#8217;t scarred because of the reflux (bad, CKD). Basic urea, creatinine.Long Term management? Depends on what you need to do. May need prophylactic long term ABx if surg not option.Case 7A 24 year old woman presents with frequency and dysuria.QuestionsWhat is the most likely diagnosis?Cystitis = bladder infection. Frequency + dysuria suggestive of a bladder infection.What is the most likely organism?E. coli.What investigation is necessary?At this pt. the reproductive system is fully developed.Treat as you go.What is the treatment?1-2 wks of Abx.Hygiene, management strategies.Generic Name Brand Name ciprofloxacin Cipro fosfomycin Monurol levofloxacin Levaquin nitrofurantoin Furadantin, Macrobid, Macrodantin sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim Bactrim, SeptraCase 8A 65 year old man presents with fever, chills, flank pain and dysuria.What is the likely diagnosis?FEVER, CHILLS, FLAAAANKKKK PAINNNN = Pyelonephritis.What determines whether the patient requires admission?If they look like shit.What constitutes a “complicated” urinary tract infection, and what are the differences with respect to the management?Complicated, by definition, is any abnormality in urinary tract (anatomy), longer course of antibiotics than expected.Describe the investigation and management of uncomplicated and complicated pyelonephritis.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/29/glomerulonephritis-utis-small-group.html"},

(versus the true pelvis).For instance, anything between the two iliac crests, above the pelvic brim.Since it&#8217;s the widest part of the pelvis, it&#8217;s known as the greater pelvis.Since it&#8217;s not part of the true pelvis, it&#8217;s also referred to as the false pelvis.The pelvic OUTLET is the most narrow space of the pelvic outlet, between the two ischial spines!Everything below this is called the perineum (genitalia, anal canal region).BONES OF THE PELVIS - Made up of 3 major big bones. Developed as 3 sep. bones.Ilium.Pubic Bone.Ischium. BONY LANDMARKS.Symphysis pubis.Sacro-iliac joint.Ischial Spine.Pubic rami.Pelvic brim like the rim of a basketball hoop.The true pelvis is wider superiorly vs anteriorly.Chart in notes describes M vs F differences in pelvis.Some differences:Angle of pelvic bones meeting at the pubic symphysis.Wider angle = female. (Thumb + pointer finger)Narrower angle = male. (Peace sign)Distance between the two ischial spines (which defines our pelvic outlet).The mid-pelvic plane, aka. the inter-spinous diameter.Usually wider in females.Between the two anterior superior iliac spines (from iliac crest to iliac crest)Usually wider in females.FEMALES HAVE A WIDER SHAPED PELVIS. GUYS HAVE A MORE NARROW ONE.These diameters are commonly used in obstetrics, when determining how feasible a vaginal birth may be during a pregnancy (narrow pelvis = greater likelihood for complications).A-P/Conjugate Diameter.Mid-pelvic plane (interspinous).Oblique Diameter.LEFT = MALE, RIGHT = FEMALE.Pelvic brim typ. more oval in female, heart shaped in male.JOINTS AND LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. ILIOLUMBAR LIGAMENT joining lumbar vertebrae to wings of the ileum.SACROILIAC JOINT unique in the sense that it has two parts.A tight fibrous immovable joint.A synovial component with movement.This becomes significant in females &#8594; this joint loosens to allow for WIDENING OF THE PELVIS.SACROTUBEROUS ligament = sacrum to ischial tuberosity.SACROSPINOUS ligament = sacrum to the iscial spine.Sacrotuberous + sacrospinous more landmarks than functional signif.Create two openings (foramen) &#8594; a greater and lesser sciatic foramen.Where some nerves and blood vessels pass through.WHAT ABOUT THE FLOOR OF THE PELVIS?As it is, there&#8217;s basically holes at the bottom of the pelvis.What fills up this hole?We need something to fill up this empty floor and support the structures of the pelvis.The main support are the PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES.The pelvis actually has an angle in real live.It&#8217;s titled!So this pelvic floor doesn&#8217;t sit horizontally, it actually projects in an oblique direction!LATERAL (SAGITTAL) VIEWPosterior, see the sacrum.Pubic symphysis anterior.On the lateral wall, you see the OBTURATOR INTERNUS.On the posterior wall, you see the PIRIFORMIS., goes out through the greater sciatic notch?What about the floor?Formed by the two muscles: the COCCYGEUS (coccyx to the ischial spine) + the LEVATOR ANI.Coccygeus + Levator ani = pelvic floor, aka. PELVIC DIAPHRAGM.So pelvic diaphragm = levator ani + coccygeus.The levator ani actually attaches to a thickening of the membrane over the obturator internus called the TENDINOUS ARCH OF THE OBTURATOR INTERNUS.Acts like a tendon for the levator ani.Coccygeus aka. ischiococcygeus since goes from ischial spine to coccyx.Where does the pelvic floor meet? There&#8217;s no bone in the middle.They form a sling/hammock there called the Ano-coccygeal body. LIGAMENT ARRANGEMENT.Anteriorly, meets at the perineal body.Posteriorly, at the ano-coccygeal body.See the pelvic diaphragm here.Coccygeus at the top.Levator Ani at the bototm.Leaves holes for the urethra, anal canal, etc.The pelvic floor is SOMATICALLY INNERVATED, by nerves called the:Nerve to levator ani.Nerve to coccygeus.Why can&#8217;t all anatomy be like this? :O.PELVIC FLOOR (KEGAL) EXERCISES help strengthen pelvic floor. These are the muscles you&#8217;re contracting.Pelvic diaphragm sort of like a trampoline/hammock. Nothing bony in the middle!!The PUBORECTALIS is one important component of the levator ani that you DO have to remember.It forms a sling around the rectum that&#8217;s becoming the anal canal.You can&#8217;t to keep the sling tight to keep this bent.This prevents retrograde fecal flow normally.When you need to take a shit, you relax the puborectalis sling, letting you shit in peace.When you age, the tone of this sling weakens, causing more fecal incontinence problems.REVIEW - PELVIC DIAPHRAGM.

Musculoskeletal ProblemsOsteitis Fibrosa Cystica, also known as Renal Osteodystrophy.This is caused by erosions into the bone due to a hyperactive parathyroid.This hyperactive parathyroid is triggered by increased phosphate and decreased calcium.RememberOne musculoskeletal complication of uremic syndrome is osteitis fibrosa cystica, aka. renal osteodystrophy.It&#8217;s caused by a hyperactive parathyroid causing calcium re-absorption.In detail, Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica/Renal Osteodystrophy arises from:Inability to excrete phosphorus &#8594; phosphate increases.Inability to activate Vitamin D via 1-hydroxylation &#8594; calcium decreases.Recall that 1-hydroxylation is the second activation step, which occurs in the kidneys.Without Vitamin D, calcium can&#8217;t be absorbed from the small intestine, so calcium levels fall.As a result of decreased calcium and increased phosphate, the parathyroid glands increases their activity, causing calcium resorption from bone.This is what causes the bony erosions!We often give patients with chronic kidney disease activated Vitamin D to prevent this from happening.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/21/chronic-kidney-disease.html"},
	{"title": "Acid-Base &amp; Potassium Small Groups", "text": "Case 1A 55 year old man is admitted to hospital with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and shortness of breath.Physical ExamSigns of COPD.Blood GasesLab TestValueNormal ValuespH7.357.4PCO260 mmHg40 mmHgHCO332 mmol/L24-26 mmHgWhat is the acid-base disorder and is the compensation appropriate?Chronic respiratory acidosis, with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.With chronic respiratory acidosis, you would expect a 10:4 ratio in terms of the rise in PCO2 and the rise in HCO2.Remember that the acute ratio is not the same as the chronic one!The PCO2 rose by 20, so you would expect the HCO3 to have risen by 8.This is observed, so this is appropriate compensation.What is the likely cause for this acid-base disorder?The acidosis is due to hypercapnia due to elevated arterial CO2 secondary to his COPD.Since COPD is an obstructive respiratory disease, in severe cases, the impaired respiratory capacity can lead to hypercapnia leading to the respiratory acidosis.Case 2A 45 year old woman with short bowel syndrome and diarrhea presents with recent increase in stool production and shortness of breath.Physical ExaminationBP 110/60 lying, 95/50 standing.Poor tissue turgor.ElectrolytesLab TestValueNormal ValuesNa140 mmol/L135 - 147K2.7 mmol/L3.8 - 5.6HCO38 mmol/L24 - 28Cl123 mmol/L97 - 106Albumin = 30.Blood GasesLab TestValueNormal ValuespH7.157.4PCO224 mmHg40 mmHgHCO38 mmol/L24-26 mmHgA decrease in skin turgor is seen when the skin is pulled up for a few seconds and doesn't quickly return to its original state. It's usually a late sign of dehydration. It's clinically not too useful because you'd find this from a history anyway, and it's not very pleasant!What is the acid-base disorder and is the compensation appropriate?There is a metabolic acidosis (less bicarbonate), and a corresponding respiratory alkalosis (more CO2 ventilation).You would expect a 1:1 compensation for a metabolic acidosis (since you can always breathe faster).Since the HCO3 fell by (24 - 8) = 16, and the PCO2 fell by (40 - 24) = 16, this is appropriate compensation.What is the anion gap?The anion gap is \( Na^+ - (Cl^- + HCO_3^-) = 140 - (123 + 8) = 9 \).The expected anion gap is 9 in this case, because the albumin is only 30.So the anion-gap is normal.What are possible causes for this acid-base disorder and associated hypokalemia?This is a NAGMA.This means there aren&#8217;t any hidden ions that are causing the metabolic acidosis!So this is either a loss of bicarbonate or a gain in H+.Diarrhea (loss of bicarbonate), things that impair principal cell function (aldosterone antagonists, etc), and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors could all cause this.So in general:Diarrhea (lose bicarbonate).Renal Tubular Acidosis (gain hydrogen ions).What is the cause of the low serum potassium?Here, it was given that the patient had diarrhea. So there is GI loss of fluid, causing volume depletion (seen in the rise in blood Cl).With volume loss, the body wants to retain Na.In the principal cell of the collecting duct, this means that we have hyperaldosteronism increasing opening of the passive sodium channel.This increases the passive loss of potassium from the potassium channel, causing the low serum potassium.What is the treatment?Rehydration &#8594; fix the volume depletion.Potassium Repletion &#8594; fix the low potassium.Bicarbonate &#8594; treat the acidosis (oral or IV).Case 3A 22 year old male presents to the Emergency Department in a confused state. No history is available. Heart rate is 70 beats/min. Blood pressure 130/80. Respiratory rate 28 breaths/min. Urinalysis is negative. Blood work shows sodium 140, potassium 4.0, chloride 100, bicarbonate 10, glucose 6, urea 6 (all in mmol/l), albumin 40 g/L (40-45). Blood gases show pO2 120, PCO2 25, and pH 7.24.What is the acid-base disorder and is the compensation appropriate?pH &#60; 7.4 &#8594; acidosis.HCO3&#8595; (metabolic acidosis) and PCO2&#8595; (respiratory alkalosis).So this is metabolic acidosis, with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.The fall in bicarbonate is 24 - 10 = 14.The fall in PCO2 is 40 - 25 = 15.With compensatory metabolic alkalosis, you expect a 1:1 fall, so this is appropriate compensation.What is the anion gap?The anion gap is \( Na^+ - (Cl^- + HCO_3^-) = 140 - (100 + 10) = 30 \)Normal anion gap is 12 (assuming albumin = 40).So this is AGMA.What are the likely diagnoses?The patient has an AGMA.So in this case, the DDx is the stuff in the MUDPILES acronym:M &#8594; Methanol.U &#8594; Uremia.D &#8594; Diabetic PKA.P &#8594; Phenformin (Replaced with Metformin).I &#8594; Iron poisoning.L &#8594; Lactic Acidosis.E &#8594; Ethylene Glycol.S &#8594; Salicylate Poisoning or Starvation Ketoacidosis.The patient has metabolic acidosis and is confused, so you would definitely have Methanol on the differential.For uremia, measure creatinine, BUN, etc.Glucose is 6, so diabetes is unlikely.Phenformin and iron poisoning are rare diagnoses.Lactic acidosis is possible &#8594; measure serum lactate.You should also do blood cultures because lactic acidosis is often caused by sepsis in this age group!Remember that lactic acidosis is not a cause! It&#8217;s a symptom!For salicyate poisoning, do a serum salicyate.What Tests would you Order?Mentioned in the previous question:For Uremia &#8594; creatinine, etc.For lactic acidosis &#8594; serum lactate, and blood cultures for possible causative sepsis.For salicyate poisoning, you&#8217;d so a serum salicyate.Serum osmolality to determine if it&#8217;s ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning.Additional InformationThe serum osmolality was 320.The expected osmolarity is \( 2Na + \text{Glucose} + BUN = (2 \times 140) + 6 + 6 = 292\).The actual serum osmolality is 320.So there&#8217;s an increased osmolar gap &#8594; suggestive of methanol or ethylene glycol!What treatments would you consider?Fomepizole &#8594; used now instead of IV ethanol as a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase! You get all the perks (the competitive inhibition of methanol metabolism), minus all the &#8216;perks&#8217;!IV ethanol &#8594; used to be used to outcompete methanol. Now replaced with fomepizole because fomepizole doesn&#8217;t make patients drunk (damn). Still used when fomepizole is unavailable.Hemodialysis &#8594; remove the toxin quickly because formic acid metabolism takes a while (formic acid is the toxic metabolite of methanol).Case 4A 30 year old man is admitted to hospital with fever, cough and hypoxia.Physical ExamBP 110/70.Chest: basal crackles, scattered wheezes.GasespH 7.6.PCO2 20 mmHg.HCO3 20 mmol/L.What is the acid-base disorder? Is it acute or chronic and is the compensation appropriate?Primary respiratory alkalosis. (PCO2 from 40-20 mmHg)Compensatory metabolic acidosis &#8594; HCO3 from 24 &#8594; 20.This seems to be acute, so you could expect around a 10:2 ratio.This is what we see, so this is an appropriate compensation.What are the possible causes for this acid-base disorder?Acute respiratory alkalosis, so this would be caused by disease states resulting in tachypnea or elevated ventilation.Given the patients symptoms (fever, cough, hypoxia), pneumonia would be most likely.Gram negative sepsis for some reason also triggers the respiratory centre, causing faster breathing.Case 5A 65 year old woman with a long history of epigastric pain is admitted with a three week history of progressive worsening nausea and vomiting.Physical ExamBP 110/70 lying and 90/50 standing.Poor tissue turgor.What is the acid-base disorder and is the compensation appropriate?Metabolic alkalosis with compensatory respiratory acidosis.Normal HCO3 is 24, so there&#8217;s an increase of 11.Normal PCO2 is 40, so there&#8217;s an increase of 5.Normal compensation should be 10:7, so there is slightly low compensation.Patients on loop diuretics like lasix will generally be volume depleted, so the PCT will be increasing reabsorption, leading everyone to have a metabolic alkalosis!What is the pathogenesis of the acid-base disorder in this patient?There are 2 reasons:They&#8217;re vomiting out acid!They&#8217;re volume depleted!Because they&#8217;re vomiting, they&#8217;re volume depleted.This triggers the RAAS to increase sodium reabsorption from the kidneys.High Na flow into the PCT also brings with it lots of anions, including bicarbonate.So basically, the body&#8217;s attempt to increase solute resorption pulls in bicarbonate as well, leading to a metabolic alkalosis.What is the mechanism of the low potassium?RAAS activation &#8594; aldosterone activates the passive sodium channel in the principal cell &#8594; increased sodium flow in &#8594; increased potassium flow out.So patients that are volume depleted will generally be somewhat hypokalemic.What does the urine chloride result mean, and why was it measured?In the setting of vomiting, urine Na is not that useful.This is because, when you have metabolic alkalosis, the kidney tries to get rid of the excess bicarbonate, and to do this, it often has to bring cations with it as well, such as Na and K.So even though you&#8217;re trying to keep Na in to prevent volume depletion, there is still some wasting that occurs along with the bicarbonate excretion.In this case, urine sodium won&#8217;t be a reliable measure of volume status, but sodium chloride will be.RememberUrine chloride is a more reliable incidator of volume status, in patients with metabolic alkalosis.Low chloride = volume depletion.What is the urea/creatinine ratio in this patient, and what does it mean?100:1, &gt; 80:1, suggestive of volume contraction.Don&#8217;t forget, creatinine is measured in micromols, and everything else is measured in mmol.TIP: A quick and dirty way to ballpark the urea/creatinine is to just take one decimal point of creatinine, and see if they&#8217;re around the same value!RememberIf the urea/creatinine ratio is greater than 80:1, it&#8217;s suggestive of volume contraction (urea is retained because it&#8217;s oncotically active).What is the treatment?Give fluid to stabilize.Give potassium &#8594; carefully titrate this!Treat the underlying problem &#8594; when the patient is stable.Case 6A 30 year old previously healthy woman is brought to Emergency after a suspected drug overdose. She is hyperventilating and stuperous.Physical ExamBP 110/70, pulse 92, sweating profusely.Respiratory rate 24/min (Kussmaul&#8217;s)CNS: no localizing findings.Lab TestsLab TestsValueLab TestValueNa140K3.9Cl103BUN5HCO312Creatinine80Glucose5Ketones(trace)pH7.5PO285PCO213What is the cause of the acid base-disorder, and is the compensation appropriate?Kussmaul&#8217;s = deep and rapid breathing &#8594; what people do when they try to blow off lots of CO2.Fittingly, the patient is alkalotic &#8594; respiratory alkalosis.With acute respiratory alkalosis, you&#8217;d expect a compensatory metabolic acidosis, with a 10:2 response.However, in this case, the PCO2 has fallen by 27, but the HCO3 has fallen by 12.This is more than expected &#8594; we have overcompensation.If not, why not?You expect a 10:2 ratio between the fall in PCO2, and the fall in HCO3, with an acute respiratory alkalosis.But in this case, we have a higher compensatory response that we expected.What is the likely cause?This abnormal finding is due to ASA posioning:What actually happens is that ASA causes lactic acidosis because it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation.But ASA also triggers the respiratory centre in the brain and causes excessive overcompensation, resulting in a alkalemic pH.So this is actually a metabolic acidosis with an excessive respiratory alkalosis due to ASA poisoning.How would you treat the patient?You would try to alkalinize them to correct their metabolic acidosis from the lactate.This also has other important consequences:ASA-H itself is non-polar, so it can cross membranes:It can get into the blood-brain-barrier.It can get back out of the renal tubule.If we disassociate it into ASA- and H+, we can prevent the ASA from going through the BBB, and keep it in the filtrate.To do this, we give the patient high doses of IV bicarbonate, dissolved in D5W.You could also give them hemodialysis if they have either:Evidence of end-organ damage.ASA &#62; 7.2 mmol/L.In this case, since the patient is stuporous and confused, there&#8217;s evidence of brain effects, so you would give them dialysis.RememberGive dialysis with ASA toxicity when:There&#8217;s evidence of end-organ damage.The ASA &#62; 7.2 mmol/L.Case 7A 35 year old man was admitted for an elective cholecystectomy. He was found to be mildly hypertensive (BP 160/100 mmHg). Pre-operative routine biochemistry revealed:Lab TestsLab TestValueNa145 mmol/L (138 - 143)K2.8 mmol/L (3.5 - 5.5)Cl95 mmol/L (93 - 100)HCO333 mmol/L (22 - 25)Blood GasesLab TestValuePO290 mmHg (80 - 110)PCO244 mmHgHCO333 mmol/L (22 - 25)pH7.5 (7.35 - 7.45)Urine TestingUrine IonValueNa45 mmol/L (0 - 150)K40 mmol/L (0 - 100)Cl50 mmol/L (0 - 150)Characterize the acid-base disturbance.The pH is mildly alkalotic.This is metabolic alkalosis, which is typically a consequence of volume contraction.You would expect a 10:7 compensation, and since the HCO3 rose by 9, and the PCO2 rose by 4, this is about right.What is the significance of the urine K+ value?The urine K+ is within the normal range.But look at how low the serum potassium is! The kidney should be retaining potassium.So this is actually suggestive of potassium wasting!Recall that H+ wasting occurs with hyperactive &alpha;-intercalated cell export, which will happen with excessive Na import from the principal cell. This is why hyperaldosteronism will cause a metabolic alkalosis!What is the significance of the urine Cl value?Urine Cl is only mainly used for volume contraction or not volume contracted.So here, since the patient has metabolic alkalosis, the first thing on the differential is volume contraction.But in this case, the patient does not look like he&#8217;s dry (volume contracted), since his urine Cl isn&#8217;t low!So there must be another reason why he&#8217;s retaining bicarbonate!So now you would consider factors tht cause H+ wasting, which are conditions that cause Hyperaldosteronism or Pseudohyperaldosteronism.As before, these were (CALC acronym):Conn&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; adrenal adenoma.Adrenal HyperplasiaLicoriceCushing&#8217;s SyndromeCase 8A 36 year old brittle, insulin dependent diabetic develops pitting edema to the level of the knees and an elevated JVP. You diagnose congestive heart failure and start him on an ACE-inhibitor and a combination diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride). He returns to your office two weeks later complaining of weakness and heart palpitations.Lab TestsLab TestValueNa140 mmol/L (135 - 145)K6.9 mmol/L (3.5 - 5.2)Cl103 mmol/L (95 - 105)HCO320 mmol/L (22 - 26)Glucose18 mmol/L (3.5 - 7.0)Urea36 mmol/L (2.0 - 7.0)Creatinine242 &#956;mol/L (85 - 120)Why was this patient prone to develop hyperkalemia?The patient has T1D.He takes insulin, and insulin helps shift potassium in cells.Also has a background of renal failure.Amiloride and Triamterene block the epithelial sodium channels in the distal convoluted tubule, preventing sodium reabsorption. This is sort of similar to thiazide diuretics, which block both Na and Cl reabsorption via the Na-Cl symporter, in the distal convoluted tubule.What did the physician do to increase the potential for hyperkalemia?ACEIs eventually block aldosterone activation.This prevents Na flow in via the passive sodium channel in the principal cell.This prevents K flow out following the negative charge in the urine.This is what causes the hyperkalemia!Amiloride is also a K-sparing diuretic.RememberThe K-Sparing Diuretics are:Amiloride.Triamterene.Spironolactone.Eplerenone.Amiloride and Triamterene are epithelial sodium channel blockers in the DCT.Spironolactone and Eplerenone are aldosterone antagonists.Why does this patient have a low serum bicarbonate?Renal failure, reducing bicarbonate reabsorption from the proximal convoluted tubule.Elevated creatinine suggests renal failure. Will have some degree of AGMA. (degrees of uremia).Urinalysis also shows elevated ketones, suggestive of poorly managed diabetes, and possible DKA.How would you manage his heart failure in the future?Temporarily drop the ACEI to reduce K, and reintroduce it later once it&#8217;s stabilized.Use a loop diuretic instead to get rid of edema.Hydrochlorothiazide is more of an anti-hypertensive. It wouldn&#8217;t be as helpful for edema. Take them off of it.Would give normal medication for CHF &#8594; ASA, ACEI/ARB, &#946;-blocker, Spironolactone (depending on NYHA Class).With diabetic nephropathy, you would definitely give ACEI/ARB.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/17/acid-base-potassium-small-groups.html"},

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Retroperitoneum", "text": "Retroperitoneum Anatomy NotesSee Retroperitoneum Anatomy Notes.Muscles of the RetroperitoneumThe Posterior Abdominal WallThere are 4 muscles of the posterior abdominal wall:Quadratus LumborumQuadratus lumborum = Quadrangular shape + Lumbar region.Descends from the 12th rib down to the iliac crest.There&#8217;s a ligament called the iliolumbar ligament, which keep the lumbar vertebra attached to the iliac crest.This forms the bed which the kidneys sit on.Psoas MajorEveryone has a psoas major muscle, and some people have a very small psoas minor muscle, that will sit superior to the psoas major.Extends from the transverse processes of the lumbar bodies, and attaches to the lesser trochanter, which is a large bump on the femur.Since this muscle crosses anteriorly to the hip joint, it acts as a hip flexor &#8594; probably the strongest one.IliacusComes off the iliac fossa, and joins with the psoas to form the ileopsoas (note how the iliacus and the psoas merge inferiorly).So this will also attach to the lesser trochanter, along with the psoas major.Transversus AbdominisWraps around the body transversely, so it&#8217;s a component of both the anterior and posterior abdominal wall.These muscles will become important landmarks for the nerves later on.Muscles of the RetroperitoneumQuadratus Lumborum: 12th rib &#8594; iliac crest.Forms the bed which the kidneys sit on.Psoas Major: transverse lumbar processes &#8594; lesser trochanter.Major hip flexor.Merges with the iliacus to form the ileopsoas.Iliacus: iliac fossa &#8594; lesser trochanter.Merges with the psoas to form the ileopsoas.Transversus Abdominis: wraps transversely around..Hence it&#8217;s a component of both the anterior and posterior abdominal wall.The DiaphragmThe diaphragm is odd in the sense that:The muscular part of it is all around the periphery.The tendinous area is all around the center.The central tendinous area is, aptly, the central tendon.The pericardium attaches to the central tendon from above.The liver attaches to the central tendon from below.The peripheral muscle attaches to the costal margins as well as the lumbar vertebrae.The attachments of the peripheral muscle to the lumbar vertebrae are known as crura. There&#8217;s a right and a left crura. Imagine these as arms attaching the diaphragm to the lumbar vertebrae. Crura/cruth = arm-like extension coming off a body.The diaphragm arcs over the quadratus lumborum, and the psoas. Lateral arcuate ligaments&#8230;Inferior view of the diaphragm, looking up.Recall sympathetic trunk, in posterior mediastinum.Splanchnic nerves coming off the sympathetic trunk, entering abdomen, through crus.Targeting ganglia you&#8217;ll find in the abdomen.SPLANCHNIC NERVE = SYMPATHETIC IN THE ABDOMEN.All of the splanchnic nerves are sympathetic, except for the pelvic splanchnic serves, which are parasympathetic.Recall the ligaments, the median arcuate ligament and the lateral arcuate ligament. Median one arches over the psoas, lateral one arches over the quadratus lumborum.Just under the medial arctuate ligaments are where the sympathetic trunks enter.BLOOD SUPPLY.Internal thoracic artery (aka internal mammary), coming off the subclavian, running along the inside of the sternum on either side, supplies the diaphragm from above.From below, the diaphragm is fed by the inferior phrenic.Anything phrenic = diaphragm.Nerve supply, follow the phrenic down to the diaphragm.C3-C4-C5 keeps the diaphragm alive!Also some of the lower intercostals.OPENINGS OF THE DIAPHRAGM.How does stuff get from above the diaphragm to below the diaphragm?Notice that there are 3 OPENINGS in the diaphragm.T8 &#8594; CAVAL: IVC, R-phrenic nerve terminal branch.T10 &#8594; ESOPHAGEAL: esophagus, ant &amp; post esophageal plexus (vagus), L. gastric vessels.T12 &#8594; AORTIC: Aorta, azygos, hemiazygos, thoracic duct (lymphatic drainage, dumps into junction of subclavian and brachiocephalic vein).Openings of the DiaphragmCaval Opening (T8) = IVC, R phrenic terminal branch.Esophageal Opening (T10) = Esophagus, vagus.Aortic Opening (T12) = aorta, azygos, hemiazygos, thoracic duct (lymphatic supply).Compression at any of these openings will affect the relevant areas.IVC at T8 passes through the tendinous part of the diaphragm.Why is this a good thing? Because the vein is more compressible, so if it went through a muscular hole, it&#8217;d be more suspectible to compression.The esophagus actually goes through a muscular sling! This helps prevent backflow by almost acting as a sphincter.One of the most common hernias is at this esophageal opening &#8594; eg. some of the stomach, or fat, pushing back up there.I ATE, 10 EGGS, AT 12.I = IVC, ATE = T8.10 = T10, EGGS = ESOPHAGEAL.AT = AORTA + THORACIC, 12 = T12.Blood Vessels of the RetroperitoneumBranches of the Abdominal AortaThe aorta comes down into the abdomen through the T12 aortic opening, as mentioned before.At around L4, it branches into the common iliac branches.The aorta has:Unpaired Branches which are not the same on both sides.Paired Branches which are the same on both sides.Unpaired BranchesCeliac Trunk.Superior Mesenteric Artery.Inferior Mesenteric Artery.Median sacral area. Super small, but huge bleeder! Risk in surg.INTESTINAL STRUCTURES.CSI = celiac, superior, inferior.Paired BranchesInferior Phrenic Artery.Adrenal Artery.Renal Artery. (L1)Gonadal Arteries. (testicular or ovarian if M or F)Lumbar Arteries (vertebrae, spinal cord, post. abdo wall).POSTERIOR ABDOMINAL STUFF. (RETROPERITONEAL).I AM REALLY GONNA LOSE!THE AORTA MAN!! Eyes = Inferior phrenic.Nose = Celiac trunk.Mouth = Superior Mesenteric.Arms = Renal.Boobs = Gonadal &#8594; apt!Belly button = Inferior Mesenteric.Lumbar Arteries.Common Iliac arteries.GENITAL = Median Sacral &#8594; big bleeder, because there&#8217;s lots of blood supply there :PInternal Iliac Arteries.THE IVC lies sort of to the right of the aorta, sort of looking like a tango dance. SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LEVEL AS WELL.A: Splenic Artery - Huge artery coming off the celiac artery, heading towards the spleen.B: Renal Artery.C: Left Common Iliac Artery.D: Superior Mesenteric? Recall, squishes left renal artery!! NOOOPE. COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY. GOES TO LIVER.E: Also heading towards kidney!! WTF? Development of the kidney, multiple blood supply, fail to degenerate, ACCESSORY RENAL ARTERY.F: GONADALS.Muscles coming around the vertebrae are the quadratus lumborum.Closest to the vertebral body is the psoas.AORTA, IVC. Longer on the left side, left renal vein.AAA usually below the level of the renal arteries.Infrarenal!Recall that suprarenal ones are tricker, because the kidneys become ischemic somewhat more quickly. Can&#8217;t clamp for as long!Tributaries of the Inferior Vena CavaInferior.Hepatic.Adrenal.Renal.Gonadal, recall left side, drains into left renal vein.Lumbar.Median sacral vein.Adrenal, gonadal, inferior phrenic drain into the left renal vein.The LUMBAR VEINS DON&#8217;T MERGE INTO THE IVC.They actually have ascending lumbar veins that&#8217;ll join into the azygos system.Gives you an accessory/collateral venous drainage.IVC to the right of the vertebrae.Bifurcation level, THE IVC bifurcates slightly HIGHER!! than the aorta does.RECALL THE AORTA MAN DANCE!! IVC above!!Stuff will cross. Ureter crosses the iliac at the pelvic brim, etc etc.EXAMPLE.  SPLIT THIS SHITIs it the same as before?NO! This is a problem with the IVC!How do we know this?The swollen thing is to the right.Obstructed IVC.Would have retrograde flow, causing vein dilation inferior to the blockage.CAPUT MEDUSA. VEINS COMING OUT OF THE BELLY BUTTON.CAPUT MEDUSA = VEnous congesTION! (PORTAL SYSTEM, eg. with liver disease), IVC, etc.Nerves of the RetroperitoneumLumbar Plexus L1-L5. 5 Lumbar vertebrae. Two big branches are the femoral and obturator nerve. seen later in MSK.MUSCLE LANDMARKING.Subcostal nerve (T12) just under the last rib (rib 12).L1 splits into the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerve.Hypogastric area (suprapubic).Inguinal area.Come out on top of the quadratus lumborum. Muscle is landmark.Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.Merged from L2-L3. Comes out on top of the Iliacus. (over the iliac fossa).Goes towards the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) (the bump you feel when you put your hands on your hips).Femoral.Lateral to the psoas.L2-L4.NERVE SUPPLY TO ALL THE ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT MUSCLES OF THE THIGH.DAMAGE - can&#8217;t extend knee, no hip flexion. (KNEE EXTENSORS AND HIP FLEXION)Genitofemoral (L1-L2)Pierces through the psoas. (L1-L2)Splits into a genital branch and a femoral branch.The GENITOFEMORAL NERVE works with the ILIOINGUINAL NERVE to cause ball shrinkage.ILIOLINGUAL = sensory, GENITOFEMORAL = motor.Obturator (L2-L4)Hugs the inner wall of the pelvis.Medial compartment of the thigh - medial compartment muscles (HIP adductor muscles).How do you know this is the psoas, and not the kidney?You can see part of the pelvic girdle &#8594; lower than the level of the lumbar vertebrae.Can see some intestine on the right &#8594; lower than the level of the kidneys (the flexures).Larger vessels seem to have been pushed to the side.Huge psoas mass - prob. due to appendicitis, causing inflammation, spreading into the fascia, etc.Or diverticulitus from the colon setting up an abcess in the psoas.Since the psoas attaches to the lesser trochanter of the femur, sometimes a psoas mass will appear like an inguinal hernia in that region.A hernia is the protrusion of an organ or the fascia of an organ through the wall of the cavity that normally contains it from within.Because of the locations of the nerves, what other symptoms may the patient have?Recall:Subcostal, along 12th rib.Iliolingual + iliohypogastric, branches of L1 CROSSING QUADRATUS LUMBORUM.Lateral Femoral Cutaneous - goes LATERALLY to the ant-sup-iliac-spine. Crosses the iliacus.Femoral - LATERAL TO PSOAS.Genitofemoral - PIERCES THE PSOAS.Obturator - MEDIAL TO PSOAS, HUGS PELVIS.Recall genitofemoral + iliolingual = ball shrinkage! Genitofemoral is the motor component! CREMASTERIC REFLEX!!May present with mechanical weakness due to effects on innervation of the anterior and medial compartments of the thigh.Femoral problems = hip flexion, knee extensors.Obturator problems = hip adduction.AUTONOMIC SYSTEMNerves we just talked about were part of the somatic system.What about the autonomic system?These are seen in ganglia and plexuses along the aorta.Recall splanchnic nerves out of sympathetic trunk targeting ganglia in the abdomen.SYMPATHETIC3 important sympathetic ganglia, which correspond to the UNPAIRED BRANCHES OF THE AORTA.Celiac Plexus. T5-T9Superior Mesenteric Plexus. T8-T12Inferior Mesenteric Plexus. T12From these ganglia, you&#8217;ll have a network of neurons that form ANOTHER plexus, that&#8217;s called the hypogastric plexus.Remember last week when we talked about pain that&#8217;s referred from the kidney or ureter?Kidney pain = putting on shorts = T10-L1.Ureter Pain = loin to groin = T12-L2.So T10-L1, prob through sup. mesenteric.So T12-L2, prob through inf. mesenteric + hypogastric plexuses.PARASYMPATHETICVagus does everything until about the position of the spleen.Anything below that is done by the pelvic splanchnics, out of the sacral region. S2-4.Parasympathetic = pee. Sympathetic = store pee!Anything stringy and rat-nesty will look autonomic neurons. Can see hypogastric plexus along bifurcation of the aorta into the common iliac arteries. - Just under the abdo aorta and IVC is where you&#8217;ll find the sympathetic chain (the STAR THEREEEE!!!!).LymphaticsRun with blood vessels and run with nerves.Won&#8217;t be able to dissect them, they&#8217;ll be in a mess.The IMPORTANT thing for the ABDOMEN is that the lymphatics will go back to the lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels associated with the aorta.Key here is to know blood supply to the organ.Lymphatic drainage will follow path of blood vessels.PARAAORTIC + PREAORTIC LYMPH NODES.Drain abdominal wall, posterior wall structures (ie. diaphragm, kidney, adrenal glands) and gonadsEVEN THOUGH YOUR TESTES AND OVERIES ARE NOT IN THE ABDOMEN, if you&#8217;re looking at metastasis through the lymphatics, it&#8217;ll be in the preaortic paraaortic region.If doing surg to excise lymph node, make pt. drink heavy cream beforehand, goes directly to lymphatic drainage, will be easily visible as white creamy structures. More easily differentiated.You&#8217;ll only know some of these. Others will be clear after the GI block.Enter&#8217;s diaphragm at T8 = IVC = A. CAVAL OPENING.Crosses from R to L anterior to L3 = duodenum FPart of the poop train (Large intesting vs small intesting) = G, or thing above the R kidney that&#8217;s not IDed.A landmark for L1 of the lumbar plexus = L1 = iliohypogastric + ilioinguinal = quadratus lumborum? H? YESSS!Trunk Extensors = L = the huge things back there.In a canal = F (spinal cord + vertebral canal)Nutcracker vessel = Superior Mesenteric Artery + aorta. That&#8217;s C!Drains into the portal vein = superior mesenteric vein.Found medial to the femoral nerve = psoas, since the femoral nerve runs laterally to the psoas. So this is M.Bifurcates one level lower = AORTA!Remember, the AORTA BIFURCATES LOWER.Intraperitoneal organs = E (transverse colon).Pus from a kidney would be retained in this layer.Recall, renal fascia around the perirenal fat.Renal capsule around kidney itself.J is the peri-renal fat inside the renal fascia.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/16/anatomy-retriperitoneum.html"},

	{"title": "Acute Kidney Injury I", "text": "Acute Kidney Injury Independent Learning ModuleSee GU Module 2.Lecture ObjectivesAcute Kidney Injury is one of the most common diagnoses you&#8217;ll see in internal medicine.By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:List a differential diagnosis for acute kidney injury.List diagnostic tests that help flush out the cause of acute kidney injury.Outline the management of patients with acute kidney injury based on the underlying cause.Definition of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)Acute Kidney Injury, formerly known as acute kidney failure, is defined as satisfying any of the following 3 criteria:Increase in serum creatinine of more than 44 mEq/L.An increase in serum creatinine of more than 50% from baseline.A reduction in the calculated creatine clearance of 50%.This one is listed in textbooks, but it&#8217;s actually not very accurate, because the creatinine clearance assumes that you&#8217;re in a steady state, and your GFR isn&#8217;t changing rapidly.In acute kidney injury, this isn&#8217;t the case!One example of when you wouldn&#8217;t be in a steady state is the following:Say you&#8217;re an 80 y/o man with a huge prostate.This blocks the urinary outflow tract, making the patient anuric.As a result, there&#8217;s no creatinine clearance, so the serum creatinine has gone from 100&#8594;200.In this case, the GFR would be zero!However, the calculated creatinine clearance (using the Cockcroft Gault equation, or the MDRD equation), would be non-zero!So the calculated creatinine clearance is a poor measure of kidney function when there is an acute problem.RememberDon&#8217;t use the Cockcroft Gault Equation or the MDRD Equation in patients with AKI, because they&#8217;re not in a steady state!Acute Kidney InjuryAcute Kidney Injury (AKI) is defined as having any of the following 3 criteria:Increase in serum creatinine of over 44 mEq/L.Increase of serum creatinine of more than 50% from baseline.Decrease in the calculated creatinine clearance of 50%.Don&#8217;t use the creatinine clearance because it isn&#8217;t a good measure of acute injury &#8594; it assumes that the patient is in a steady state.Generally, AKI is suspected when serum creatinine goes up quickly, in the span of days to weeks.Epidemiology of AKIAKI is a common problem:5% of hospitalized patients develop AKI.Of these, 0.5% will require dialysis.20% of critical care admissions develop AKI.AKI usually doesn&#8217;t present by itself &#8594; it&#8217;s usually in the context of multi-system organ failure!The archetypical example would be with severe sepsis, where there can be end-organ damage in multiple systems.Etiology of AKI in the Hospital SettingAKI can be split into 3 causes &#8594; prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes:Prerenal Causes &#8594; before the kidney.These are due to impaired blood flow to the kidney.So true volume contraction can cause this.CHF can cause this because there&#8217;s alse volume contraction.Sepsis can cause this because there&#8217;s relative volume contraction due to systemic vasodilation.Renal (Intrinsic Causes) - There are 4 compartments of the kidney that can be damaged, leading to AKI.The tubules &#8594; Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN).The interstitium &#8594; Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN).The glomeruli &#8594; Glomerulonephritis.The blood vessels &#8594; Atheroemboli.Postrenal CausesThese are due to obstruction.To have an obstruction causing an AKI, it has to block both kidneys, because otherwise, your other kidney will compensate to maintain a normal serum creatinine.Bilateral kidney stones, swollen prostates, and tumours are obvious examples.To rule out obstruction, you gotta do a renal ultrasound, to look for signs of hydronephrosis.The most common causes are prerenal and renal causes.You want to rule out prerenal and postrenal causes immediately, because these are the ones that can be fixed immediately.If you miss these, and there&#8217;s resultant permanent damage, then you&#8217;re in deep shit!Rule out pre-renal causes &#8594; do a full physical exam for volume depletion!Rule out post-renal causes &#8594; do a renal ultrasound looking for hydronephrosis!RememberThe Etiology of AKI can be conceptually divided into 3 categories:Prerenal &#8594; something wrong with blood flow.Renal (Intrinsic) &#8594; something wrong with the kidney.Postrenal &#8594; something wrong with obstruction.Prerenal and postrenal causes should be ruled out first, because those are the ones that are most easily treated.To rule out a prerenal etiology, do a physical exam.To rule out a postrenal etiology, do a renal ultrasound.Morbidity &#38; Mortality of AKIMortality rates range from 7-80% depending on patients other co morbidities.This rate has remained unchanged since the advent of dialysis because of increasing age and co morbid conditions.Most common cause of death associated with ARF are sepsis, cardiac failure and respiratory failure.Mortality rates are lower for nonoliguric AKI (&#62;400ml/day) then with oliguric AKI (&#60;400 ml/day).So mortality is associated with the severity of the kidney damage!Patients that have low urine output do worse than those with normal urine output.Pathophysiology of AKIAs we&#8217;ve said before:Prerenal &#8594; a decrease in effective flow.Renal &#8594; damage to the kidney.This damage can be to (1) tubules, (2) interstitium, (3) glomerulus, or (4) blood vessels.Postrenal &#8594; due to obstruction distal to the kidney.Patient HistoryA history will give you the etiology 80% of the time! So it&#8217;s useful to be able to take a good history.Look for past nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, suggestive of volume loss.Hx of heart disease, liver disease, previous renal disease.Do a Hx geared towards obstruction &#8594; kidney stones, benign prostate hyperplasia.Kidney stones will often present with flank pain.Prostate hyperplasia will result in the patient feeling like they need to pee, but they can&#8217;t.Recent illnesses, changes in medication.Edema, change in urination &#8594; symptoms of kidney injury.Recent radiology studies &#8594; dyes used in radiology can sometimes be nephrotoxic.Rashes &#8594; could be suggestive of autoimmune dysfunction.Physical ExamLook at the ECF Volume StatusBlood pressure, heart rate.JVP, lung sounds, mucous membranes, peripheral edema, skin turgor, etc.Look for signs of possible causesRash or synovitis suggestive of an autoimmune response.Swollen prostate suggestive of distal obstruction.Workup for AKIRenal UltrasoundProbably the most important test with an AKI, because you need to rule out hydronephrosis (due to obstruction).This is going to be on the exam! Don&#8217;t forget it.UrinalysisUrine sediment (U/A) &#8594; looking for casts, cells, protein.Urine electrolytes (UNa) and Urine Cr &#8594; to calculate FeNa/FeUrea.UNa = Urine Sodium.FeNa = Fractional Excretion of Sodium (remember SU/P over CU/P).FeUrea = Fractional Excretion of Urea (same idea as with sodium).Urine Osmolarity.Urine eosinophils &#8594; remember that this were suggestive of interstitial nephritis.Acute Kidney Injury Mini Case 1A 75 yo man, NH resident, with Alzheimer&#8217;s dementia admitted for aspiration pneumonia. HR 120 beats/min, BP 90/60, BUN 50 and Cr 180.Diagnosis?ATN from Abx.Glomerulonephritis.Dehydration.AIN from NSAIDs.His creatinine a week ago was 80, so going from 80&#8594;180 is an increase of &#62; 50% from baseline &#8594; AKI.The patient is tachycardic, hypotensive, suggestive of a prerenal cause.His dementia supports a possible cause of the dehydration.Looking at their BUN:Creatinine Ratio, it&#8217;s 50,000/180 = 277!This is &#62; 80, so this is further suggestive of volume contraction.Hence, dehydration is the most likely cause for the AKI.Note: Hyaline casts are normal &#8594; they&#8217;re just empty casts that everyone pees out. They&#8217;re just Tamm-Horsfall protein surrounding nothing.Prerenal Causes of Acute Kidney Injury1. Decreased Effective Circulating VolumeRemember from the GFR physiology lecture that NSAIDs block prostaglandins, resulting in afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, reducing renal flow.This is where we have Impaired renal blood flow. This can be due to:True volume contraction &#8594; hemorrhage, diarrhea, diuretics etc.False volume contraction (with CHF).Relative volume contraction (with sepsis).Renal vasocontriction &#8594; hepatorenal syndrome.Medications &#8594; NSAIDs, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, for instance.Hepatorenal Syndrome &#8594; Where patients with liver cirrhosis don&#8217;t clear certain cytokines that contrict the renal blood vessels.Hyaline casts can be seen, but are not abnormal.As mentioned before, hyaline casts are empty casts of Tamm-Horsfall protein.Treat with fluid boluses &#8594; eg. isotonic saline.Urine Indices in AKIRecall that the FENa is normally around 1%, and if it's less than that, then it's suggestive of Na reabsorption due to RAAS &rarr; volume contraction.These are all indices for volume contraction that we&#8217;ve seen before!Urine [Na] &#60; 20 mmol/L.BUN:Creatinine &#62; 80:1.FENa &#60; 1%.Postrenal Causes of Acute Kidney Injury1. Post-Obstructive UropathyThis is effectively the only cause of postrenal AKI.This is where we have bilateral obstruction distal to the kidney.We can also have a unilateral obstruction, if the patient only has one kidney, and that&#8217;s blocked off.Patients with sudden onset anuria are highly suggestive of post-obstructive uropathy.Primary obstructive causes include:BPH &#8594; Benign Prostate Hyperplasia.Prostate &#38; Cervical Cancer.Kidney stones (bilateral).Retroperitoneal fibrosis &#8594; AI phenomenon that scars the retroperitoneum and the ureters.You will almost always see hydronephrosis on a renal ultrasound.The rare times you don&#8217;t is when the patient is extremely volume contracted.The patient will have no flow out, but they&#8217;ll also have no flow in!Note: Be careful when you fix an obstruction.You want to monitor for a severe post obstructive diuresis &#8594; where all the backlogged urine gushes out.Patients can sometimes end up peeing out a tremendous amount of fluid after the obstruction clears, and end up volume contracted.Then they&#8217;ll go from a postrenal AKI to a prerenal AKI!Causes of a Post-Obstructive DiuresisNatriuresisThis is what we described before. After the obstruction is cleared, the body will naturally try to excrete the backlogged urine.Nephrogenic DIOften times, the diuresis persists past when the patient is euvolemic.This is sometimes because of tubular damage resulting in acute nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, affecting the tubular response to ADH.This keeps the aquaporins open even past when the patient is euvolemic, resulting in volume contraction.Osmotic DiuresisDuring an AKI, there will be a build-up of urea.Since urea is osmotically active, it&#8217;ll draw water out into the urine, resulting in increased urine flow out.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/15/acute-kidney-injury-1.html"},
	{"title": "Measurement of Renal Function", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesList the various ways glomerular filtration rate can be estimated and the advantages and disadvantages of each test.Understand how the urinalysis is a very useful tool to evaluate renal pathology.Understand the utility of various imaging techniques &#8594; ultrasound, CT, MRI, nuclear medicine scans.List the indications and contraindications to performing a renal biopsy.Measuring Renal FunctionMeasuring the Glomerular Filtration RateThe GFR can be precisely measured by determining the urinary excretion of a marker substance that must satisfy the requirement that the amount filtered per minute is equal to the amount excreted per minute.In order for this condition to be true, any putative substance must satisfy the following properties:it&#8217;s neither absorbed or secreted by tubules &#8594; it only gets in via the glomerulus, and it doesn&#8217;t get back out!It&#8217;s freely filtered across the glomerular membranes &#8594; it actually can through the membrane, so it will be representative of the filtration rate.It&#8217;s not metabolized or produced by the kidney &#8594; it can&#8217;t be produced or lost elsewhere, in a way that would confound the assessment.The only molecule that meets all these requirements completely is Inulin.Hence, it&#8217;s the gold standard marker when assessing GFR!RememberInulin is the only perfectly proportional marker for Glomerular Filtration Rate.Renal ClearanceRenal Clearance &#8594; the hypothetical volume of plasma from which a substance is completely removed per minute in one pass thorough the kidney.If the substance we&#8217;re dealing with is inulin, then the renal clearance is equal to the GFR!A subsequent example will illustrate this more clearly.The renal clearance considers the rate at which a substance is excreted in the urine.Note that it does not consider the net flow &#8594; it ignores the rate of reabsorption back into the systemic circulation.With inulin, since there&#8217;s no reabsorption, this doesn&#8217;t really matter.RememberRenal clearance = excretion rate only, ignoring reabsorption.Example of Renal ClearanceSuppose you take an aqueous glucose solution, with 10g of glucose per litre.Now, you remove a portion of the glucose solution from the container, and put it in a new one.Now, suppose you evaporated all the water in the new container, and returned it to the old one.What&#8217;s left in the new beaker is 1 g of glucose.What is the volume that was removed from the original container, that yielded that 1 g of glucose?The solute concentration is 10 g/L, so if there&#8217;s 1 g in the new container, it must have been in 100 mL of fluid.An alternative way of saying this is that 100 mL of fluid was completely cleared of glucose.So in this example, if 1 g of glucose was removed from the kidney per minute, the renal clearance would be 100 mL!Calculating Renal Clearance, CThe urinary clearance of a substance X, aka. \( C_X \), is UV/P, or:$$ \text{Urinary Clearance } (X) = \frac{U_XV}{P_X} $$Where we have that:The \( U_X \) = urine concentration of X.The \( V \) = volume of urine.The \( P_X \) = plasma concentration of X.This makes sense:The numerator gives you the mols of the substance in the urine.Dividing it by the denominator gives you the volume of plasma that these mols were dissolved in.More formally, if the amount filtered per minute is equal to the amount excreted, then \( V_{\text{filtered}} \times [X_{\text{filtered}}] = V_{\text{urine}} \times [X_{\text{urine}}] \).Since the concentrations in the glomerular filtrate and the plasma are the same, then this gives us \( V_{\text{plasma}} \times [X_{\text{plasma}}] = V_{\text{urine}} \times [X_{\text{urine}}] \).Solving for \( V_{\text{plasma}} \) gives us the urinary clearance equation, as desired.As mentioned before, if X = Inulin then \( C_X = GFR \), because Inulin satisfies the 3 properties mentioned previously.This gives us a way to precisely measure the GFR:We can inject a patient with inulin, and use this equation to determine the urinary clearance.Since the amount of filtered inulin is exactly the same as the amount of excreted inulin, its urinary clearance will be the GFR.A normal GFR is greater than 90 mL/min.Practically however, no one does this, because it&#8217;s very expensive, and lab tests can often closely reflect the GFR.In practice, we use tests that best approximate the GFR, while maximizing user-friendliness and cost-effectiveness.	Urinary Clearance	$$ \text{Urinary Clearance } (X) = \frac{U_XV}{P_X} $$RememberMeasuring the GFR using the urinary clearance of inulin is the gold standard.Normal GFR &#62; 90 mL/min.Estimating Renal FunctionSince measuring the renal clearance of inulin is expensive and time consuming, we want good estimates of kidney function.These approximations give us proxies for the activity of the kidney.These include:Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN).Serum Creatinine.Creatinine Clearance.Cockcroft-Gault Equation.Abbreviated MDRD.Bun:Creatinine Ratio.Urinalysis.Plasma decay of iohexol.Cystatin C.1. Blood Urea NitrogenUrea is generated from protein breakdown.Normal values range from 2.5 mmol/L to 7.5 mmol/L.Although BUN level may rise in people with renal failure, it has many limitations, so it&#8217;s not a good measure of kidney function by itself.These limitations relate to the fact that BUN can change due to factors that are independent of kidney function. Namely:The production of urea can vary.Urea is not only filtered at the glomerulus, but it&#8217;s also reabsorbed there.As a result, BUN is a very imperfect measure of kidney function.Factors Affecting BUNNon-renal factors that Increase BUNVolume Contraction (True or False)Urea is osmotically active, so it&#8217;ll tend to &#8216;follow the flow of salt&#8217;.That is, in patients with volume contraction, who will tend to retain Na, they will also tend to retain urea!This is also true in patients with false volume contraction, such as with CHF. In these patients, activation of RAAS leads to Na and BUN retention.Gastrointestinal BleedingUrea is present in the blood, so when you have a GI bleed, the gut will re-absorb it, resulting in elevated levels in the blood.Catabolic StateWhen you&#8217;re in a catabolic state, you&#8217;ll tend to generate BUN.The archetypical example is when you&#8217;re septic. Catabolism occurs, increasing urea levels.CorticosteroidsCorticosteroids make you catabolic, so this will lead to an elevated BUN as well.One example would be patients on high-dose prednisone for auto-immune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis.HyperalimentationThis is where you have an excess feed through TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition).The excess protein gets transformed into urea.Non-renal factors that Decrease BUNProtein MalnutritionThis decreases the production of BUN.Since urea is generated from protein breakdown, if you have no protein, you have no urea!CirrhosisPatients with Cirrhosis tend to be (1) malnourished, and (2), produce fewer proteins due to liver damage.Since there&#8217;s decreased protein production, there&#8217;s decreased urea production as well, since it&#8217;s a breakdown product of protein.Blood Urea NitrogenBUN is not a reliable indicator of kidney function, especially on its own.This is because BUN can vary depending on a number of factors independent of kidney function.2. Serum CreatinineProbably the best test to use to assess kidney function.Creatinine comes from muscleIt&#8217;s a metabolite of creatine and phosphocreatine, which are found in skeletal muscle.This is advantageous, because serum creatinine concentrations reflect muscle mass and will therefore vary less than the BUN.You can&#8217;t have rapid increases or decreases in muscle mass over the short term!So your production of creatinine will be fairly consistent over the short-term.Normal creatinine level ranges from 50 &#181;mol/L to 115 &#181;mol/L.This range is due to differences in patient muscle mass.Muscular people will have higher levels of creatinine &#8594; around 115 &#181;mol/L.Skinner people will have lower levels of creatinine &#8594; around 50 &#181;mol/L.Often you have to eyeball the patient&#8217;s degree of muscle mass to estimate their baseline creatinine.Although creatinine is a more reliable measure of kidney function than BUN, it still has limitations:It&#8217;s main limitation is that serum creatinine doesn&#8217;t change until you lose almost half of your kidney function.So you&#8217;ll miss the early signs of kidney disease if you solely rely on creatinine.In acute kidney injury, where the kidney shut down abruptly, there will be an abrupt change in the serum creatinine, so this isn&#8217;t a problem.But in chronic conditions, you may miss the early signs of deteriorating kidney function, until the function is &#60; 50% of normal.Serum CreatinineProbably the best assessment of kidney function.However, it doesn&#8217;t increase until kidney function is less than half of normal.Factors affecting Serum CreatinineNon-renal factors that Increase Serum CreatinineExcess Creatine SupplemenatationYou can see this sometimes in bodybuilders. Their creatine supplementation will be converted to creatinine, which will affect the blood test. It&#8217;s not harmful however.You have to take a lot of creatine for this to happen!Vigorous Exercise, RhabdomyoloysisRhabdomyolysis &#8594; skeletal muscle breakdown.Both heavy exercise and rhabdomyolysis can cause small rises in creatinine, but these generally aren&#8217;t significant.Anabolic SteroidsCan also cause relatively minor increases in creatinine.In general, creatinine is less easily influenced by non-renal factors!Non-renal factors that Decrease CreatinineThese are basically the same as what we saw with BUN:Decreased muscle massLess muscle mass &#8594; less creatinine waste product.This can be caused by protein malnutrition, so this is fairly analogous to with BUN.CirrhosisSame idea as with how cirrhosis decreases the BUN.It causes malnutrition &#38; reduced protein production &#8594; wasting &#8594; decreased creatinine.Serum Creatinine is NOT the GFR!They&#8217;re actually inversely related &#8594; the higher the serum creatinine, the lower the GFR.Since serum creatinine is also directly proportional to muscle mass, the combined relationship is:$$ \text{Serum Creatinine } (\mu mol/L) \propto \frac{\text{Muscle Production } (mL/min)}{\text{GFR }(mL/min)} $$So we have that:If muscle production of creatinine &#8593;, then serum creatinine &#8593;.If GFR &#8595;, then serum creatinine &#8593;.3. Creatinine ClearanceThe serum creatinine is good, but it misses early stages of kidney disease, since it only really goes up once the kidney function falls below 50%.So it&#8217;s desirable to have an estimate of GFR, which would approximate the renal clearance of inulin.So why not try this with the creatinine?What happens when we try to calculate \( C(\text{Creatinine}) \), like we did for inulin?Creatinine is free filtered, and it&#8217;s not reabsorbed by the tubule.So it behaves somewhat like inulin.The problem is that 15-20% is actually secreted from the blood vessels into the proximal convoluted tubule directly!This means that the amount of creatinine in the urine will be higher than what was filtered out from the glomerulus!Recall that Trimethoprim Sulfamethoxazole (Septra) was used in immunocompromised patients with pneumocystis pneumonia. It's also used in patients with UTIs.As a result, the creatinine clearance will always overestimate the GFR.Because of this overestimation, we generally don&#8217;t like using the creatinine clearance in practice.The organic acid pump that pumps creatinine into the PCT can be blocked by Cimetidine and Trimethoprim, which can improve the accuracy.But this just makes it more inconvenient!Creatinine ClearanceWill always overestimate the GFR because 15-20% of the urine creatinine bypassed the glomerulus and was excreted directly into the PCT.Cimetidine and trimethoprim can improve accuracy by blocking the pump that moves Creatinine into the PCT.It&#8217;s not very accurate, so it shouldn&#8217;t be used.As before, the creatinine clearance can be measured by doing a 24 hour urine collection, and then performing the same computation as before:	Creatinine Clearance	$$ \text{Urinary Clearance } (\text{Creatinine}) = \frac{U_{\text{Creatinine}}V}{P_{\text{Creatinine}}} $$4. The Cockcroft Gault EquationInstead of needing the urine volume and the urine concentration of creatinine, people have come up with estimations of creatinine clearance based on body weight.For instance, Cockcroft and Gault devised an equation to estimate the creatinine clearance.$$ \text{Creatinine Clearance } (mL/min) \approx \frac{(140 - \text{age}) \times \text{ideal body weight (kg)}}{\text{serum creatinine }(\mu mol/L)}$$You then multiply the above result by:1.05 for a woman.1.20 for a man.A sample calculation for a 20 year old woman, with a serum creatinine of 50 &#181;mol/L, who weighs 50 kg, is:$$ \text{Creatinine Clearance } (mL/min) \approx \frac{(140 - 20) \times 50 kg}{50 (\mu mol/L)} \times 1.05 = 126 mL/min$$The Cockcroft-Gault equation shouldn&#8217;t be used because it&#8217;s not too accurate, and actually overestimates renal function in patients with kidney failure!This is the exact opposite of what we want.	The Cockcroft-Gault Equation	$$ \text{Creatinine Clearance } (mL/min) \approx \frac{(140 - \text{age}) \times \text{ideal body weight (kg)}}{\text{serum creatinine }(\mu mol/L)}$$			Multiply this by 1.05 for a woman, and 1.20 for a man.		This is bad at estimating renal function.	5. The MDRD EquationOne equation that is used is the MDRD equation.MDRD = Modification of Diet in Renal Disease.The MDRD Equation$$ \text{Creatinine Clearance } \approx 186 \times (\text{Plasma Cr} \times 88.4)^{-1.154} \times \text{age}^{-0.203}$$	You then multiply the result by:			0.724 for a woman.		1.212 for someone of African descent.	This is actually computed every time you order a serum creatinine from an external lab in Ontario. It&#8217;s used to estimate the GFR.You don&#8217;t need to remember it, but you do need to know that it&#8217;s the best formula for estimating the GFR (much better than Cockcroft-Gault)!It&#8217;s very accurate if GFR &#60; 60 mL/min.But it underestimates kidney function if the GFR &#62; 60 mL per minute.This means that it&#8217;ll often suggest that you have renal dysfunction if you have normal kidney function! So you should only use this in patients that have suspected kidney damage to begin with!But obviously, since it&#8217;s accurate for the more serious cases, that&#8217;s what we want!RememberThe MDRD Equation (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) is the best formula for estimating the GFR!Equation LimitationsNote that the Cockcroft-Gault equation is bad because it overestimates renal function in patients that actually have renal failure! The MDRD equation is better because it's accurate in the patients we actually worry about, and if anything, underestimates renal function in healthy people.Staging of Kidney DiseaseKnow these numbers!Stage 1 &#8594; kidney function is normal, but there are other signs of early kidney disease (eg. hematuria, proteinuria, or an abnormal u/s).Stage 2 &#8594; 60 &#60; GFR &#60; 89.Stage 3 &#8594; 30 &#60; GFR &#60; 59.Stage 4 &#8594; 15 &#60; GFR &#60; 29.Stage 5 &#8594; GFR &#60; 15 &#8594; kidney failure.Stage 4-5 patients are usually the ones that will progress to need dialysis and a transplant.You&#8217;ll also begin to develop symptoms of kidney failure here.Staging of Kidney DiseaseStage 1 &#8594; GFR &#62; 90, but there are other signs of kidney disease.Stage 2 &#8594; GFR between 60-89.Stage 3 &#8594; GFR between 30-59.Stage 4 &#8594; GFR between 15-29.Stage 5 &#8594; GFR &#60; 15 &#8594; kidney failure.An easy way to remember this is that after stage 1, the lower bound always shrinks by a factor of 2 between each stage.For instance, Stage 2 = 60, 3 = 30, 4 = 15.Plasma decay of iohexol. Cystatin C. - Beginning to be used more in pediatrics. - Very accurate in children. - Small protein made in all nucleated cells at a constant rate. - Hasn&#8217;t picked up steam in adult patients, but is common inEyeballing the serum creatinine.MDRD estimate of GFR.GFR PEAKS AT AGE 40.AFTER AGE 40, it goes down.Normal rate of decline is 1 ml/min/year after 40.So if you have 90 at age 40, at 80, your normal GFR would be 50.So when you&#8217;re interpreting GFR, please look at the age of your patient!Chronic kidney disease from diabetes, and you use MDRD to calculate GFR per year, if it falls by more than 1 ml/min/year, then this is bad!What other tests can you do?2. BUN:Creatinine RatioNot helpful in terms of GFR, helpful in telling you what&#8217;s going on with the patient.When the patient is volume contracted, remember that the urea is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, along with the sodium.So the BUN will go up way more than the creatinine, which will just be excreted normally.This change in the ratio is a sign of volume contraction.Namely, BUN:Creatinine ratio &#62; 80 in volume contracted patients.However, this should only be used in conjunction with a clinical assessment of their volume status.Are their mucous membranes dry?Is their JVP flat?Hypotensive? Tachycardic?Sometimes it&#8217;s tricky though, so this lab test helps.RememberUrea:Creatinine ratio &#62; 80 in volume contracted patients.Don&#8217;t forget that serum creatinine is in &#181;mols/L, while the serum urea is in mmols/L!Example:BUN = 15 mmol/L = 15,000 &#181;mol/L.Creatinine = 100 &#181;mol/L.BUN:Creatinine ratio = 15,000/100 = 150.Therefore the patient is volume contracted.2. UrinalysisDipstick and spin it down.AppearanceProteinBloodGlucose &#8594; diabetes.Ketones &#8594; DKA.Bilirubin &#8594; liver disease.Nitrites &amp; Leukocytes &#8594; both tend to increase with UTIs.The POOR PERSON&#8217;S RENAL BIOPSY.You can get a fair amount of information just from a microscopy and looking at the urine.1. RBCs in the UrineNormally, you shouldn&#8217;t see blood in the urine, because it doesn&#8217;t cross the glomerular membrane.So when you see RBCs in the urine, you should think of:Structural disease &#8594; cancer in the kidney/bladder.Obstruction &#8594; kidney stones.Glomerular Nephritis &#8594; the blood could be coming from the glomerulus.2. WBCs in the UrineIf you see WBCs in the urine, you should think of:Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) &#8594; think infection first.Interstitial Nephritis &#8594; only think of other causes when an infection is ruled out.3. WBCs and E. coli BacteriaIf you&#8217;re lucky enough to see both WBCs and E. coli in the sample, then it&#8217;s pretty much guaranteed to be a UTI.Here you see bacilli that are likely to be gram negative rods.So you can even make a clinical diagnosis from urinalysis!4. Cast Cell with WBCsThis is where you see a WBCs stuffed into a &#8216;cast&#8217;.A cast forms because the WBCs take the shape of the tubule.This is because the tubule releases a protein called Tamm-Horsfall protein, that surrounds the WBCs.This is pathognomonic for interstitial nephritis &#8594; a form of acute kidney injury.RememberA Cast cell full of WBCs is pathognomonic for interstitial nephritis.The cast cell is formed because of the effect of Tamm-Horsfall protein, which surrounds the WBCs, and gives them the shape of the tubule.5. Cast Cell with RBCsIf you see a Cast cell filled with RBCs, then this is a medical emergency, especially if it&#8217;s associated with a rise in serum creatinine.This means that the glomerulus has been severely damaged, and it&#8217;s leaking blood into the tubule.The blood is again surrounded by the Tamm-Horsfall protein.This is pathognomonic for glomerular nephritisIf you don&#8217;t identify this quickly, the patient will end up permanently on dialysis!RememberA Cast cell full of RBCs is pathognomonic for glomerular nephritis.This is a medical emergency!6. Oxalate CrystalsCrystals can often be a normal finding.But in a patient with corresponding clinical findings such as flank pain, and a Hx of kidney stones, this would be suggestive of kidney stones.RememberCrystals can be normal, but with other clinical findings, may be suggestive of kidney stones.2. Renal Imaging Techniques1. Plain X-RayOf limited utility.Only useful when you want to determine whether they have calcium based kidney stones.Patients with abnormally high calcium in the glomerular filtrate can have a predisposition to forming numerous kidney stones, resulting in the completely calcified kidney seen to the right.RememberIn general, Plain X-rays are useless, when looking at the kidneys.Their only use is in determining whether a patient has calcium-based kidney stones.2.Renal ultrasound is the most useful imaging test for any undifferentiated patient with a kidney injury.This is because you never want to miss anything that&#8217;s blocking the kidneys.One of the most common and reversible causes of acute injury is obstruction, so you don&#8217;t want to miss that.When there&#8217;s something blocking urine from leaving the renal pelvis, you end up with Hydronephrosis, where the collecting tubules, calyces, etc, swell up.MORE RARELY DONE NOW Intravenous Pyelogram.Takes a long time, ton of dye exposure and radiation.Because of dye exposure.Dye in veinGets to kidney, excreted into calyces.Can get beautiful pictures of the collecting system.Here we see that there&#8217;s hydronephrosis of the right kidney, and there&#8217;s dilation of the ureter as well.The left side is normal. You see one section of the ureter with no dye because of peristalsis.Stones and hydronephrosis seen with IVP (intravenous pyelogram)CT SCANGold standard for picking up kidney stones.But not done for all patients.In patients with difficult to manage to stones, and you want to know the stone burden accurately, a non-contrast CT scan is good. Staghorn stone in kidney on CT. Remember to picture feet coming out of screen!Also used for kidney cancer. - Look at the kidney in this patient. 3 lumps!AngiogramWe would do this for renal artery stenosis.Atherosclerotic lesion on unilateral renal artery.The kidney would detect this as false decreased blood flow, activates RAAS, resulting in hypervolemia, flash pulmonary edema, hypertensive emergency.So worry about renal artery stenosis if hypertensive crises!MR AngiogramBetter for screening.Gives you better pictures, better to detect renal artery stenosis.Reconstructed CT. - Getting better and better.NUCLEAR MEDICINE TESTSRadionucleotide substances into IV.Follow traces as they go through kidney.Good thing about this is that you can actually measure the GFR!Expensive, radiation exposure.Helpful with 1 atrophic kidney, 1 normal kidney.What if you&#8217;re not sure if the atrophic kidney is even working!With these radionucleotide tests, you can do split functions, and determine what percentage of the GFR is coming from each kidney.Unilateral renal artery stenosis can also pick this up.Can show area of scarring based on RNT deposition.Rarely used, only in specialized circumstances.RENAL BIOPSYAs a nephrologist, when do you do a kidney biopsy?When the cause of the renal disease cannot be determined by less invasive procedures. - Only when you&#8217;re not sure with the other tests mentioned previously.So it&#8217;s very rare! • The signs and symptoms suggest parenchymal disease that can be diagnosed by pathologic evaluation, for example heavy hematuria and heavy proteinuria • The differential diagnosis includes treatments that have different treatments, different prognoses or bothContraindicationsUncooperative patientSolitary kidney &#8594; relative contraindication, because if you damage it, they can become dialysis dependent.Hemorrhagic diathesisUncontrolled severe hypertension &#8594; can bleed heavily.Severe anemia &#8594; won&#8217;t tolerate blood loss.Cystic kidney &#8594; they&#8217;ll bleed into cyst, severe bain.Hydronephrosis &#8594; blockage, could bleed into dilated collecting system.Acute pyelonephritis &#8594; kidney infection. NEVER BIOPSY THIS. Sepsis!Multiple renal artery aneurysms &#8594; hit the aneurysm, bad.Renal neoplasm &#8594; we actually DON&#8217;T BIOPSY KIDNEY CANCER.If you see it on CT scan, then we just take out the kidney.That&#8217;s because a negative biopsy doesn&#8217;t rule out kidney cancer!The sampling can be a big time problem.End stage renal failureIf you&#8217;re already on dialysis, why even do itIt doesn&#8217;t matter anymore.Most common complication is bleeding.EVALUATION OF A RENAL BIOPSYLight microscopy.Immunofluorescence.Electron microscopy.Mesangium expanded (pink stuff in glomerulus). - Mesangium is normal, but it can become expanded.IF can be used to pick up antibody deposition. - eg. IgA stain for IgA nephropathy.EM. Look at glomerular ultrastructure.Can see the basement membrane.Dark stuff is deposit, probably IgA depositing in the mesangium.RememberYou do three things whenever you do a renal biopsy:Light microscopy.Immunofluorescence.Electron microscopy.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/15/measurement-renal-function.html"},

Crystalloid IV FluidsD5W &#8594; 5% dextrose in waterUsing % here is somewhat incorrect &#8594; it actually refers to g/100mL.The glucose is added to the water to make the solution iso-osmotic (briefly).Normally, you can&#8217;t give water by IV, because it&#8217;s hypotonic to the cells, causing them to burst local to the injection site.With D5W, the glucose avoids this by making the solution &#8216;isotonic&#8217;, but over time, as the glucose is metabolized, it becomes a hypotonic solution that&#8217;s taken into the ICF.So this is effectively IV H2O.1/2 NS &#8594; Half Normal Saline, aka. 0.45% saline, or in other words, half normal saline.The normal concentration of saline is ~154 mmol/L NaCl, so in this case we give ~77 mmol/L NaCl.So in this case, we give half of that.NS &#8594; Normal Saline, aka. 0.9% saline.This is isotonic saline.It would be what&#8217;s used when dealing with volume depleted patients.Hypertonic Saline &#8594; otherwise known as 3.0% saline.This contains ~500 mmol/L of NaCl.This is equivalent to 1000 mOsm, because the NaCl will dissociate into Na+ and Cl-.R/L &#8594; Ringer&#8217;s Lactate.Has a slightly lower concentration of NaCl, between 1/2 NA and NS (~130 mmol/L).Also has a small amount of potassium and lactate anion.If the liver is functionally normally, the lactate will be metabolized and enter the citric acid cycle, and will generate bicarbonate.So this is a way of giving a patient alkali.Crystalloid IV FluidsD5W &#8594; effectively like giving IV H2O.1/2 NS &#8594; aka. 0.45% saline &#8594; hypotonic to cells.NS &#8594; aka. 0.9% saline &#8594; isotonic to cells.Hypertonic Saline &#8594; aka. 3.0% saline &#8594; hypertonic to cells.R/L (Ringer&#8217;s Lactate) &#8594; between 1/2 NS and NS.

Colloid IV Fluids5% albumin &#8594; 5 grams of albumin per 100 mL.25% albumin &#8594; 25 grams of albumin per 100 mL.Pentaspan, Hetastarch, Voluven &#8594; tradenames of hydroxyethyl starches, each with different molecular weight.These have largely fallen out of favour, because they have generally been shown to increase mortality.Colloid IV Fluids5% albumin &#8594; 5 grams albumin/100 mL.25% albumin &#8594; 25 grams albumin/100 mL.Pentaspan, Hetastarch, Voluven &#8594; starches, with different molecular weights. Not used much now.IV Fluid DistributionIsotonic Saline, aka. NS will go to the ECF only.Recall that movement betwen the ECF and ICF is determined by osmosis.Since it&#8217;s isotonic, there&#8217;s no osmotic gradient. It won&#8217;t enter the ICF!It will start in the plasma, but will quickly equilibrate with the interstitial compartment according to Starling&#8217;s forces.Recall that the final fluid distribution between interstitium:plasma is around 3:1.D5W is effectively free water, once the glucose has been metabolized.This means that it&#8217;ll distribute between the ICF and ECF according to osmotic forces.Recall that approximately 2/3 will be in the ICF, and 1/3 will be in the ECF.As before, Starling&#8217;s forces will determine the distribution between the interstitium and plasma, so this will be approximately 3:1.Colloids can alter Starling&#8217;s forces because they contain oncotically active components.They go into the ECF, into the plasma compartment, and alter Starling&#8217;s forces because they have albumin, for instance.This means that they actually draw isotonic fluid out of the interstitium into the plasma.Hence, colloids are known as volume expanders, since they stay in the intravascular compartment.Other blood products, for instance RBCs, go into the plasma compartment.Since they&#8217;re cells, they don&#8217;t really contribute to the fluid volume of the ECF.Since they generally can&#8217;t leave the vasculature, they stay in the plasma.RememberIsotonic Saline will stay in the ECF only, but will distribute between the plasma and interstitium.D5W distributes between the ICF and ECF according to the osmotic gradient.Colloids will stay in the plasma, and may even pull fluid out of the interstitium due to increased oncotic forces.What about the Others?How does 1/2 Normal Saline distribute?In this case, you split it into an isotonic component and a water component.For example, if 1000 mL of 1/2 NS was distributed:This is 500 mL of NS, and 500 mL of H2O.The 500 mL of NS will go to the ECF only:3/4 of it will go into the interstitium &#8594; 375 mL.1/4 of it will go into the plasma &#8594; 125 mL.The 500 mL of H2O will distribute between the ICF and ECF.2/3 of it will go to the ICF &#8594; 333 mL.1/3 of it will go to the ECF &#8594; 167 mL.The net result is 333 mL in the ICF, and 667 mL in the ECF.To compute the interstitium:plasma distribution, use the 3:1 ratio:667 &#215; 0.75 will be in the interstitium &#8594; 500 mL.667 &#215; 0.25 will be in the plasma &#8594; 167 mL.RememberFor hypotonic solutions, split them into an isotonic component and a water component.Example 1Now the patient is given 2L Normal Saline.This will stay in the ECF, and distribute between the interstitium and plasma in a 3:1 ratio:1.5 L will go to the interstitium.0.5 L will go to the plasma.The resulting distribution will be:28 L in the ICF.14 + 2 = 16 L in the ECF.Interstitium = 10.5 L + 1.5 L = 12 L.Plasma = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4 L..Example 2Now the patient is given 500 mL of 5% albumin.Colloids stay in the vascular compartment, and do not distribute between the plasma and interstitium.In fact, since it&#8217;s oncotically active, it actually draws isotonic fluid from the interstitium in to join it.Note that this isn&#8217;t water from the ICF.This colloid fluid is isotonic &#8594; it only changes oncotic pressure, and not the osmotic gradient!The degree of shift depends on the colloid that&#8217;s used.Because they stay in the vascular component, and actually draw more isotonic fluid out of the interstitium to join it, colloids are also known as plasma expanders.Example 3Now the patient is given 3000 mL of D5W.This will distribute between the ICF and ECF:2 L will go to the ICF.1 L will go to the ECF.Of the 1 L in the ECF:0.75 L will go to the interstitium.0.25 L will go to the plasma.The end result is:28 + 2 = 30 L in the ICF.14 + 1 = 15 L in the ECF.Interstitium = 10.5 + 0.75 = 11.25 L.Plasma = 3.5 + 0.25 = 3.75 L.Since the plasma is effectively diluted with 0.25 L of water, the serum [Na] falls.What to use and When?If the patient is ECF volume contracted, then you would give them isotonic saline (NS), since it&#8217;ll stay in the ECF compartment.Clinical studies have failed to show a benefit of using colloids over crystalloids, despite the fact that they attractive features:Since they increase vascular oncotic pressure and draw more fluid into the vascular space, you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d be more effective in treating volume depletion.But studies have shown no benefit, and they&#8217;re way more expensive!The choice of giving a fluid intravenously or through oral fluids depends on how quickly you want to correct it, and the risk of being too agressive.Although IV administration is faster, rapid increases in fluid volume can be dangerous &#8594; it may overwhelm a weak heart, for instance.How much IV Fluid do you need to Give?Formulae to predict the amount of ECF volume to replace don&#8217;t work very well.In treating hypovolemia, a &#8220;fluid challenge&#8221; of isotonic crystalloid is usually warranted.Response is based on clinical parameters:Is the BP coming up?Pulse falling?Postural changes persist?JVP becoming visible?Urine output improving?Invasive monitoring improving?Is the CXR becoming &#8216;wet&#8217;?If a patient has hypovolemic shock and can tolerate sudden increases in fluid volume, administer it rapidly.If a patient has less severe hypovolemia or they have probably cardiac disease, give them the fluid more slowly.You don&#8217;t want to cause pulmonary edema!RememberJudge whether you should continue/stop giving fluid based on clinical parameters.Effects on Serum ElectrolytesIf the problem is related to water overload (hyponatremia), or water underload (hypernatremia), then consider how the addition of the fluid will change the osmolality.Don&#8217;t forget that when you want to change the osmolality, compare the infusate with the urine, and not the plasma!Giving a fluid that is hypertonic to the urine will increase serum [Na].Giving a fluid that is hypotonic to the urine will decrease serum [Na].Why don&#8217;t you just compute the new osmolality?Why can&#8217;t you just compare the osmolality of the infusate with the serum, and do a weighted average depending on the volumes?Because you would be ignoring fluid losses due to urination, sweating, pooping, and breathing!Hence, formulas to predict the change in [Na] with a fluid infusion are not very effective.NoteWhen your solution has potassium in it, you have to add the potassium concentration to the sodium concentration when determining the total osmolality.This is because Na/K-ATPases will exchange extracellular K+ for intracellular Na+, so any potassium in the fluid will effectively become sodium!Hybrid SolutionsUsually, you can use pre-packaged solutions such as D5W and 1/2 NS.However, there are cases where you may need to make a custom solution to deal with electrolyte losses.One example is when you have NAGMA from diarrhea, resulting in:Lost bicarbonate.Lost potassium.Since the patient is volume depleted, you would want to come up with an isotonic solution that restores their lost bicarbonate and potassium.For instance, 1/2 NS (Na 77 mmol/L) plus one 50 mL ampoule of NaHCO3 (50 mmol of each) and 20 mL KCl per litre.This gives a final &#8220;Na&#8221; of 77 + 50 + 20 = 147.This is close to the physiologic [Na] of 140 mmol/L, so this is isotonic!Don&#8217;t forget that we add the 20 mL from the KCl because K behaves like Na when administered to the ECF!This type of stuff wouldn&#8217;t be on an exam.Maintenance FluidsMaintenance fluids are used to maintain euvolemia in patients that are NPO before a surgery, for instance.NPO = Nil per os &#8594; nothing via the mouth (no eating or drinking).These fluids aim to keep up with a patient&#8217;s maintenance requirements for both fluid and electrolytes.How much fluid is needed to maintain Euvolemia?There is a 4-2-1 rule in determining the amount of fluid given to maintain euvolemia:The 4-2-1 RuleUsed in adults (or children &#62; 20kg)First 10 kg of body weight &#8594; 4 mL/kg/hour = 40 mL/hour.Next 10 kg of body weight &#8594; 2 mL/kg/hour = 20 mL/hour.Every subsequent kg of weight &#8594; 1 mL/kg/hour = 1 mL/hour.Stop at a max of 125 mL/h.Example: a 70 kg male.First 10 kg = 40 mL/hour.Next 10 kg = 20 mL/hour.Remaining 50 kg = 50 mL/hour.Total = 110 mL/hour = 2.6 L per day.This fluid can be provided as 1/2 NS with 20 mmol/L of KCl added to each litre.This will will provide the 70 kg patient with ~200 mmol of Na per day and ~50 mmol of K per day, which reflects their daily solute ingestion.SummaryIn general, isotonic crystalloid and colloid are confined to the ECF, with differing effects on the plasma:interstitium ratio.Free water distributes in a 2:1 ratio between the ICF and ECF.ECF hypovolemia should be treated with isotonic crystalloid or colloid.ICF disorders (ie. osmolality problems) should be managed by comparing what comes out (pee) with what goes in (IV).Acid-base and potassium status will also influence the choice of fluid &#8594; you may need to &#8220;create&#8221; or individualize the perfect recipe for each situation.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/14/iv-fluids.html"},
	{"title": "Cases of Hypokalemia &amp; Hyperkalemia", "text": "Case 1Case Summary75 year old man with rectal cancer.No medications.Presents with sudden weakness and pain in the right thigh.Creatinine 200, Na 140, K 7.5, Cl 110, HCO3 15, albumin 20.Has severe ECG changes; receives calcium, insulin, glucose, ventolin.dialyzed during the night.The next morning, potassium is 7.0.[K] &#62; 5.0 mmol/L &#8594; Hyperkalemia.Recurrence after dialysis suggests that output wasn&#8217;t the issue &#8594; there&#8217;s a problem with intake or shift.He received insulin, which should have resolved his problems with shifting potassium.So it&#8217;s most likely that this is an intake problem.The clue is that his HCO3 has fallen, suggestive of metabolic acidosis.The anion gap is 140 - (15 + 110) = 15, when it should be 6, considering his albumin of 20.This means that he has AGMA.His differential is then:Methanol poisoning.Uremia.Diabetic Ketoacidosis.Phenformin.Iron poisoning.Lactic acidosis.Ethylene glycol.Salicyate Poisoning or starvation ketoacidosis.Here, the cause was a blood clot with an ischemic leg &#8594; this caused the weakness and pain in the right thigh.This caused lactic acidosis and the hyperkalemia &#8594; tissue necrosis resulted in the ongoing release of potassium into the circulation.Case 2Case Summary27 year old man with atypical chest pain and occasional weakness.No medications.Found to have low K, low Mg.Physical exam normal.BP 105/70 (volume depleted).Na 138, K 2.4, Cl 95, HCO3 30.pH 7.5; plasma Osm 290.Mg 0.6 (low); Ca 2.5 (normal).Urine Na 90; Urine K 25; Urine Cl 150; Urine Osm 400, urine Ca low; urine Mg high.Renin and aldosterone both high.Patient has hypokalemia &#8594; [K] &#60; 3.5 mmol/L.Patient also has metabolic alkalosis from his elevated HCO3.With respect to his hypokalemia, this could be due to:Decreased intake.Increased shift to the ICF (high insulin, catecholamines).Increased losses.There&#8217;s no sign of anything that could be causing decreased intake, and increased shift is typically something that only occurs acutely. So this is probably due to increased losses.Diarrhea is unlikely &#8594; the patient would also be acidotic because of bicarbonate loss. Here, the patient is alkalotic.Excess aldosterone activity is possible.With respect to his metabolic alkalosis, this could be due to:Excess H+ secretion.Low bicarbonate secretion.Practically, metabolic alkalosis is due to the excess activity of aldosterone, leading to increased H+ excretion and hypokalemia.His high renin and aldosterone levels are also high, suggestive of RAAS activation secondary to volume contraction.This is less likely to be a primary hyperaldosteronism, because the patient is volume depleted!In a patient with primary hyperaldosteronism, they would have a high blood pressure!His TTKG reaffirms the export of K, supporting the action of aldosterone.TTKG = (25/2.4)/(400/290) = 7.6.However, if you look at his urine Na+, it&#8217;s elevated.This is not what you&#8217;d expect given RAAS activation &#8594; it should be low!Given his hypokalemia, his urine potassium should also be very low, when you look at his TTKG, it suggests that the kidney is actually wasting potassium.This is consistent with diuretic use:You would waste Na+ and Cl-.You would lose K+, because increased tubular Na would increase K efflux from the principal cell.However, the patient tells us that he is not taking diuretics.Calcium sparing is consistent with a problem with the Distal Convoluted Tubule &#8594; Thiazide diuretics or Gitelman&#8217;s Syndrome.However, magnesium wasting is seen with Gitelman&#8217;s Syndrome, but not with a thiazide diuretic! So in this case, the patient has Gitelman&#8217;s.RememberGitelman&#8217;s Syndrome differs from a thiazide diuretic in that it&#8217;ll lead to magnesium wasting.Bartter vs Gitelman SyndromeBartter SyndromeMimics a loop diuretic.Problem in the thick ascending limb, due to a mutation in the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter.Results in calcium wasting.Gitelman SyndromeMimics a thiazide diuretic.Problem in the distal convoluted tubule, due to a mutation in the Na-Cl symporter.Results in calcium sparing.Case 3Case Summary19 year old fashion model presents for routine physical.BP 90/55 with postural drop and tachycardia.Denies laxatives, diuretics, vomiting.Na 138; K 2.7; Cl 95; HCO3 32; Osm 287, with normal Mg, Ca, Creatinine.UNa 36; UK 61; UCl 57; UOsm 563.Metabolic alkalosis suggestive of excess aldosterone.Hypokalemia &#8594; [K] &#60; 3.5.TTKG = (61/2.7)/(563/287) = 11.5 &#8594; very high!This reaffirms the action of aldosterone in the kidney.Her low BP suggests that the high aldosterone activity is a RAAS response to volume contraction.Since the BP is low, this is less likely to be a primary problem with excess mineralicorticoid activity, like Conn&#8217;s or Cushing&#8217;s.As mentioned before, you would expect BP elevation with primary hyperaldosteronism!However, paradoxically, her urine sodium is high.Her urine [Na] &#62; 20, when her body should be conserving sodium to maintain her fluid volume.This is unexpected, unless there was something interfering with the RAAS response.Her urine [Cl], which is a better estimate of volume contraction in a patient with metabolic alkalosis, is abnormally high as well.The TTKG is (61/2.7)/(563/287) = 11.5, which is elevated, suggestive of potassium loss.Since the patient has hypokalemia, this is an inappropriate response, as they should be conserving potassium.DiagnosisThe patient has RAAS activation leading to their activation of aldosterone.Even though they are volume depleted and hypokalemic, they have an atypical renal response, with Na+ wasting, and K+ wasting.Since loop diuretics make it hard to dilute or concentrate the urine, and the patient has a high urine osmolality, thiazide diuretic use is more likely.Since the serum magnesium is normal, this probably isn&#8217;t a thiazide mimicker like Gitelman&#8217;s.So this is suggestive of thiazide diuretic abuse.If the urine calcium was present, a low urine calcium would confirm it, because thiazide diuretics lead to calcium sparing.Case 4Case Summary40 year old woman with myotonic dystrophy.&#8220;routine&#8221; bloodwork shows potassium 7.0.Hooked up to cardiac monitor.ECG normal.Repeat bloodwork drawn.Treated with calcium, insulin, glucose and ventolin.Repeat sample results from lab with K 4.0 with normal electrolytes, acid-base and renal function.The patient has a [K] &#62; 5.0 mmol/L &#8594; hyperkalemia.However, she doesn&#8217;t have any of the ECG changes seen in hyperkalemia:No flattened P-wave.No elevated T-waves.No widened QRS.So your response would be to repeat the test, to rule out pseudohyperkalemia.Since the repeat test turned out to be normal, this did turn out to be pseudohyperkalemia.This was a real case, and the pseudohyperkalemia was due to a strange consequence of the patient&#8217;s myotonic dystrophy.When drawing several blood samples and analyzing them immediately, 30, 60, and 120 minutes later, there was a progressive increase in potassium.In her case, her myotonic dystrophy meant she had an abnormal cell membrane Na-K-ATPase that kept pumping K+ into the ECF while the sample was waiting for analysis!Case 5Case SummaryElderly woman with severe diarrhea for several days.Admitted with hypotension, semi-comatose.Na 145; K 6.5; Cl 131; HCO3 8; albumin 20; urea and creatinine elevated.Urine output poor, JVP flat, no edema, poor skin turgor.HCO3 is extremely low, suggestive of metabolic acidosis.Anion gap is 145 - (131 + 8) = 6, which is what is expected with an albumin of 6. So this is NAGMA.NAGMA can be due to:Excess bicarbonate loss from the PCT.Impaired H+ excretion from the CCD.Here, her severe diarrhea is obviously what&#8217;s causing the massive bicarbonate loss.The patient is however volume depleted, and should have RAAS activation, leading to Na retention, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.But in her case, she has hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, suggesting that she there is something wrong with her aldosterone response.Since her urea and creatinine are elevated, this abnormal aldosterone response is probably due to renal dysfunction.Why is her potassium 6.5?Normally you should have a low K+ due to losses in diarrhea.She was so severely acidotic, this actually caused a shift of potassium from the ICF into the ECF.She was treated with IV fluid resuscitation and sodium bicarbonate, and the next potassium was 3.0!Since the patient was semi-comatose, giving her the bicarbonate was dangerous, because it would increase the CO2 levels.This could cause respiratory acidosis if the patient can&#8217;t blow it off.An endotracheal tube was used to aid her respiration.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/14/cases-hypokalemia-hyperkalemia.html"},
	{"title": "Potassium Handling in the Kidney", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesRecognize the presence of a K+ disorder and describe the pathophysiology.Provide the differential diagnosis.Describe the appropriate management.Why is Potassium Important?K+ is the major intracellular cation, and is pumped into the ICF via Na/K ATPases.K+ in the ECF is low &#8594; between 3.5-5.0 mmol/L.K+ in the ICF is high &#8594; 150 mmol/LThe total body K is huge, between 2500-4500 mmol.Altered membrane potential can lead to neuromuscular dysfunction and cardiac rhythm disturbances &#8594; life threatening!Abnormal ECG Findings with Altered PotassiumECG Changes with HyperkalemiaPeaked T-Wave &#8594; early change.

The faster the urine flows, the faster the local gradient of potassium can be dealt with.Since slow flow increases the local gradient, it affects secretion.Likewise, inadequate urinary Na+ can impair principal cell function.Since the flow in of Na+ is needed to establish the negatively charged urine by which K flows out, we need urinary sodium!In alkalotic states, less H+ is available for secretion by the &#945;-intercalated cell, hence favouring K+ secretion.There&#8217;s less exchange of H+ out for K+ in, because the body wants to preserve protons.This increases K+ out.Other factors in K+ HandlingThe primary one is aldosterone activity.Secondary factors include:ADH.Low Urine flow.Low Urine Na+.Alkalosis leading to H+ sparing.The Immediate K+ ResponseIncreasing the K+ secretion from the kidney is effective, but it takes a long time.So What happens when you eat a few bananas?This is effectively a huge bolus of potassium that goes directly into the ECF.So acutely, wouldn&#8217;t it trigger hyperkalemia &#8594; arrythmias &#8594; death?No, because the body can immediately shift potassium from the ECF &#8594; ICF.This is done with insulin and catecholamines.Remember(1) Insulin and (2) Catecholamines are responsible for immediately shifting potassium into the ICF.Potassium DisordersThese typically arise when 2 out of 3 mechanisms are not working properlyIntake &#8594; e.g. diet, tissue necrosis, massive hemolysisOutput &#8594; mostly through kidneys in response to aldosterone, some from GI tractShift &#8594; insulin, beta-receptors, Na/K-ATPase, rare diseases (familial periodic paralysis), rapid cell expansion (vitamin B12 for pernicious anemia)Things that cause cells to break cause the ICF potassium to leak into the ECF.That&#8217;s why hemolysis or tissue necrosis can increase K &#8216;intake&#8217;.For example, a Falciparum malariae infection, that results in cell lysis, can cause a sudden increase in plasma K.When 1 of the 3 is affected, the other 2 mechanisms can usually compensate.It&#8217;s only when 2 or more are affected that problems begin to arise.RememberPotassium disorders arise when 2 out of 3 of the following mechanisms are impaired:Intake &#8594; eg. diet, tissue necrosis, massive hemolysis.Output &#8594; mostly through kidneys, some from GI tract.Shift &#8594; insulin, catacholamines.When there&#8217;s a potassium problem, usually the first thing to look at is the urine potassium.If the kidney is responding normally, it should be low if the patient has hypokalemia, and high if the patient has hyperkalemia.If this isn;&#8217;t happening, this is suggestive of an aldosterone/renal problem.In GeneralCheck the Urine K to see if there&#8217;s a normal/abnormal response.If there&#8217;s a normal response &#8594; extra-renal problem.If there&#8217;s an abnormal response &#8594; aldosterone/renal problem.What is the TTKG?As mentioned last week, the concentration of urine electrolytes varies significantly depending on the degree of dilution. So you have to interpret them while taking into account dilution!Just like how we had to measure the fractional excretion of sodium with the Su/p over Cu/p formula, we also have to take into account dilution when assessing potassium.This is done with the TTKG &#8594; the transtubular potassium gradient.This gives you an estimate of the potassium gradient between the lumen of the CCD and the blood.If aldosterone is present and working, then we can generate a high potassium gradient gradient (TTKG &gt; 7)If aldosterone is absent or blocked, or there is inadequate urine Na+ and flow, then we cannot generate a high gradient (TTKG &lt; 2)$$TTKG = \frac{[K^+]_{\text{urine}} \times \text{Osm}_{\text{blood}}}{[K^+]_{\text{blood}} \times \text{Osm}_{\text{urine}}}$$Since this is very similar to the FENa, which was Su/p over Cu/p, we can use a similar mnemonic.The TTKG can be considered as Ku/p over Ou/p.Ku/p is the urine potassium divided by the plasma potassium.Ou/p is the urine osmolality divided by the plasma osmolalityWhat is the potassium in the CCD that my principal cells are working against?

HypokalemiaRememberHypokalemia = [K+] &#60; 3.5 mmol/L.Causes of HypokalemiaHypokalemia = [K+] &#60; 3.5 mmol/L.Remember that potassium problems are due to 2 of (1) input, (2) output, and (3) shift.Decreased Input &#8594; decreased intake (didn&#8217;t eat enough potassium).Increased OutputGI losses from diarrhea.Vomiting or N/G losses, leading to volume contraction, activation of RAAS, and K-loss due to aldosterone activation.Hyperaldosteronism/Pseudohyperaldosteronism (Conn&#8217;s, Adrenal hyperplasia, Licorice, Cushings).Urinary losses due to loop/thiazide diuretics or their imitators (Bartter&#8217;s/Gitelman&#8217;s).Excess Shift into the ECFExcess insulin or catecholamines (as mentioned before).Hereditary periodic paralysis (rare).Loop/Thiazide diuretics lead to hypokalemia because they increase luminal sodium (either through blocking the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter, or the Na/Cl symporter).This increases Na+ influx via the passive sodium channel in the CCD, resulting in increased K+ efflux.RememberLoop Diuretics and Thiazide Diuretics lead to hypokalemia.Potassium Sparing Diuretics and Aldosterone Antagonists lead to hyperkalemia.Clinical Assessment of HypokalemiaFirst thing you should do is to take a history:Do you have diarrhea?Are you on loop/thiazide diuretics?Do you have a relative from the Netherlands that buys you exotic licorice?Note that the appropriate kidney response is to conserve K, so if you have hypokalemia, and urine [K] &#62; 30 or TTKG &#62; 7, suspect renal wasting or excess aldosterone.If they have a high urinary potassium, check whether the patient is acidotic or alkalotic.If they&#8217;re acidotic, then it could be:Type I RTA &#8594; hypokalemic distal RTA, problem with the &#945;-intercalated cell. Since principal cell function is normal, you have K-wasting.Type II RTA &#8594; proximal tubular RTA, excess bicarbonate excretion.Diabetic Ketoacidosis &#8594; remember this was an AGMA DDx. Hypokalemia is due to the massive osmotic diuresis, dragging some K with it.If they&#8217;re alkalotic, this is what you&#8217;d expect with excess aldosterone activity.If they have hypertension, this is suggestive of mineralicorticoid (aldosterone) excess &#8594; Na+ sparing leads to hypertension, and K wasting leads to the hypokalemia.If they don&#8217;t have hypertension, this is suggestive of vomiting, Bartter&#8217;s/Gitelman&#8217;s, or a Loop/Thiazide diuretic.This is because they prevent reabsorption of Na+ earlier in the tubule, increasing the gradient at the CCD, increasing K loss.If they have a low urinary potassium, this is the normal response, suggesting that there&#8217;s something wrong with reduced intake or excess output (diuretics, vomiting, GI losses).If alkalotic, it&#8217;s probably recovery after vomiting/remote diuretics. There&#8217;s no more renal wasting, but the patient is still a little alkalotic right after.If acidotic, it&#8217;s probably GI losses.General Rules of ThumbIntake, Output, Shift!Since the appropriate response of the kidney is to conserve K, suspect renal wasting or excess aldosterone, if either:Urine [K] &#62; 30.TTKG &#62; 7.If it&#8217;s metabolic alkalosis, this is the expected behaviour with excess mineralicorticoid activation (&#8593;&#945;-intercalated cell activity).So this would be suggestive of Conn&#8217;s, Adrenal hyperplasia, Licorice, Cushings, etc.If it&#8217;s metabolic acidosis, this could be diarrhea or renal tubular acidosis.If the Urine [Na] &#62; 20 with ECF contraction, then this is probably due a diuretic, or Bartter&#8217;s/Gitelman&#8217;s.Remember that loop/thiazide diuretics increase urinary Na, and lead to hypokalemia.Treatment of HypokalemiaTreating hypokalemia is important, because muscles can stop moving when potassium gets too low.This is also true in cases where treatment will exacerbate the hyperkalemia.eg. Insulin in a patient with DKA &#8594; adding insulin causes K to shift into the ICF, causing hypokalemia.Oral therapy is preferred &#8594; absorption is slower, so it&#8217;s harder to give too much and cause dangerous hyperkalemia!IV therapy but not be highly concentrated or given at a high rate (&#60;40 mmol/hour), or you can kill someone!High-dose IV potassium is actually how prisoners are executed!The body can&#8217;t shift the potassium fast enough, causing the heart to arrest.RememberOral K therapy is safer.IV K therapy must be done carefully and slowly, and at a rate &#60; 40 mmol/hour.HyperkalemiaRememberHypokalemia = [K+] &#62; 5.0 mmol/L.Causes of HyperkalemiaHypokalemia = [K+] &#62; 5.0 mmol/L.Remember that potassium problems are due to 2 of (1) input, (2) output, and (3) shift.Increased InputCrazy banana ingestion.Significant hemolysis (eg. from serious burns), or tissue necrosis.Decreased OutputTypically renal.Inadequate aldosterone (eg. Addison&#8217;s disease), renal failure, low urine output, or low urine sodium.Drugs that interfere with K excretion:K-sparing diuretics, aldosterone antagonists.ACEI, ARBs, aliskiren (renin inhibitor).NSAIDs, coxibs, heparin.Shift into the ECF, or less ICF shiftLow insulin.Blocked catecholamines &#8594; beta-blockers.Succinylcholine/Digitalis toxicity &#8594; interfere with Na+/K+ ATPases.Diabetics are hard to treat because they may have hyperkalemia due to their low insulin, but they may also have hypokalemia due to their osmotic diuresis leading to a high urine flow.Their potassium can be anywhere!What&#8217;s worse, is that when you treat them with insulin, this can cause their potassium to drop past where you want it to go, because of excess ICF shifting.RememberLoop Diuretics and Thiazide Diuretics lead to hypokalemia.Potassium Sparing Diuretics and Aldosterone Antagonists lead to hyperkalemia.Clinical Assessment of HyperkalemiaSince many medications can affect K excretion, a careful medication history and renal function tests are done first.The appropriate response of the kidneys is to eliminate excess K, so suspect impaired secretion and inadequate aldosterone if:Urine [K] &#60; 30.TTKG &#60; 2.If it&#8217;s metabolic acidosis, it would suggest Type IV RTA:Remember, this was also known as Hyperkalemic Type IV RTA.Dysfunction in aldosterone leads to problems with both the principal cell and the &#945;-intercalated cell.Pseudohyperkalemia may occur if the sample has been hemolyzed:If the blood sample was poorly taken care of, or extracted too vigourously, then you may have excess RBC lysis, causing flooding of potassium into the ECF.So when you have a blood sample showing hyperkalemia with putative hemolysis, the best thing to do is to take an ECG.If the ECG is normal, then you can repeat the test, and not have to worry about imininent medical risks.If the ECG is abnormal, then this is true hyperkalemia that must be dealt with!RememberIf you suspect pseudohyperkalemia, then you should take an ECG and rule out abnormalities characteristic of hyperkalemia (elevated T-wave, widened QRS, etc).Look at Urine K to verify if the kidney is responding appropriately.If Urine [K] &#60; 30, or TTKG &#60; 2, then this is abnormal, since the kidney should be trying to waste potassium.So suspect inadequate aldosterone.Your first step should be to look for medications that affect aldosterone (ACEI, ARB, NSAIDS, etc).If you still don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on, you can measure renin, and aldosterone, and begin to suspect more insidious causes such as Addison&#8217;s.If the Urine K is as expected (high), then this is the appropriate output response.So consider inappropriate shift (low insulin/catecholamines) and/or increased intake.Treatment for HyperkalemiaEnsure that this isn&#8217;t pseudohyperkalemia &#8594; do an ECG!1. Immediate TreatmentThe immediate treatment of hyperkalemia is actually calcium.This is via 1-ampoule of 10% calcium gluconate.Although hyperkalemia affects all parts of the body, the one that actually kills you is the cardiac problems.So instead of fixing the high potassium first, what we do is prevent the deadly arrythmias!Since hyperkalemia increases the resting potential, calcium is used to increase the threshold potential to a point where the gap is normal again.What calcium does is increase the threshold potential, restoring the normal difference between the threshold potential and the resting membrane potential.The mechanism by which calcium does this is still somewhat unclear.2. Secondary TreatmentOnce the risk of fatal arrythmias is dealt with, the next step is to shift the potassium from the ECF into the ICF.This is because shifting the potassium is faster than eliminating it.Glucose is added to the insulin to prevent the glucose levels from falling too low. If the patient is hyperglycemic, then you don't need to add it.As discussed before, treatments for this are insulin and catecholamines:Insulin-Glucose.Beta-agonist.Bicarbonate is used if there&#8217;s concomitant severe metabolic acidosis.3. Tertiary TreatmentEliminate the potassium now that the acute problems have been dealt with.The best way is to eliminate it renally:Loop diuretics &#8594; block the Na/K/2Cl co-transporter.Mineralicorticoids &#8594; increase activity of the passive sodium channel.If you have renal failure, then you should eliminate it through the GI tract, or use dialysis:Osmotic laxatives/K-binding resins (Kayexalate, Sorbitol).Dialysis.Treatment of HyperkalemiaCalcium &#8594; raise the cardiac threshold potential.Insulin + Catecholamines &#8594; shift the K from the ECF &#8594; ICF.Eliminate the potassium:Loop diuretics and Mineralicorticoids if their renal function is okay.Osmotic Laxatives, K-binding resins, and dialysis if there&#8217;s renal failure.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/14/potassium-handling-kidney.html"},

Since the albumin is 40, this is normal.Hence this is N.We want to know whether this is due to a loss of bicarbonate or a preservation of H+.In this case it&#8217;s obvious it&#8217;s the former, because the patient has had severe diarrhea, causing GI losses of bicarbonate.Case 248 year old woman with Sjogren&#8217;s Syndrome.pH 7.14, pCO2 30, HCO3 10.Anion gap not elevated, plasma K 2.0.Urine Na = 25 mmol/L, urine K = 35 mmol/L, urine Cl = 30 mmol/L, urine pH = 6.0.Acidosis, metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.Drop in the HCO3 of 14, so you would expect a 1:1 drop in the pCO2. We see a fall of 10, so it&#8217;s not quite there.The anion gap is not elevated &#8594; this is N.Is this due to a loss of bicarbonate or a failure to secrete H+?Looking at the urine anion gap, we see that 30 (Cl) &#60; 25 (Na) + 35 (K).This suggests that we don&#8217;t have NH4 in the urine, making it more suggestive of a failure to secrete H+.Now that there&#8217;s a failure to secrete H+ which we know occurs at the &#945;-intercalated cell, we want to know if it&#8217;s Type I RTA, or Type IV RTA.Remember that Type I RTA was hypokalemic RTA, which was a problem with the &#945;-intercalated cell only.Remember that Type IV RTA was hyperkalemic RTA, which was a problem with the principal cell, affecting the &#945;-intercalated cell too.In this case, since the plasma potassium is low (&#60;5 mmol/L), this is suggestive of Type I RTA &#8594; which we said was very rare.In the end, a kidney biopsy reveals a lack of H+-ATPases in the cortical collecting duct, due to auto-antibodies.Case 312 year old boy with polyuria, thirst, weakness.pH 7.22, PCO2 25, HCO3 10.Na 126, K 5.5, Cl 89, Anion gap = 126 - (89 + 10) = 27.Glucose - 30, Serum Osm = 310.Urinary ketones +++.Metabolic Acidosis, with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.Fall in 14 in HCO3, with a fall in 15 in PCO2 &#8594; this is appropriate 1:1 compensation.The anion gap = 27 &#8594; AGMA.The differential is the stuff in MUDPILES:MUDPILES AcronymThe differential diagosis for an AGMA is:M &#8594; Methanol.U &#8594; Uremia.D &#8594; Diabetic PKA.P &#8594; Phenformin (Replaced with Metformin).I &#8594; Iron poisoning.L &#8594; Lactic Acidosis.E &#8594; Ethylene Glycol.S &#8594; Salicylate Poisoning or Starvation Ketoacidosis.In this case, the rise in ketones is suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).The high potassium is due to a lack of insulin, hence treatment will lead to hypokalemia &#38; possible arrythmias.The acidosis will correct quickly with insulin, hence bicarbonate therapy is not needed.There&#8217;s hyponatremia &#8594; however the plasma osmolality is high.Remember that this was pseudohyponatremia &#8594; glucose in the blood draws water into the plasma, diluting the Na.Here, cells are actually shrinking, not swelling.Case 435 year old woman with 6 months history of weakness, malaise, low BP, skin appears darker than usualNa 128; K 5.9; Cl 99; HCO3 20; serum Osm 275; albumin 30pH 7.36; pCO2 36Urine Na = 47, urine K = 15, urine Cl = 54, urine Osm = 550.Acidosis, primary metabolic acidosis, with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.This compensation is appropriate (1:1).Is this AGMA or N?In this case, the anion gap is 128 - (99 + 20) = 9.However, the albumin is 30, so the expected anion gap is 9.So this is N.Since this is N, is this a problem with bicarbonate loss, or a failure to secrete H+?Looking at the urine anion gap, we see that 54 (Cl) &#60; 47 (Na) + 15 (K), meaning that there probably isn&#8217;t any NH4 in the urine.This is suggestive of a failure to secrete H+.Is this Type I RTA or Type IV RTA?Looking at the serum potassium, we see that it&#8217;s elevated (5.9).This is suggestive of hyperkalemic distal RTA &#8594; Type IV RTA.So this is an aldosterone problem.In this case, the diagnosis was Addison&#8217;s Disease.In this case, the patient wasn&#8217;t on any medications.She has a chronic illness, with hyperpigmentation.Hyperpigmentation is a feature of Addison&#8217;s disease &#8594; autoimmune attack on the adrenal glands, affecting aldosterone production.AddendumWith the stuff from the Potassium Handling Lecture, we can also add that:Serum K = 5.9 so she has hyperkalemia.Her urine K = 15, so it looks like her renal function is normal.However, when you look at her TTKG:	\begin{align}		TTKG &amp;= \frac{[K]_u/[K]_p}{[\text{Osm}]_u/[\text{Osm}]_p}\\		&amp;= \frac{15/5.9}{550/275}		&amp;= 1.3	\end{align}Her TTKG &#60; 2.

	{"title": "Acid Base Physiology", "text": "Acid-Base Independent Learning ModuleSee GU Module 1.Lecture ObjectivesShould be able to examine an arterial blood gas and electrolyte panel and recognize the presence of the acid-base disorder and describe pathophysiology.Provide a differential diagnosis.Describe appropriate management.See the previous lecture from Respiration &#38; Airways on Blood Gas Analysis for the respiratory component of blood gas analysis.Why is Acid-Base Homeostasis Important?Respiration generates CO2, which has to be gotten rid of, as it generates carbonic acid as it combines with acid.Food ingestion (especially proteins) also increases acids in the blood.pH is maintained in a narrow range between 7.35 and 7.45.pH outside 6.8 to 7.8 results in permanent cell damage and death.Recall that enzymatic function is highly pH dependent.So a pH far outside of the normal range can have far reaching consequences!Acid-Base TerminologySome labs report the total CO2 or tCO2 instead of the HCO3. The total is the combination of HCO3 and dissolved CO2 which is quite trivial, so these values are usually very close to one another and can be used interchangeably.Arterial Blood Gas (ABG), provides the PaCO2, the pH and the HCO3.Acidosis is a process that tends to lower the pH.PaCO2&#8593;, or HCO3&#8595;Alkalosis is a process that tends to raise the pH.PaCO2&#8595;, or HCO3&#8593;Acidemia is a low pH.Alkalemia is a high pH.Don&#8217;t confuse acidosis/alkalosis with acidemia/alkalemia!The Anion GapThe anion gap (AG) is the difference between the predominant cation (Na+), and the two predominant anions (Cl- and HCO3-) of the ECF.We don&#8217;t include K+, because it&#8217;s actively pumped out of the ECF, and has a low concentration in the plasma (&#60; 5 mmol/L).The Anion Gap$$ \text{Anion Gap} = [\text{Na}^+] - \left( [\text{Cl}^-] + [\text{HCO_3}^-] \right)$$The normal anion gap is 12 &#8594; this is due to the presence of negatively charged proteins, especially albumin.The difference between the observed and expected anion gap is the \( \Delta AG \), and should usually be 0.If the \( \Delta AG \) is elevated, this means that there are lots of unaccounted for anions! This is worrisome.Correcting the Anion GapSince the normal anion gap is mainly due to the presence of negatively charged albumin, you have to correct the anion gap when the albumin levels deviate from normal.This could be seen with liver disease, where the liver isn&#8217;t producing proteins properly.Or with protein malnutrition (Kwashiorkor).The normal serum albumin is 40 g/L. For each 10 g/L&#8595; in albumin, you have to decrease the expected anion gap by 3.In other words, the fractional change in the albumin corresponds to the fractional change in the expected anion gap.If the albumin was half of 40, the expected anion gap would be half of 12, or 6.RememberNormal albumin = 40 g/L.For a 10 g/L fall in albumin, drop the expected anion gap by 3.How does the Kidney regulate Acid-Base Levels?Remember that the proximal tubule has carbonic anhydrase in its brush border which facilitates reabsorption of filtered bicarbonate.The proximal tubule then senses acidosis &#8594; retains bicarbonate.It also increases ammonia secretion, which traps the H+ that&#8217;s been secreted further down in the tubule.This is because excreted acid is in the urine as ammonium (NH4+).Also, recall that the &#945;-intercalated cells of the collecting duct secrete H+ driven by aldosterone.RememberExcreted acid appears in the urine as ammonium (NH4+).Loss of filtered bicarbonate is called proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), also called type II RTA.This makes sense, because bicarbonate reabsorption and loss occurs in the brush border of the proximal renal tubule.Why are the RTA numbers so weird? Because they were named in the order they were discovered! Also, Type III RTA doesn't exist &rarr; it was discovered, found to be wrong, and then thrown out!Failure to secrete H+ distally is called distal RTA.Remember that this is the role of the &#945;-intercalated cell, which also depends on the function of the principal cell.If it&#8217;s just a problem with the &#945;-intercalated cell, then the principal cell will be functioning normally, so there will be normal K+ excretion.This will be termed hypokalemic distal RTA &#8594; Type I RTA.If there&#8217;s a problem with aldosterone, then neither the principal cell nor the &#945;-intercalated cell will work properly (since the latter relies on the K+ export of the former).This causes hyperkalemic distal RTA &#8594; Type IV RTA.Type I RTA, where there&#8217;s a problem with the &#945;-intercalated cell only, is pretty rare! Generally, aldosterone problems are more common.Renal Tubular Acidosis TypesProximal Renal Tubular AcidosisExcess bicarbonate excretion from the proximal convoluted tubule.This is Type II RTA.Distal Renal Tubule AcidosisType I RTA &#8594; also known as hypokalemic distal RTA.A problem with the &#945;-intercalated cell only &#8594; spares the function of the principal cell, leading to normal potassium excretion.Type IV RTA &#8594; also known as hyperkalemic distal RTA.A problem with aldosterone, which affects both the principal cell and the &#945;-intercalated cell. This affects K+ excretion, leading to hyperkalemia.RememberType I = hypokalemic distal RTA = &#945;-intercalated cell only.Type II = proximal RTA = proximal tubular cells.Type III = doesn&#8217;t exist.Type IV = hyperkalemic distal RTA = principal cell and &#945;-intercalated cells.Bicarbonate AbsorptionRemember we saw carbonic anhydrase function in the conversion of bicarbonate in RBCs in the Gas Transport &amp; Diffusion lecture!Carbonic anhydrase in the brush border converts the HCO3 into H2O and CO2, which can then diffuse into the proximal tubular cell.$$HCO_3^- + H^+ \rightarrow H_2CO_3 \rightarrow H_2O + CO_2$$To get the bicarbonate from the proximal tubular cell into the blood, the reverse reaction happens.Carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubular cell converts the H2O and CO2 into HCO3, which can then get symported into the blood.$$H_2O + CO_2 \rightarrow H_2CO_3 \rightarrow HCO_3^- + H^+$$As a result, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, cause sodium bicarbonate loss, because they block re-absorption of bicarbonate from the proximal convoluted tubule.One example of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is Acetazolamide.It&#8217;s used to deal with altitude sickness, by causing a metabolic acidosis which would lead to a respiratory alkalosis.This would cause the body to naturally hyperventilate, which would prepare people when they would climb mountains.Again, not to be confused with Fanconi Anemia, which we saw in Blood. They just happened to be named after the same guy.RememberFanconi&#8217;s Syndrome = spectrum of symptoms associated with proximal tubular cell disorders.Renal Tubular AcidosisGlucosuria, phosphaturia, aminoaciduriaRememberCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors lead to bicarbonate loss at the proximal convoluted tubule.One example is Acetazolamide.Acid-Base Compensatory Responses1. Metabolic AcidosisIn metabolic acidosis, acid gain or bicarbonate loss should result in a 1:1 equivalent reduction in PCO2, called compensatory respiratory alkalosis.Why is it a complete match? Because you can always breathe more heavily! So this compensatory response is swift and complete.So if you &#8595;HCO3 by 10 &#8594; &#8595;PCO2 by 10.Note that a breathing pattern that increases both the rate and depth of breathing is called Kussmaul Respiration.Metabolic AcidosisWith metabolic acidosis, there is a 1:1 reduction.Memory Tip &#8594; you can always breathe faster.2. Metabolic AlkalosisIn metabolic acidosis, the increase in bicarbonate should result in an increase in PCO2, called compensatory respiratory acidosis, but it is not quite equivalent &#8594; there&#8217;s a 10:7 ratio.Why is this not quite equivalent? Although you can theoretically always breathe slower, this is limited by your oxygen demand.So if you &#8593;HCO3 by 10 &#8594; &#8593;PCO2 by 7.Metabolic AlkalosisWith metabolic alkalosis, there is a 10:7 ratio.Memory Tip &#8594; you can breathe a bit slower, but this is limited by your need for oxygen, so it&#8217;s not quite 1:1.3. Respiratory AcidosisIn respiratory acidosis, there is an acute response (hours), where the cells act as a buffer to control the acidosis to a small extent, about 10:1.So short term, you have a trivial cell buffering effect.So if you &#8593;PCO2 by 10 &#8594; &#8593;HCO3 by 1.There is also a chronic response (days), which is mediated by an increase in renal acid secretion, which is stronger than cell buffering &#8594; 10:4.This is 4 times stronger than the cell-buffering effect!So if you &#8593;PCO2 by 10 &#8594; &#8593;HCO3 by 4.Respiratory AcidosisWith respiratory acidosis there is both an acute and chronic response.Acutely, there will be a 10:1 ratio.Memory Tip &#8594; Cell buffering is weak.Chronically, there will be a 10:4 ratio.Memory Tip &#8594; renal buffering is 4&#215; stronger than cell buffering.4. Respiratory AlkalosisSimilarly, in respiratory alkalosis, there is an acute response (hours), where the cells can shift their buffers back to the ICF, which is an approximately 10:2 response.Just as before, the effect of the cell buffer shift is pretty trivial.So if you &#8595;PCO2 by 10 &#8594; &#8595;HCO3 by 2.The chronic response (days), functions to the same degree as with respiratory acidosis (10:4), and works by preserving renal acids and reducing bicarbonate loss.This renal response is twice as strong as the cellular response, and the ratio is the same as with respiratory alkalosis.So if you &#8595; PCO2 by 10 &#8594; &#8595;HCO3 by 4.Chronic respiratory alkalosis is pretty rare &#8594; patients won&#8217;t chronically hyperventilate.One exception for this is when you&#8217;re pregnant &#8594; then you&#8217;re minute ventilation increases physiologically, and you have a slight respiratory alkalosis.Respiratory AlkalosisWith respiratory alkalosis there is both an acute and chronic response.Acutely, there will be a 10:2 ratio.Memory Tip &#8594; Cell shift is small.Chronically, there will be a 10:4 ratio.Memory Tip &#8594; renal response is 2&#215; stronger than with cells. The ratio is the same as with respiratory acidosis.Summary of Compensatory ResponsesMetabolic Acidosis &#8594; 10:10 ratio.Metabolic Alkalosis &#8594; 10:7 ratio.Respiratory AcidosisAcute &#8594; 10:1 ratio.Chronic &#8594; 10:4 ratio.Respiratory AlkalosisAcute &#8594; 10:2 ratio.Chronic &#8594; 10:4 ratio.Acid-Base DisordersWith an acid-base disorder, there is typically a primary disorder, folloved by a compensatory response.Occasionally, two or more disorders may exist.Some examples include:Metabolic acidosis superimposed on metabolic alkalosis, leading to a &#8216;normal&#8217; pH and HCO3, but with an elevated anion gap.Salicyate Poisoning (ASA toxicity), leading to metabolic acidosis, and a overcompensatory respiratory alkalosis. This leads to an alkalemic pH.Why does an ASA overdose cause overcompensation?ASA gives you a metabolic acidosis by uncoupling oxidative respiration, resulting in lactic acidosis.However, it also affects the respiratory centre in the brain, causing it to overcompensate.This causes a stronger respiratory response than expected, leading to an alkalemic pH.This is one of the rare cases where the primary response is weaker than the compensation.RememberThis will be on the exam!ASA toxicity causes a primary lactic acidosis, and then a overcompensatory respiratory alkalosis because of effects on the respiratory centre of the brain.Metabolic AcidosisAnion Gap Metabolic AcidosisAlso known as AGMA.This is where the anion gap is higher than expected.This is due to an increase in H+ coupled with an increase in an unmeasured anion, that&#8217;s leading to the increase in the anion gap.Examples of unmeasured anions include lactate, ketoacids, salicyates, ethylene glycol, or methanol metabolites.It can me remembered with the MUDPILES acronym:MUDPILES AcronymThe differential diagosis for an AGMA is:M &#8594; Methanol.U &#8594; Uremia.D &#8594; Diabetic PKA.P &#8594; Phenformin (Replaced with Metformin).I &#8594; Iron poisoning.L &#8594; Lactic Acidosis.E &#8594; Ethylene Glycol.S &#8594; Salicylate Poisoning or Starvation Ketoacidosis.If you find a wide AG, you must find its source.The reason it's 2Na + Glucose + BUN, is because the Na is the predominant cation in the blood, and the number of anions in the urine should match! So instead of using all those, we just multiply the Na by two!One way is to measure the osmolality and compare it with the expected osmolality, \(\text{Osm} = 2 \times Na + \text{urea} + \text{glucose}\).An increase in this gap is suggestive of toxic alcohols &#8594; methanol, ethylene glycol.	The Expected Osmolarity	$$\text{Osm} = 2 \times Na + \text{urea} + \text{glucose}$$			Can be remembered as two salts plus a sugar bun.		An bigger osmolal gap than expected is suggestive of methanol or ethylene glycol	Non Anion Gap Metabolic AcidosisAlso known as N.This is when the anion gap is not wider than expected, and we have a metabolic acidosis.In this case, it&#8217;s not because of the presence of some hidden anions, it would just be due to less bicarbonate or more H+.Bicarbonate Loss:Loss from the proximal tubule (Type II RTA).GI tract losses (diarrhea).Failure to secrete H+Problem with the &#945;-intercalated cell (Type I RTA).Problem with aldosterone affecting both the &#945;-intercalated cell and the principal cell (Type IV RTA).To diagnose N, you have to take a history.Focus on diarrhea, drugs such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (Acetazolamide), aldosterone inhibitors or K-sparing diuretics.ACEI, ARBs, Heparin, etc, can also affect the RAAS, affecting aldosterone release.Examine the urine net charge (the urine anion gap), and the urine pH.If urine [Na+] + [K+] is much less than urine [Cl-], then this implies that there is significant urinary [NH4+] and the distal nephron is doing its jobIf urine pH is &#60;5.5, this implies that distal nephron is maximally acidifying the urineUrine Anion Gap/Net ChargeIf Cl &#62;&#62; Na + K, then this implies that NH4 is present.This means that H+ is properly being excreted from the &#945;-intercalated cells.This suggests that it&#8217;s not a failure to secrete H+ &#8594; it&#8217;s more likely to be due to bicarbonate loss (proximal tubule, GI problems).If Cl &leq; Na + K, then this implies that NH4 is absent.This means that the distal tubule isn&#8217;t properly acidifying the urine.This suggests that it&#8217;s more likely to be a failure to secrete H+, and not a problem of bicarbonate loss.This is because the &#8216;hidden&#8217; cation that makes up the difference is the ammonium!This would be simpler if we could measure the urine ammonium.But unfortunately, ammonium dissociates rapidly, so it&#8217;s extremely difficult to measure.As a consequence, we have to measure ammonium indirectly using the anion gap!CaveatNote that we assume that Na, Cl, K, and NH4 are the only ions in the urine.In cases where there are other anions, we may have an artificially low anion gap, because there are other unmeasured anions that are not contributing.This would make it look as if there&#8217;s not enough NH4, making it look like a failure to secrete H+.Some examples include sulfates, hippurate, bicarbonate, and ketoacids.RememberN can be due to:Bicarbonate Loss.Failure to Secrete H+.The urine anion gap or the net charge helps us differentiate between them.If Cl &#62;&#62; Na + K, then it&#8217;s more likely to be bicarbonate loss, because there&#8217;s plenty of H+ in the urine.If Cl &leq; Na + K, then it&#8217;s more likely to be a failure to secrete H+, because there isn&#8217;t much H+ in the urine.Treatment of AcidosisTreat the Underlying CauseMethanol and ethylene glycol can be treated with fomepizole or IV ethanol.These outcompete them for binding to alcohol dehydrogenase.Hemodialysis is often required to remove the toxic metabolites.Treating Methanol/Ethylene Glycol PoisoningFomepizole &#8594; used now instead of IV ethanol as a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase!IV ethanol &#8594; now replaced with fomepizole because fomepizole doesn&#8217;t make patients drunk (damn). Still used when fomepizole is unavailable.Hemodialysis &#8594; remove the toxin quickly because metabolism of the toxic metabolites takes a while.Remember that providing buffer (sodium bicarbonate) generates more CO2 and if the patient can&#8217;t breathe properly, they will retain CO2 and potentially worsen intracellular acidosis.Don&#8217;t give IV bicarbonate to patients that can&#8217;t breathe properly!Also remember that sodium bicarbonate contains sodium. This goes straight to the ECF, pulling water into the ECF.This may be a problem in critically ill patients with ECF volume overload, poor cardiac function, etc.So don&#8217;t give IV bicarbonate in patients with ECF overload.RememberDon&#8217;t give sodium bicarbonate to patients who:Can&#8217;t breathe &#8594; can&#8217;t get rid of CO2.Have ECF Overload. &#8594; can&#8217;t handle volume overload.However, if you have a bicarbonate in the single digits, you&#8217;re at a high risk for having a rapid drop in pH, so you should give it anyway!However, when the pH &#60; 7.10 or the HCO3 &#60; 10-12 mmol/L, you&#8217;re at the point where a further drop in HCO3 or a rise in PCO2 will lead to a rapid drop in pH.At this point, bicarbonate is indicated.So if you see a bicarbonate in the single digits, you would err towards giving it, even with the above caveats.Metabolic AlkalosisMetabolic alkalosis is typically not a disease by itself. It&#8217;s usually caused by too much mineralicorticoid activity &#8594; typically too much aldosterone.This can be primary, as with Conn&#8217;s syndrome, adrenal hyperplasia, reninoma (tumour producing renin), etc.This can also be secondary, associated with ECF volume contraction and stimulation of RAAS, or with diuretics, vomiting, or Bartter&#8217;s/Gitelman&#8217;s.Urine lytes are helpful:Urine [Cl-] &#60; 10, suggests a secondary cause (unless on diuretics).If you&#8217;re vomiting and you&#8217;re alkalotic, your body tries to get rid of the bicarbonate, and it brings sodium with it.So when you&#8217;re volume depleted, and you have metabolic alkalosis, usually the urine calcium will be a better indicator than the urine sodium of volume contraction.High urine [K+], confirms that aldosterone is working.Often associated with hypokalemia, because excess aldosterone function will increase K+ out, leading to potassium wasting.RememberLow Urine Cl is better than urine Na when looking at volume contraction with metabolic alkalosis.High Urine K confirms the action of aldosterone.Treatment of AlkalosisTreat the underlying cause.If it&#8217;s primary hyperaldosteronism, then you&#8217;d give an aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone.If you are volume contracted, trigging the RAAS response which jacks up aldosterone activity, then give isotonic saline!ComplicationIf you have ongoing low potassium, because of the action of aldosterone, this can actually trick the kidney into thinking that you&#8217;re acidotic, and not alkalotic.This is because K+ and H+ can exchange for one another in the proximal tubular cell.So when you&#8217;re hypokalemic, K+ exchanges for H+, causing the proximal tubular cell thinks you&#8217;re acidotic.This means that you need to replace the K as well, and not just replace the volume!RememberIf you&#8217;re volume depleted, you have to correct the low K as well as correcting the volume, to fix the abnormal kidney response (It thinks that you&#8217;re acidotic and not alkalotic).SummaryExamine the pH to determine if it&#8217;s acidosis or alkalosis.If the pH is low (&#60;7.35), then is this primary metabolic acidosis or respiratory acidosis.If the pH is high (&#62;7.45), then is this primary metabolic aklalosis of respiratory alkalosis.Determine the compensation. Is it acute or chronic? Is it sufficient? Is there a mixed disorder? (eg. with ASA toxicity).Examine the anion gap, and compare it to what&#8217;s expected, factoring in albumin.If metabolic acidosis, determine if it&#8217;s AGMA or N.If AGMA, look at the osmolal gap. If elevated, consider Methanol/Ethylene glycol poisoning.If N, either consider bicarbonate loss or a failure to excrete H+.If it&#8217;s alkalosis, is the ECF expanded (primary mineralicorticoid problem), or contracted (secondary mineralicorticoid problem).", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/11/acid-base-physiology.html"},
	{"title": "Hyponatremia", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesDescribe the pathophysiology of hypernatremia, and list the main causes and differential diagnoses.Describe the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, and list the main causes and differential diagnoses.House&#8217;s LawDon&#8217;t forget that:Disorders of serum sodium are actually water handling problems.Disorders of ECF volume are actually sodium handling problems.So of course, these are the water handling problems.HyponatremiaThis is where there&#8217;s too much water relative to sodium, which can lead to dangerous brain swelling.It&#8217;s defined as plasma [Na] &#60; 136 mmol/L.RememberHyponatremia &#8594; [Na] &#60; 136 mmol/L.Depending on if it&#8217;s acute or chronic, we can have different symptoms:If it&#8217;s acute, brain cells can&#8217;t compensate, so we may have headache, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, disorientation, and seizures.It&#8217;s critical to know if this is &#8216;true&#8217; hyponatremia &#8594; the plasma osmolality should be low!This is because the [Na] dilution could be because of the presence of other osmoles.It may not be a water handling problem &#8594; it might just be that there&#8217;s another osmotically active component that&#8217;s pulling water into the ECF!Normally, Na is the most osmotically active component, but in some cases, something else may be!The canonical example is with severe diabetes &#8594; the high glucose concentration draws water into the ECF, diluting the Na, causing hyponatremia.Pseudohyponatremia &#8594; hyponatremia that&#8217;s not due to a water handling problem. It&#8217;s often due to the presence of another osmotically active solute.How can you differentiate hyperglycemia from true hyponatremia?As mentioned before, the plasma osmolality should be low with true hyponatremia (since there&#8217;s a problem with water handling).This means that the water will go into the ICF &#8594; cells will swell.With hyperglycemia, the plasma osmolality is high, pulling water from the ICF into the ECF &#8594; cells will shrivel.RememberBoth hyperglycemia and &#8220;true&#8221; hyponatremia (due to water handling problems), can present with a low [Na]. To differentiate them:With true hyponatremia, the plasma osmolality is low &#8594; cells swell.With hyperglycemia, the plasma osmolality is high &#8594; cells shrivel. This is pseudohyponatremia!So when you look at the [Na], you actually have to correct for the [Glucose]!For every 3-4 mmol above normal (say 3.5) for the glucose, you &#8216;correct&#8217; the [Na] by 1 mmol/L.For instance, if [Na] = 125, [Glucose] = 35 over normal, then the &#8216;true&#8217; [Na] = 135 mmol/L.Fudge factors are sort of iffy &#8594; it&#8217;s better to just measure the patients osmolality!Older lab techniques can also be confused whe assessing [Na] when there&#8217;s a lot of lipid of protein in the sample, leading to a falsely low Na. In this case, the plasma osmolality should be normal.This could be seen in patients with genetic diseases causing hypertriglyceridemia, or diseases that cause excess IgG production, for instance.RememberWhen you see hyponatremia, always check the osmolality to ensure that it&#8217;s also low!If the osmolality is normal or high, then this is pseudohyponatremia.Causes of True HyponatremiaGenerally because you can&#8217;t secrete H2O from the kidneys &#8594; preserving water.Most often, this is because ADH is inappropriately elevated.Normally, ADH regulates osmolarity, to prevent swelling or shrivelling of ICF cells. When this control is dysregulated, then bad things can happen.Assessment needs to focus on why the kidneys are not excreting water:Is the GFR/urine production adequate?Are tubules sufficiently extracting solute from the urine.Is there no ADH, so water can stay in the urine and not in the body?Non-osmotic Stimuli for ADHDecreased effective circulating volume.Remember that Angiotensin II (from the RAAS system), can increase the release of ADH.As mentioned above however, this stimulus is usually weaker than with an osmotic stimulus.When you&#8217;re severely volume depleted however, this becomes the dominant signal!Pain, emotion, and stress post-op.Endocrine disorders (thyroid, adrenal insufficiency).Tumors or infections (CNS, lung) &#8594; lung cancer is a common one.DrugsChlorpropamide.Clofibrate.Phenothiazine.Cyclophosphamide.Carbamazepine.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, a class of antidepressants).Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, commonly called Ecstasy).Desmopressin (ddAVP) or Oxytocin. &#8594; Oxytocin is structurally very similar to ADH!SSRIs are the common ones now because there are a lot of elderly patients on them with depression.Clinical Assessment of HyponatremiaSummaryCheck Plasma Osmolality:If it&#8217;s normal or high, then this is pseudohyponatremia &#8594; could be glucose (diabetic), a faulty lab test because of high protein/lipid, etc.If it&#8217;s low, then this is true hyponatremia.If it&#8217;s true hyponatremia, check if ADH is present or absent by looking at the urine osmolality.If the urine osmolality is high (&#62;100 mOsm/L), then there&#8217;s too much ADH.If the patient has true hyponatremia, then they would want to be keeping ions in to increase the plasma osmolality.The hypothalamus would detect the plasma osmolality was low, and reduce posterior pituitary ADH production.If the urine osmolality is low (&#60;100 mOsm/L), then ADH is absent, which is expected.Then this is probably due to excess intake &#8594; excess water ingestion or iatrogenic causes.You would fluid restrict in this case.If the urine isn&#8217;t maximally dilute, then you assess [Na].If the [Na] &#60; 20, then the body is conserving sodium. This is suggestive of volume contraction.If the [Na] &#62; 20, then the body isn&#8217;t acting like it&#8217;s volume contracted. Then we consider if the hyponatremia is due to impaired water loss from the kidneys.If the [Na] &#60; 20, then we look at the ECF volume to determine if it&#8217;s true volume contraction or not.If it&#8217;s true volume contraction (ECF contracted), then there must be some sort of non-renal fluid loss, and the kidney is compensating by conserving Na.If it&#8217;s not, (ECF expanded), then the body must think that it&#8217;s volume contracted.This was seen with CHF, cirrhosis, and renal artery stenosis.So in this case, the water handling problem is that the body thinks that it&#8217;s volume contracted but it really isn&#8217;t, causing more Na retention.If the [Na] &#62; 20, then we look at the renal function (GFR), to see if we have impaired water loss from the kidney.Since it&#8217;s not an intake problem (the urine isn&#8217;t maximally dilute), then now we consider an export problem.If the GFR is very low, then this is suggestive of renal failure (acute or chronic).Here, the kidney isn&#8217;t functioning properly, preventing it from effectively secreting H2O.This would be the opposite of say, a nephrogenic DI. With a nephrogenic DI, then the body can&#8217;t retain water. Here, we can&#8217;t get rid of it!If the GFR is low or normal.Then it&#8217;s probably not a problem with renal function.Then we would consider problems with regulation, like diuretics, endocrine probolems, or mineralicorticoid deficiencies.If all you know is that the plasma osmolality is low and that the urine osmolality isn&#8217;t maximally dilute, then this is an ADH problem.If the urine sodium is low, then you know that the RAAS response is overriding the osmolality response here, and this is usually due to volume contraction.Could be false volume contraction &#8594; CHF triggering ADH.Could be true volume contraction &#8594; acute volume loss triggering ADH.If the urine sodium isn&#8217;t low, it has to be something else triggering ADH (inappropriate regulation), or something affecting kidney function (dysfunctional export).We can rule in/rule out renal dysfunction by measuring GFR.Otherwise, there&#8217;s something dysregulating ADH! - Drugs like SSRIs, Ecstasy, or Oxytocin could be doing this.What if we had that:The plasma osmolality is low &#8594; true hyponatremiaThe urine isn&#8217;t maximally dilute &#8594; not excess intakeThe urine [Na] isn&#8217;t low (&#60; 20 mmol/L) &#8594; not volume contracted.The GFR is normal &#8594; not kidney dysfunction?Then we look at the ECF volume.If the ECF is expanded, then it&#8217;ll look just like the false volume contracted patient.The only difference is they&#8217;re on diuretics, that block the RAAS response.This makes them a little harder to diagnose.If the ECF is contracted, then it would be the elderly patient that kept taking diuretics even when they were volume contracted.Again, the urine sodium wasn&#8217;t a convenient clue because we don&#8217;t have RAAS activation leading to Na conservation.They&#8217;re still ECF contracted, just with a blocked RAAS response.Note that the patients with a normal/high urine [Na] are the same as these ones with a low urine [Na], except that they&#8217;re on diuretics which block the normal Na conserving response!You really have to take a history here!It gets really hard when (5), the ECF volume is normal however.Then it isn&#8217;t a blocked RAAS response due to diuretics, because RAAS wouldn&#8217;t be active normally unless there was false/true volume contraction.This is where you would do the CAT scan of the head/chest, check the thyroid and adrenal function, and carefully do a medication Hx &#8594; it must be some type of ADH regulation problem!This category would be the I have no idea what&#8217;s going on category!Correction of Water ExcessFluid Restriction &#8594; no oral fluids, N/G feeds, hypotonic IV fluids.If there are symptoms (seizures), correct rapidly with hypertonic saline (3% NaCl).You gotta stop the brain swelling!Most seizures will stop within 3-7 mmol of correction of plasma [Na].Once the symptoms improve, slow the rate of correction to a max of 10 mmol/day. (The same as with hypernatremia)!RememberJust like with hypernatremia, correct hyponatremia at a rate of &#60; 10 mmol/day.If asymptomatic, this is a chronic hyponatremia, where the body had time to adapt.In these cases, fluid restrict and go slow.If you don&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll have a horrible complication called osmotic demyelination &#8594; it even sounds horrible!These people end up quadraplegic because the rapid osmotic shift causes the nerves to be demyelinated.Determine the underlying cause of the abnormal ADH secretion and correct if possible (e.g. stop offending drugs, correct ECF volume contraction, treat heart failure, etc).If it&#8217;s truly SIADH (rare), then you may need demeclocycline or a vaptan.SIADH = Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone secretion. It&#8217;s often caused by a tumour that sends signals to the brain to produce ADH.In this case, you may need something to inhibit the action of ADH.Demclocycline is no longer being made &#8594; can&#8217;t use it anymore.New drugs would be the vaptans. These are expensive, so this would be a short term choice.As mentioned before, Vaptans cause nephrogenic DI, because they block sensitivity to ADH.If using IV fluids, remember to compare what is going in with what is coming out!.In the case of hyponatremia, you want the osmolality of what&#8217;s going in to be higher than what&#8217;s going out.If you have urine coming out that has an osm of 400, and you&#8217;re running an IV of normal saline that has an osmolality of 300, then you&#8217;re actually diluting the patients fluid!This will make the situation worse!This may sound super obvious, but if you&#8217;re not careful, it&#8217;s an easy mistake to make:ExampleMr. X has a brain tumor and SIADH with [Na] = 120 mmol/L, POsm = 270, urine Osm = 600 mOsm/L.[Na] &#60; 136 mmol/L &#8594; hyponatremia.Plasma osmolality truly low &#8594; not pseudohyponatremia.Urine osmolality &#62; 100 mOsm/L &#8594; not excess water intake.Here the patient has a ton of ADH being produced by the tumour (SIADH), causing H2O retention.Dr. IQ reasons that IV normal saline (0.9% NaCl, Na = 154, Osm &approx; 300) is &#8220;hypertonic to the blood, so that should fix him&#8221;, and infuses 1.0 litre.Mr. X is euvolemic, so volume receptors see ~300 mOsm of solute and try to excrete it.The patient was at a happy volume, so when 300 mOsm comes in, the body tries to get 300 mOsm to come out.Stretch receptors cause natriuretic peptide release.These inhibit the passive sodium channels in the principal cells of the collecting duct.Because of ADH, urine is concentrated.The IV had 300 mOsm of solute, but the urine has an osmolality of 600 mOsm/L. This means that this is equivalent to 0.5 L of urine.But Dr. IQ gave him 300 mOsm of solute in 1.0 L of fluid.This causes a net gain of 0.5 L of free water, and the sodium falls further, causing seizures &#8594; whoops.Remember, compare what is going in with what is coming out to see the net effect.Dr. IQ should have restricted water access and considered hypertonic saline (3% NaCl, Na = 500, Osm &approx; 1000).RememberDon&#8217;t look at the plasma osmolality when determining the IV osmolality. Look at the urine osmolality!Always compare out to in!Avoid Rapidly Correcting HyponatremiaJust like with hypernatremia, you don&#8217;t want to correct hyponatremia too quickly, because the cells will have adapted by losing osmolytes.If you give hypertonic fluid too quickly, water will immediately be pulled out of the brain cells, causing osmotic demyelination &#8594; quadraplegic, and you&#8217;re in deep shit.As with hypernatremia, you want to correct things slowly, at a rate of &#60; 10 mmol/L a day.SummaryHyponatremia is almost always a problem of free water excess and too much ADH.In order to treat hyponatremia, you need to understand why the kidneys are not excreting a dilute urine (consider the GFR, tubule function, cause of ADH).Treatment of hyponatremia involves identifying and correcting underlying causes, restricting access to free water, and in some cases (when symptomatic), proving IV fluids that are hypertonic to the urine (not the plasma)!If symptomatic, treat the first 3-7 mmol/L quickly and then slow the rate to &#60; 10 mmol/day.Hyponatremia Case ExampleCase Summary82 y/o woman with dementia, mild hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.She is admitted to the psychiatry ward for her depression and is noted to be hyponatremic with a serum sodium of 118 for the last 4 days (chronic).She is taking Paxil for depression, Adalat (Nifedipine) for blood pressure, diet for diabetes, and she is not on any diuretics.Physical ExaminationHR = 70 beats/minute.Blood pressure 130/80.The rest of the exam was normalFrom this, the patient&#8217;s ECF volume is probably normal &#8594; normal salt handling.This means that her total body sodium is normal!Remember that total body sodium &neq; serum sodium concentration.No marked BP increase, or symptoms of volume overload or volume contraction.ElectrolytesNa = 115 mmol/L (low)K = 5.0 mmol/L (normal)Cl = 83.0 mmol/LHCO3 = 25 mmol/L (normal)Blood urea nitrogen = 5mmol/L (normal)Creatinine 60 umol/L (normal)The BUN and Creatinine are normal &#8594; this is suggestive of normal kidney function.This suggests that the GFR is normal!What do you need to know next?Look at the plasma osmolality to determine if this is pseudohyponatremia or true hyponatremia.This is especially important in this case, because the patient is diabetic, and may have pseudohyponatremia due to excess blood glucose drawing water in.You would also look at urine osmolality and urine sodium.If the osmolality is very low, this is suggestive of excess water intake.If not, but the urine sodium is very low, this is suggestive of volume depletion leading to Na conservation.Additional InformationBlood glucose is normal (5 mmol/L)Serum osmolality = 245 mosm/kg.Urine osmolality = 383 mosm/kg.Urine sodium = 80 mmol/L.Urine potassium = 80 mmol/L.What would you like to know now?The urine osmolality isn&#8217;t extremely low &#8594; not an intake problem. Suggestive of abnormal ADH release.The urine sodium isn&#8217;t &#60; 20 mmol/L &#8594; this suggests that the patient isn&#8217;t experiencing true or false volume contraction.Since the BUN and creatinine are within normal ranges, this probably isn&#8217;t renal dysfunction.In this case, you would look at the ECF volume, to determine if it&#8217;s true volume contraction or false volume contraction that is disguised by an abnormal RAAS response.Remember that normal RAAS activation would conserve plasma [Na], resulting in a low urine [Na].But this may not be the case if there&#8217;s something affecting RAAS. (An ACEI, diuretics, etc).Additional InformationThe patient is clinically euvolemic and apart from her depression is otherwise feeling wellWhat is the diagnosis?After making sure the renal, adrenal, and thryoid axis is intact, we can safely say that the diagnosis is SIADH (inappropriate ADH release).This is especially since the patient is not on a diuretic, so it&#8217;s less likely that this is an affected RAAS response.The treatment would be to treat the underlying cause which in this case may be the anti-depressant (remember that SSRIs can stimulate ADH release).However, you need to rule out other causes.Free water restriction to correct serum sodium by no more than 10 mmol/day.What if the patient was comatose?If comatose, hypertonic saline, to correct the plasma [Na] by 3-7 mmol/L.Don&#8217;t forget to compare what goes in to what goes out, and not to the plasma osmolality!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/10/hyponatremia.html"},

It&#8217;s a measurement of concentration, not total sodium!Most often a result of a lack of free water.Sometimes occurs because of an actual gain in total sodium (drinking sea water, or iatrogenic IV fluids).This causes water to be drawn out of the ICF, so cells shrink and fail to function properly.Symptoms include altered mental status, twitching, seizures, and coma (doesn&#8217;t sound good).Severe hypernatremia can shrink cerebral cells enough that they pull the dura enough to cause cerebral vessel rupture!Hypernatremia is typically unusual in an outpatient setting because our thirst response is usually so strong &#8594; it&#8217;s difficult to &#8216;not know&#8217; that you don&#8217;t have enough free water.Usually happens when the patient is debilitated and can&#8217;t ask for water.Or when there isn&#8217;t any water to be found anywhere (in the middle of the desert).RememberHypernatremia &#8594; [Na] &#62; 144 mmol/L.Diabetes Insipidus (DI)Diabainein &#8594; Greek, &#8220;to pass through&#8221;.Insipidus &#8594; Latin, &#8220;having no flavour&#8221;.So Diabetes insipidus is where you pass large amounts of urine, that&#8217;s tasteless (polyuria).It&#8217;s also associated with increased thirst and drinking (polydipsia).RememberThe hallmark symptoms of diabetes insipidus are:Polyuria &#8594; large amounts of dilute urine.Polydipsia &#8594; increased thirst and drinking.Subtypes of Diabetes Insipidus include:Central DI &#8594; inadequate central production of ADH.Nephrogenic DI &#8594; inadequate renal respnse to ADH.Psychogenic/Dipsogenic DI &#8594; primary neurological disorders of thirst, causing you to compulsively drink too much water.Note that central DI and nephrogenic DI will cause hypernatremia, because we can&#8217;t open the aquaporins in the collecting duct, preventing us from re-absorbing water, in response to fluid loss.Howver, psychogenic DI won&#8217;t cause hypernatremia &#8594; it can actually cause hyponatremia if you intake more water than the kidneys can filter out!RememberDiabetes insipidus can be classified into:Central Diabetes Insipidus &#8594; brain doesn&#8217;t make ADH.Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus &#8594; kidneys don&#8217;t respond to ADH.Psychogenic/Dipsogenic DI &#8594; Compulsively drinking too much water.Central DI and Nephrogenic DI will cause hypernatremia, but psychogenic DI will not.Since they all have the same symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia), you have to rule out psychogenic DI before treatment!Causes of Central Diabetes InsipidusTrauma, especially basal skull fracture.Neurosurgery, especially near the pituitary.Space occupying lesions (tumors, sarcoidosis).Infections (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis).Hypoxic/anoxic brain damage.Idiopathic.Causes of Nephrogenic DICongenital nephrogenic DI.Kidneys are developmentally unable to respond to ADH.Drugs impairing ADH action.eg. Lithium, demeclocycline, &#8220;vaptans&#8221; (conivaptan, tolvaptan, satavaptan, lixivaptan).People with bipolar disorder will be on lithium, so they may develop progressive nephrogenic DI.Vaptans are a new class of drugs used to inhibit ADH, and make you pee out water.Electrolyte abnormalities.Hypokalemia, hypercalcemia.Conditions that impair the ability to concentrate the urine.Chronic kidney disease.Loop diuretics.Tubulointerstitial diseases.Obstruction.Clinical Assessment of HypernatremiaSummaryYour line of thinking should be &#8594; &#8216;why didn&#8217;t the patient just drink water to restore his osmolality?&#8217;If there&#8217;s high plasma sodium and you&#8217;re volume expanded, then you probably had a high intake of hypertonic solution &#8594; seawater, iatrogenic hypertonic IV fluids.If you&#8217;re not volume expanded, then look at the urine volume to make sure that it&#8217;s not all being peed out!If the urine volume is low, then the water losses must be non-renal.If the urine volume is high, then the water losses must be renal.If it&#8217;s a renal cause, we want to assess the urine osmolality:If the urine osmolality is low, then we have an abnormal ADH response.If the urine osmolality is high, then there&#8217;s an osmole that must be dragging out all the urine, even with the high [Na] in the body.If it&#8217;s high osmolality:It could be Na/K, this would be suggestive of a diuretic (loop, thiazide) or a renal insufficiency (Bartter, Gitelman), that would prevent Na reabsorption.If it&#8217;s not Na/K, then it could be glucose (in diabetics), or mannitol.If it&#8217;s low osmolality:Then we have polyuria &#8594; this would be one of the diabetes insipidus types.If you give the patient ADH, and their osmolality improves, this must be central DI (the body isn&#8217;t producing ADH, but it responds normally).If you give the patient ADH, and their osmolality doesn&#8217;t improve, then this must be nephrogenic DI (the body is producing ADH, but it doesn&#8217;t respond to it).Desmopressin (ddAVP) is basically IV ADH.Correction of [Na]Calculate the Free H2O Deficit &#8594; how much water do you have to give them?Intuitively, \(TBW_c \times [Na]_c = TBW_d \times [Na]_d\), since the moles of Na will stay constant when you dilute with water.TBW = total body water, &#8216;c&#8217; = current, and &#8216;d&#8217; = desired.Solving for \( \Delta = TBW_d - TBW_c \), which is the free water deficit, we obtain:	\begin{align}		TBW_d &amp;= \frac{TBW_c [Na_c]}{[Na]_d}\\		\Delta &amp;= TBW_c \left( \frac{[Na_c]}{[Na_d]} - 1 \right)	\end{align}For the \( TBW_c \), we use 50% of the body weight (versus 60% in the normal person) &#8594; this is because hypernatremia = less free water.For the \( [Na]_d \), we use 140 mmol/L, which is the normal Na concentration.Hence, the free H2O deficit is:	Free H2O Deficit	$$ \Delta = \frac{BW}{2} \times \left( \frac{[Na_c]}{140} - 1 \right) $$	Where BW is equal to the body weight of the patient.Insensible H2O losses are the losses you get from breathing and sweating, not from urine/GI loss. It's called insensible because we're usually unaware of it happening!Account for ongoing free H2O lossesUrine, GI losses.Insensible losses &approx; 800-1000 mL/day.A general ballpark for these insensible losses is around 1L/day.RememberInsensible H2O losses are around 1L/day.Correct the [ Na ] slowly &#8594; ~0.5 mmol/hour or maximum of 10 mmol/dayRememberCorrect hypernatremia at a rate of &#60; 10 mmol/day.Let the patient drink themselves, or use a nasogastric water tube if they can&#8217;t. We generally avoid using IV replenishment, because the only way to do so is with D5W!We add the dextrose to the water because otherwise you can cause bursting of cells local to the injection site because of the influx of hypotonic water. The dextrose is eventually metabolized, leaving the water. This gives the water time to distribute itself.D5W, is 5% dextrose in water, which presents some problems:IV D5W is limited to 300-350 mL/hour.Beyond this you can cause hyperglycemia, and osmotic diuresis (the sugar drags water out of the kidney).This actually makes things worse! We pull the water out again.To prevent this from happening always compare what is going in with what is coming out!If what&#8217;s going in is more watery than what&#8217;s going out, then the osmolality will fall.If what&#8217;s going in is less watery than what&#8217;s going out, then the osmolality will rise.RememberWith IV H2O replenishment, always compare the input osmolality and the output osmolality to ensure that we&#8217;re changing the plasma osmolality in the right direction!Avoid Rapidly Correcting HypernatremiaWe mentioned before that the maximum rate of [Na] correction is 10 mmol/L.Why is this the case?You don&#8217;t want cerebral edema to occur!With hypernatremia, ICF fluid is pulled out into the ECF. In the brain, this causes the cells to shrink.Brain cells actually rapidly adapt, and accumulate electrolytes with a high osmolality to maintain cell volume.If you suddenly give too much water, these high osmolality brain cells can suddenly engorge before they can correct their hypertonic state.This can cause cerebral edema!SummaryHypernatremia is almost always a problem of free water loss.Salt water ingestion and iatrogenic IV fluids were given as 2 exceptions.Hypernatremia is unusual except at extremes of age, or when access to water and the ability to drink are impaired.Diabetes insipidus may be a cause of hypernatremia due to lack of ADH (central DI), or inability to respond to ADH (nephrogenic DI).Treatment of hypernatremia involves identifying and correcting underlying cause, providing oral water where possible, and intravenous hypotonic fluids with a correction of &#60;10 mmol/d.Hypernatremia Case ExampleCase Summary86-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with decreased level of consciousness while waiting for a swallow evaluation as an outpatient.Family reports that the patient has baseline advanced dementia, which has been worsening over the last year. She is not verbal.She is on no medications and has no other medical problems.Physical ExaminationHR = 120 beats/minute.Blood Pressure = 90/60.Dry mucous membranes.JVP = flat.No peripheral edema.The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.PE findings of flat JVP, no edema, and dry mucous membranes is suggestive of volume contraction.Since she&#8217;s ECF volume contracted, this is a sodium disorder &#8594; total body sodium is low.But we don&#8217;t know if the patient has hypernatremia or hyponatremia &#8594; it really depends on how much water was added to dilute the salt!Remember that hypernatremia and hyponatremia are water handling problems!Lab InvestigationsNa = 160 mmol/L.K = 4.0 mmol/L.Cl = 117 mmol/L.HCO3 = 24 mmol/L.Blood urea nitrogen = 15 mmol/L.Creatinine = 90 umol/L.Urine TestsUrine [Na] = 15 mmol/L.Urine creatinine is 6.0 mmol/L.Urine osmolality = 600 mosm/kg.Clinically, Na &#62; 144 mmol/L, so this is hypernatremia.So not only does she not have much salt, but she also doesn&#8217;t have much water!Now, since the patient has hypernatremia, and is volume contracted, next we want to look at the urine volume to see if this has a renal cause or a non-renal cause.How do we look at urine values?Remember that we said that lab tests will often show the normal range of urine ions will be from 0-150 mmol/L &#8594; it can very significantly depending on the degree of dilution.So how do you know if the value is normal or abnormal?Think &#8220;If I was the kidney, in this situation, what would I want to do?&#8221;&#8221;In this case, since the patient is volume contracted, they would want to retain their Na, in order to maintain their fluid volume.So you should see a low urine [Na], which we do see.You would also expect a high urine osmolality, as you conserve fluid.Since these expectations corroborate the urine values, renal function seems normal.In this case, note that the patient has a high plasma sodium, but actually conserves Na to maintain fluid volume! It&#8217;s somewhat counterintuitive, but the body prioritizes volume over osmolality in dire situations?RememberAlways focus on volume contraction and volume overload as the primary problems that the kidney will respond to (via a change in ion/water flow).What is the most likely cause of the hypernatremia and how do you interpret the urine tests?The patient has hypernatremia and is volume contracted.There is high urine osmolality, which means that it probably isn&#8217;t diabetes insipidus, where the loss of volume is due to renal sources.Given the history, a reduced water intake is most likely.Most human beings would kill to get to the water tap when the serum sodium starts climbing above 143 mmol/L as the thirst mechanism is turned on to the maximum.The patient has advanced dementia and likely does not sense thirst. She also may not be able to physically get to water because of weakness and swallowing difficulties.She has hypernatremia because of a free water deficit related to poor intake of water.The Fractional Excretion of Sodium is easy to remember as Su/p over Cu/pSu/p is the sodium in the urine, divided by the sodium in the plasma.Cu/p is the creatinine in the urine, divided by the creatinine in the plasma.It&#8217;s a measure of the percentage of the sodium filtered by the kidney which is excreted in the urinelIf this is low, it means that the body is disproportionately conserving sodium in an attempt to conserve body volume.Creatinine is a waste product &#8594; it isn&#8217;t reabsorbed. This is why we use it as a measure of filtration.For a derivation, see Wikipedia.In this case, the fractional excretion of sodium is:Note that since creatinine is a waste product, its concentration in the blood is very low &rarr; it's in micromoles. But in the urine, the units are in millimoles! Always remember to convert!	\begin{align}		FE_{Na} &amp;= \frac{[Na]_u/[Na]_p}{[\text{Creat}]_u/[\text{Creat}]_p} \times 100\%\\		FE_{Na} &amp;= \frac{15/160}{6000/90} \times 100\%\\		FE_{Na} &amp;= \frac{15/160}{6000/90} \times 100\%\\		FE_{Na} &amp;= \frac{15/160}{6000/90} \times 100\%\\		FE_{Na} &amp;= 0.14\%	\end{align}The fractional excretion is typically less than 1% (we reclaim over 99% of our filtered sodium).In this case however, it&#8217;s &#60; 0.1% &#8594; this is suggestive of volume contraction!	Fractional Excretion of Sodium	$$FE_{Na} = \frac{[Na]_u/[Na]_p}{[\text{Creatinine}]_u/[\text{Creatinine}]_p} \times 100\%$$			Remember this as SU/P over CU/P		A low \( FE_{Na} \) suggests a severe volume contracted state.	How would you treat this patient?ECF Volume Contraction &#8594; isotonic fluid! (Remember the volume status lecture).Severe Water Deficit &#8594; give her water!Note that we deal with the volume status first, and then we deal with the hypernatremia/hyponatremia.It seems a little counterintuitive to give isotonic fluid, and then water, but we don&#8217;t want to potentially cause flooding into the ICF!Assuming this patient weighs 50 kg, how would you replace her free water deficit?Using our equation for the free water deficit, we need:$$ \Delta = \frac{50}{2} \times \left( \frac{160}{140} - 1 \right) = 3.6 L$$Therefore, the patient&#8217;s water deficit is 3.6 L.Now, for IV correction, since you want to correct the hypernatremia at no faster than 10 mmol/day, what rate would we need to replace the free water at?Her current [Na] is 160 mmol/L.The desired [Na] is 140 mmol/L.The difference is 20, so if we want to correct it at a rate of 10 mmol/day, we would do it over 2 days.Since the water deficit is 3.6 L, this is 1.8 L/day.So you&#8217;d give IV D5W 1.8 L over 24 hours&#8594; IV D5W at 75 cc/hour, or free water through an NG tube at 75 cc/hour.Continue for 48 hours.This does not account for free water loss from urine, GI tract, and insensible losses. In her case, since she&#8217;s volume depleted, this would be small.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/10/hypernatremia.html"},
	{"title": "Free Water Handling in the Kidney", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesYou should be able to describe how the collecting tubule, in the presence or absence of antidiuretic hormone, plays a key role in handling of free water.You should be able to describe the mechanism of action of ADH and list factors that promote or inhibit its release.Why is Water so Important?Intracellular volume is important for maintenance of cell function.Cell swelling (expanded ICF volume) is particularly dangerous since some cells, such as the brain, are enclosed in a tight space with little room for expansion (i.e. the skull).Rapid changes in cell size may cause permanent dysfunction! That&#8217;s not good!ExampleNote that we&#8217;re dealing with the ICF now, not the ECF!Remember that fluid distribution between the ICF and ECF is dictated by osmolality!So if we give this patient 3.6 L of water, since it&#8217;s hypotonic to the ICF, it will distribute into the ICF.To maintain osmolality, this will follow the 2/3 ICF, 1/3 ECF ratio we discussed previously.Fluid distribution within the ECF compartments will roughly follow the 3:1 interstitium:intravascular ratio we discussed previously.So of the 3.6 L:2.4 goes into the ICF.1.2 goes into the ECF.0.9 goes into the interstitium.0.3 goes into the intravascular space.Note that in this case, the patient drank a ton of water, but his intravascular volume didn&#8217;t increase by much!So when you drink water, it doesn&#8217;t go into the vessels! Fluid distributes depending on osmolality!If you want stuff to go into the ECF, you want salt.If you want stuff to go into the ICF, you want water.Water HandlingApproximately 180L of water is filtered through the glomerulus each day, but the daily urine volume is only 1L &#8594; most of our filtered water has to be reabsorbed.Water handling is usually independent of other kidney functions.So water handling would be done independent of sodium handling, acid-base handling, or potassium handling.Because of this, the kidneys are able to modulate the volume of water secreted without affecting the amount of solute secreted.This also means that interpreting the urine concentration of solutes must be done while considering dilution/concentration by water!The normal concentrations for urine can vary significantly, depending on how much water is in there!That&#8217;s why urine ion concentrations will have such wide normal ranges on a lab test.Antidiuretic HormoneAntidiuretic Hormone (or ADH, or Vasopressin), is released from the posterior pituitary in response to increasing osmolarity.This increase in osmolarity is sensed by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus.When there's severe volume contraction, this becomes a much stronger stimulus. But in typical day-to-day scenarios, osmolality is the dominant factor.It is also released in response to ECF volume contraction (similar to the RAAS system), but this stimulus is usually much weaker than osmotic stimulus.ADH acts through V2 receptors, opening Aquaporins in the collecting duct, which facilitate movement of water into the medullary interstitium.However, this would affect the cortex&#8594;medulla gradient that we need to concentrate urine!So in addition, ADH increases urea reabsorption, and the activity of TAL transporters, in order to maintain the concentration of osmotically active solute in the medulla.RememberADH is released in response to increasing osmolarity, via the posterior pituitary.Changes in osmolality are sensed in the hypothalamus.ADH acts on V2 receptors, triggering Aquaporin opening in the collecting duct.Here, we see that aquaporins are predominantly located in the principal cells of the collecting ducts. Remember that ADH acts on V2-receptors to open these! Now water will flow from the renal tubule into the medulla, where there&#39;s a high solute concentration.Non-osmotic Stimuli for ADHDecreased effective circulating volume.Remember that Angiotensin II (from the RAAS system), can increase the release of ADH.As mentioned above however, this stimulus is usually weaker than with an osmotic stimulus.Endocrine disorders (thyroid, adrenal insufficiency).Tumors or infections (CNS, lung).DrugsChlorpropamide.Clofibrate.Phenothiazine.Cyclophosphamide.Carbamazepine.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, a class of antidepressants).Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, commonly called Ecstasy).Desmopressin (ddAVP) or Oxytocin. &#8594; Oxytocin is structurally very similar to ADH!ADH Release BehaviourADH is released in response to an increase in osmolality, in order to dilute the plasma.This is seen in the figure to the right, where we have more ADH release, the higher the serum osmolality is.In addition, you get thirstier &#8594; the more &#8216;salt&#8217; there is, the more water you want to drink to dilute it!ADH is also released in response to volume contraction, in order to retain fluid.Notice the scales of the two charts! When you&#8217;re severely volume contracted, you can get massive amounts of ADH!This superlinear curve makes sense then:Normally osmolality is the dominant factor, when blood volume is within a normal range.But when you have more severe volume depletion, you want the signal strength to grow disproportionately!RememberPlasma osmolality is normally the dominant signal trigger ADH secretion.Volume depletion can become the dominant trigger when it is very severe!ADH Function SummaryConcentrating UrineConcentration of urine requires:Active transport of NaCl from TAL.Water reabsorption in CCD in response to ADH.Water and urea reabsorption in MCD in response to ADH &#8594; aquaporins.Thin descending limb permeable to water allows countercurrent multiplication.Thin ascending limb impermeable to water, allows only NaCl to diffuse into medulla to maintain gradients.Diluting UrineProduction of maximally dilute urine requires:Adequate production of urine, hence adequate GFR.Passive and active transport of NaCl from ascending limb and distal tubule.An absence of ADH.Remember that the concentation/dilution of the urine is primarily determined in the collecting ducts!Water permeability is the primary factor here, although things that affect ion flow in other parts of the nephron (such as loop diuretics) may also play a role.Water Disorders1. HypernatremiaHypernatremia = too little water in the ECF, resulting in an elevated Na(Na &#62; 144 mmol/L).Typically this is due to excess water loss (either from renal or non-renal sources).Unusual in an outpatient setting since the thirst mechanism is so strong, even if ADH is missing (central diabetes insipidus), or doesn&#8217;t work (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus).So access to water is usually enough to maintain near normal water balance.So if this is present, suspect abnormal control &#8594; CNS problem.Or suspect a lack of access to water.Acutely, brain cells can shrink because the increased osmolality in the ECF draws fluid out of the ICF.Chronically, the brain cells accumulate osmolytes to protect their volume.This means that if there&#8217;s a chronic hypernatremia, you have to correct it slowly.If you correct it too fast, you may draw fluid into the ICF, causing the brain cells to become engorged!RememberHypernatremia &#8594; [Na] &#62; 144 mmol/L.Diabetes mellitus and Diabetes insipidus are two completely different diseases! Diabetes insipidus is a condition characterized by extreme thirst, due to faulty ADH production or sensitivity.RememberCentral Diabetes Insipidus &#8594; ADH is missing.Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus &#8594; ADH doesn&#8217;t work.Both cause hypernatremia, because we can&#8217;t open the aquaporins, so we can&#8217;t let water back into the body.2. Hyponatremia.Hyponatremia &#8594; too much water, causing a depression in plasma sodium concentration (&#60; 136 mmol/L).These are usually due to a problem in excreting free water.This doesn&#8217;t correlate with ECF volume overload! It depends on the compartmental distribution, and clinical signs.Pseudohyponatremia can happen with hyperlipidemia (it&#8217;ll affect the lab test), or the presence of other osmoles (eg. glucose in diabetics).RememberHyponatremia &#8594; [Na] &#60; 136 mmol/L.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/10/free-water-handling.html"},
	{"title": "Edema &amp; Assessing Volume Status", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesList physical exam findings of ECF volume expansion and ECF volume contraction.Describe the concept of total body sodium as it relates to ECF volume status.Understand the mechanisms of edema formation.House&#8217;s LawDon&#8217;t forget that:Disorders of serum sodium are actually water handling problems.Disorders of ECF volume are actually sodium handling problems.So dehydration is a bit of a misnomer, when an increase in ECF fluid is actually due to an excess in ECF sodium, not a lack of water!Edematous disorders, which we&#8217;ll be talking about in this lecture, is where we have too much sodium.Similarly, volume contraction is where we have too little sodium.The analogy here is if you take 2 empty pails:In one pail, you put a huge chunk of salt in.In the other pail, you put a few grains in.If you add water to both pails until the salt concentration is equal, the one with more salt will have more volume. This will the edematous guy!The one with less salt will have little volume. This will be the hypovolemic guy with poor skin turgor!EdemaEdema = excessive interstitial fluid volume, and generally implies excessive renal Na+ retention.While edema is &#8220;wet&#8221;, this is a problem of sodium handling, not water handling.Where salt goes, water follows.Anasarca = widespread edema.Ascites = peritoneal edema.Edema in a potential space, such as with a pleural effusion, can also occur. These potential spaces are often referred to as a third space.This is because the ECF normally has two compartments &#8594; the plasma and the interstitium.The potential space is a third space &#8594; it normally doesn&#8217;t exist, but it can sometimes fill up!Starling Forces &#38; Edema$$ \text{Filtration} = K_f \times \left( \Delta{P} - \Delta{\pi} \right) $$Anything altering these forces can cause edema.The \( K_f \), which is the membrane permeability coefficient.One alteration would be endothelial leakiness due to sepsis.The \( \Delta P \), which is the hydrostatic pressure gradient.One alteration would be pulmonary hypertension leading to pulmonary edema.Flow impediments can lead to increased hydrostatic pressure by creating a bottle neck.An easy way to systematically list these is to anatomically go from the left side of the heart to the right, and look for conditions that would affect flow.For instance, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, systolic/diastolic failure, cardiac tamponade affecting pumping, etc.Sodium retention leading to increased total fluid volume also leads to increased hydrostatic pressure.DHP-CCBs also often cause peripheral edema because they cause arteriolar vasodilation, increasing hydrostatic pressure in the vascular bed (less damping).The \( \Delta \pi \), which is the oncotic pressure gradient.One alteration would be decreased albumin production (with end-stage liver disease), or nephrotic syndrome (increased albumin loss).Testing for Changes in VolumeRemember that the CVP, the central venous pressure, was the right atrial pressure, because the veins feed directly into the RA, without any valves.Invasive TestingWe typically start with a physical exam, and move to more invasive testing or imaging to confirm our clinical diagnosis.Central venous pressure monitoring (right atrial pressures), via catheterization.Swan-Ganz catheters (aka. pulmonary artery catheters) can measure pulmonary artery pressures. They have a balloon tip that will carry it all the way to the pulmonary artery, where it will deflate.Biochemical TestsBiochemical tests can sometimes be used to look for Natriuretic Peptides, which are released in response to increased stretch:Atrial Natriuretic Peptides (ANP).B-type Natriuretic Peptides (BNP). Also known as Brain Natriuretic Peptide.This is very new &#8594; only available in some labs.ImagingCXR looking for diffuse infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary edema. Also looking at heart size and shape.Echocardiography looking for fine morphology and fluid flow.Ultrasound of the central veins, hepatic and portal veins. Lets you look for vein distension.Clinical Assessment of ECF OverloadPatients with pulmonary edema sit upright to try to move fluid away from the lungs using gravity.General InspectionDistress, tachypnea, sitting upright, unable to speak full sentences, suggestive of pulmonary edema.Jaundice, scleral icterus, ascites, suggestive of liver disease, which can lead to reduced albumin production.Elevated JVP.Vital SignsHypertension, especially with renal causes.Blood pressure may be normal or even low with a failing heart or liver.Respiratory SignsDecreased fremitus, dullness to percussion, and egophony may indicate an effusion (fluid leaks out, affecting normal resonance).Late inspiratory crackles or wheezes may indicate interstitial edema(the alveoli are crackling open since they were collapsed with fluid).Cardiovascular FindingsPulsus parvus and tardus &#8594; remember you see this in aortic stenosis: the stiff aortic valve slows opening, causing the delayed upstroke.Collapsing Pulse &#8594; remember you see this with aortic regurgitation due to backflow during diastole.Displaced apex suggesting eccentric hypertrophy with CHF.S3 (rapid flow into a baggy ventricle) in CHF.Murmurs &#8594; to help Dx valvular lesions.Elevated JVP.Pitting edema is where a depression in the edematous area stays for a prolonged period of time.NotePitting Edema in dependent areas is most often seen in:CardiacLiverRenal DiseaseOften there will be features that will allow us to narrow the cause down to one of these three etiologies.Clinical Assessment of ECF Volume ContractionGeneral InspectionThe patient may appear dizzy or unsteady, agitated, confused.Will by more comfortable lying flat.Dry mucous membranes.Decreased skin turgor with no edema (check over sternum).Decreased skin turgor is when your skin takes longer to return to its previous form when it&#8217;s pinched up.This is usually done on the back of the hand. In elderly patients, they naturally lose their skin turgor, for over the sternum is better.Look for obvious bleeding (do a rectal exam).Pallor and pale conjunctiva suggests anemia.RememberWith ECF volume overload, the patient will prefer to sit upright to bring fluid away from the lungs.With ECF volume depletion, the patient will prefer to lay flat to increase central fluid flow.Vital SignsWeak, thready pulse, with cool extremities.Tachycardia and hypotension.You may have a normal BP in a younger or fit patient, because there will be strong compensatory mechanisms.In this case, the only finding may be tachycardia, and a fall in SBP &#62; 20 mmHg when going from lying down to standing up.Also, you must consider the BP in context.A patient with hypertension who has acute blood loss may look normotensive, but he actually has relative hypotension.The JVP may be flat, requiring measurement below 30&#176;.Mixed Volume Expansion and Volume ContractionRemember that the ECF is comprised of the plasma and the interstitial space (and sometimes a &#8216;third space&#8217;).This means that it&#8217;s possible for a patient to be volume expanded in one compartment, and volume contracted (or poorly distirbuted) in the other.Example: Congestive Heart FailureIn CHF, forward flow from the LV is impaired, so the arterial intravascular component is effectively volume contracted.If LV-failure leads to RV-failure, then the venous intravascular component is effectively volume expanded due to backflow.There is interstitial volume expansion &#8594; pulmonary edema, ascites, etc.In other words:Findings in Congestive Heart FailurePlasma ComponentArteriolar Volume Contraction.Venous Volume Expansion.Interstitial ComponentInterstitial Volume ExpansionClinical ImplicationsWhen the ECF is contracted in all compartments, treatment is to expand with isotonic fluid.Remember that distribution between the compartments of the ECF only depends on Starling Forces, while the distribution between the ECF and ICF depends on osmolality.So in this case, an isotonic fluid would distribute itself between the ECF compartments only.Remember, always think of the effect of diuretics as salt removal, not water removal. The water removal is the secondary effect!When the ECF is expanded in all compartments &#8594; too much salt &#8594; remove the salt with diuretics/dialysis.In situations where the interstitium is expanded, but the intravascular compartment is contracted, this means that there&#8217;s too much salt in one compartment.In this case, excessive diuretics may contract both compartments, leading to tissue hypoperfusion!You have to be careful to titrate the dose to a level that prevents tissue hypoperfusion from occurring.This makes treating patients with CHF very difficult, as shown below:These are the fluid volumes you would expect to see in the prototypical, 70 kg, male patient, with a Hct of 0.3. His total body water is 42L, 60% of his body weight.Pulmonary edema and pedal edema suggest interstitial volume expansion.Increased JVP and BP suggest intravascular volume expansion.Note that we still have the 3/4 and 1/4 distribution of interstitial fluid to plasma that we&#8217;d expect! There&#8217;s just more of it!So this is an easy case &#8594; he just has more salt, causing water preservation.Just give him a diuretic!The problem with diuretics, is that they cause salt loss from the intravascular compartment.This causes early intravascular volume depletion, before Starling forces can normalize the 3:1 ratio of interstitial:intravascular fluid.So here, acutely, you see a change in the ratio.So even though the patient may still have sympomatic signs of edema, you can&#8217;t treat them further, because further removal may cause hypoperfusion!The patient is out of CHF now, with more diuretics (used slowly).But now the patient is volume depleted, but you can&#8217;t give him a rapid isotonic saline infusion, because his heart may not be able to tolerate it!SummarySodium is the most important cation in the ECFThe body carefully regulates the amount of sodium, but disease states and drugs can impair this regulation.Too little sodium results in ECF contraction while too much results in ECF overload, however the balance of Starling forces may result in an imbalance between the interstitium and the intravascular compartment.Clinical assessment and management of volume disorders need to recognize that multiple compartments exist.Generalized edema most often reflects cardiac, liver or renal disease.Localized edema may reflect local trauma, venous or lymphatic obstruction.RememberVolume contracted in all ECF compartmentsGive isotonic saline.Volume expanded in all ECF compartmentsGive diuretics (or dialysis for more acute Tx).Interstitial expansion with local intravascular contractionGive diuretics carefully, to avoid causing tissue hypoperfusion while trying to eliminate the edema (interstitial fluid)!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/10/edema-assessing-volume-status.html"},
	{"title": "Sodium Handling in the Kidney", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesYou should be able to describe mechanisms of tubular transport of sodium in the kidney.You should be able to describe how the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) helps regulate sodium handling in the kidney.You should have a limited understanding of the signals and effector mechanisms that regulate sodium in response to changes in effective circulating ECF volume.House&#8217;s LawDisorders of serum sodium are actually water handling problems.The change in the serum sodium is due to abnormal dilution or concentration because of problems with water handling.Disorders of ECF volume are actually sodium handling problems.The change in the ECF volume is the normal physiological response to an abnormal change in serum sodium!So even though we can measure the concentration of sodium in the bloodstream, it doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with the bodily concentration of sodium. It&#8217;s a water handling problem!ExamplesHypernatremia = too little free water.Hyponatremia = too much free water.Edematous disorders = too much ECF sodium.Volume contraction = too little sodium.RememberDisorders with serum sodium (hypernatremia, hyponatremia), are due to water handling problems.Disorders with ECF volume, are actually due to sodium handling problems.Fluid Distribution in the BodyPlasma = in blood vessels.Interstitial Fluid = outside of vessels, but outside cells.Extracellular Fluid = Plasma + Interstitial FluidIntracellular Fluid = inside cells.The movement between the plasma and the interstitial fluid is what&#8217;s governed by Starling Forces.The movement between the ECF and the ICF is what&#8217;s governed by osmosis.RememberStarling Forces (hydrostatic, oncotic) govern movement between the plasma and interstitial fluid.Osmosis governs movement between the ICF and the ECF (ECF = plasma + interstitial fluid).Note that in normal situations:40% of the body weight (2/3 of the total body water), is in the ICF.20% of the body weight (1/3 of the total body water), is in the ECF.75% of the ECF is in the interstitium.25% of the ECF is in the plasma.RememberTotal Body Water (TBW) = 60% of your body weight.ICF Volume = 2/3 of your TBW.ECF Volume = 1/3 of your TBW.Interstitial Fluid = 3/4 of your ECF.Plasma = 1/4 of your ECF.Example70 kg male with an Hct of 0.3.His TBW (Total Body Water) is 0.6 times his weight:$$TBW = 0.6 \times 70\text{kg} = 42L$$Of that, 2/3 is in the ICF, and 1/3 is in the ECF:\begin{align}	ECF = TBW \times (1/3) = 42/3 = 14L\\	ICF = TBW \times (2/3) = 84/3 = 28L\end{align}Of the ECF, 3/4 is in the interstitium, and 1/4 is in the plasma:\begin{align}	\text{interstitial fluid} = ECF \times (3/4) = 42/4 = 10.5L\\	\text{plasma} = ECF \times (1/4) = 14/4 = 3.5L\end{align}The blood volume is the volume of the plasma, plus the volume of the cells.From the Hct, we know that 30% of the blood volume will be cells, and 70% will be plasma.From the above calculation, we got that this plasma volume is 3.5L, so the total blood volume &#215; 0.7 = 3.5L. Solving for the blood volume, we have:$$\text{blood volume} = 3.5/0.7 = 5L$$Why is Sodium Handling Important?Na+ is the most important cation in the body, because it most strongly affects osmostic pressure.Na+ salts make up &gt;90% of osmotically active solute in the ECF.As a consequence, Na+ (and hence ECF volume) is highly regulated.Too little ECF &#8594; volume contraction, hypotension, organ hypoperfusion.Too much ECF &#8594; edema, ascites, hypertension.RememberNa+ is what largely drives osmotic pressure.ECF Sensors1. Kidney ECF SensorsDon't forget that ion flow is sensed by the macula densa, and it also triggers renin release!Reduced vascular stretch in the glomerular vascular bed and reduced ion flow in the DCT stimulate the release of renin.As mentioned before:Renin catalyzes angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (AI).Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes AI to AII.AII acts on the adrenals to produce aldosterone.AII also does many other things &#8594; it&#8217;s the major active component of the RAAS.This can occur with &#8217;true&#8217; ECF volume contraction or with &#8216;imagined&#8217; or decreased effective ECF volume.True ECF volume contraction can occur with sodium depletion, diuretics, or acute blood loss.Imagined ECF volume contraction can occur with CHF, cirrhosis, renal artery stenosis.Imagined volume contraction occurs when a change in fluid distribution causes the kidneys to sense that there&#8217;s volume loss, even when there really isn&#8217;t!Why does CHF cause imagined volume contraction?The kidneys are fed immediately downstream of the heart (they branch off of the aorta).So when you have severe CHF impairing pumping out of the heart, the kidneys will perceive it has hypotension, triggering RAAS.However, you may actually have fluid overload &#8594; it&#8217;s just backed up before the heart.So you can paradoxically have pulmonary edema, (or even liver congestion and peripheral edema), but an active RAAS!This is why ACEI are so useful in patients with CHF, and have clear mortality benefits!The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System2. Additional ECF SensorsNote that these baroreceptors are in the same locations as the peripheral chemoreceptors that control the hypoxic ventilatory drive.We saw some of these in Heart &#38; Circulation, with the baroreflex:Carotid baroreceptors in the carotid sinus.Aortic baroreceptors in the aortic arch.Recall that these alter sypathetic tone, changing HR and contractility.There are also stretch receptors in the atria that release ANP.Recall that ANP acts to inhibit the sodium channel in the principal cells of the collecting duct (the opposite of aldosterone).So ANP will increase urine osmolality, causing you to pee more!Effector Functions1. Angiotensin IISystemic vasoconstriction &#8594; this increases blood pressure and tissue perfusion.Increased activity of the Na-coupled cotransporters in the proximal tubule.Remember that solute reabsorption was coupled to the flow of sodium in the proximal tubule.So more activity = more reabsorption = more blood osmolality.Increased adrenal production of aldosterone.Vasoconstriction preferentially of the efferent arteriole, which helps maintain GFR but also increases the filtration fraction.If you squeeze the efferent end more, it&#8217;ll build up hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus.This forces more stuff out of the glomerulus &#8594; increased filtration fraction.This also means that the stuff remaining in the blood will be more concentrated.This increases the peritubular oncotic pressure, which favours fluid reabsorption later on!Don&#8217;t forget the factors that regulate the GFR from the previous lecture on GFR Physiology! We saw that:Summary of AutoregulationIncreasing the GFRAfferent Arteriolar Vasodilation &#8594; Prostaglandins. Also Kinins, ANP, and NO.Efferent Arteriolar Vasoconstriction &#8594; Angiotensin II.Decreasing the GFRAfferent Arteriolar Vasoconstriction &#8594; Prostaglandin blockade. Also ADH, Noradrenaline, and Endothelin.Efferent Arteriolar Vasodilation &#8594; Angiotensin II blockade.2. AldosteroneIncreased sodium reabsorption.Increased activity of Principal Cells and &#945;-intercalated cells causes Na retention, K secretion and alkalosis.Recall that Principal cells are responsible for both Na-retention and K-secretion.Recall that &#945;-intercalated cells are responsible for H+ secretion. Less H+ in the body &#8594; alkalosis.There are clinical conditions which mimic hyperaldosteronism or actually increase aldosterone.Real licorice (which you can get in the Netherlands), contains glycyrrhizic acid, which is the active agent that affects mineralicorticoid metabolism. The licorice you get in North America is actually fake licorice &rarr; it doesn't have these effects!Examples includeConn&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; tumour of the adrenal gland that autonomously produces aldosterone.Adrenal Hyperplasia &#8594; the adrenals are larger/hyperactive.Cushing&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; too much cortisol, which has mineralicorticoid functions that mimic aldosterone.Licorice ingestion &#8594; disrupts metabolism of normal mineralicorticoids, leading to mineralicorticoid excess.All of these will cause:High blood pressure &#8594; increased Na intake from the principal cell increases blood osmolality.Low blood potassium &#8594; increased K export from the principal cell causes hypokalemia.Metabolic Alkalosis &#8594; increased H+ exchange in the &#945;-intercalated cell causes systemic acid loss.Hyperaldosteronism/PseudohyperaldosteronismPotential causes include (CALC acronym):Conn&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; tumour of the adrenal gland that autonomously produces aldosterone.Adrenal Hyperplasia &#8594; the adrenals are larger/hyperactive.Licorice ingestion &#8594; disrupts metabolism of normal mineralicorticoids, leading to a mineralicorticoid excess.Cushing&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; too much cortisol, which has mineralicorticoid functions that mimic aldosterone.These conditions will cause:High Blood Pressure.Low Blood Potassium.Metabolic Alkalosis.3. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)ADH (also called vasopressin) can increase in response to increased osmolality or decreased effective circulating ECF volume, causing:Vasoconstriction.Increased water reabsorption, in the collecting ducts.Modest effects on sodium uptake in the distal nephron (mechanism unclear).Increased filtration fraction, leading to increased Na+ and water reabsorption proximally.RememberADH is mainly involved in fluid retention.4. ProstaglandinsProstaglandins act to:Relax the afferent arteriole (preserving GFR).Inhibit Na/K-ATPases, causing natriuresis throughout the nephron.They generally have the opposite effect as Angiotensin II:Instead of constricting the efferent arteriole, they relax the affferent arteriole.Instead of causing fluid retention, they cause natriuresis.For this reason, NSAIDs, and Coxibs (COX-2 Inhibitors, or prostaglandin inhibitors) can cause significant sodium retention, hypertension, and renal failure, particularly in states of heightened RAAS activity.RememberProstaglandins have the opposite effect as Angiotensin II.NSAIDS or Coxibs inhibit prostaglandins, causing:Decrease of GFR.Fluid retention, potentially causing hypertension.5. Natriuretic PeptidesANP and BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide) can act to shift fluid from the vascular to the interstitial compartment, decreasing the effective circulating volume.Recall that natriuretic peptides inhibit the passive sodium channel in the principal cells of the collecting duct (the opposite effect as Aldosterone)This increases the urine osmolality, resulting in fluid loss!As name implies, they cause natriuresis!SummaryThe RAAS system is the main way the body defends against a decrease in circulating volume.Activation of RAAS causes increased sodium (and hence water) reabsorption directly and indirectly through the tubule.ADH may be activated by severe volume contraction to increase water reabsorption.Counter-regulatory mechanisms include:Prostaglandins.Natriuretic Peptides.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/09/sodium-handling-kidney.html"},
	{"title": "Reabsorption &amp; Secretion", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesDescribe how reabsorption of solute and water from the tubule into the bloodstream, and secretion of solutes from the bloodstream into the tubule, are key aspects of nephron function.List the various components of the renal tubule and how they function to help generate urine.Be able to describe countercurrent multiplication and its importance in both diluting and concentrating the urine.General PrinciplesNa+/K+ ATPases keep the intracellular Na low and the intracellular K high.With respect to the kidney, this means that there&#8217;s always a gradient (both electrochemical and concentration), favouring flow of sodium into the cell.The orientation of the cells is important. Nephron cells have a:Apical Surface &#8594; facing the lumen.Basolateral Surface &#8594; facing the interstitium.The Na+/K+ ATPases are located on the basolateral surface.This makes sense &#8594; you want the flow of charge to be in one direction.Here, you want flow of sodium out of the cells, into the interstitium.If the polarity of this was reversed (ie. the ATPases were on the apical side), the nephron&#8217;s function would be affected!This is what happens with acute tubular necrosis, which is an acute ischemic/toxic injury to the kidney.Here, the polarity of these cells can be lost, which affects the proper direction of ion flow!Transcellular transporters &#8594; transport stuff through cells.Paracellular transporters &#8594; transport stuff between cells.RememberCells lining the renal tubule have an apical side facing the urine and a basolateral side facing the interstitium.Na+/K+ ATPases are located on the basolateral side.The Basics of Fluid FlowNatrium = sodium, and Kalium = potassium. Hence a natriuretic peptide is a peptide that increases sodium secretion.As the excreted fluid travels down the nephron, the volume is reduced, and the composition is altered by reabsorption and secretion of different solutes.These processes can be hormonally regulated:ADH &#8594; Anti-Diuretic Hormone.RAAS &#8594; Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone SystemNatriuretic Peptides &#8594; These help you secrete sodium. Recall ANP that is released via atrial stretch in Heart &#38; Circulation!Why is Reabsorption &#38; Secretion Important?The body makes a tremendous amount of ultrafiltrate (~150-180 L/day) in order to get the waste products out of our blood.However, we need to reabsorb the stuff that isn&#8217;t toxic in order to not only maintain our fluid volume, but also to keep key solutes that our body requires.Concentrations of waste products in urine will be amplified.Concentrations of non-waste products will be reduced.The tubules allow us to make significant changes in the urine composition compared to the plasma.A Trip Down the TubuleOverviewProximal Convoluted Tubule.Thin (Descending &#38; Ascending) Limbs of the Loop of Henle.Thick Ascending Limb of the Loop of Henle.Distal Convoluted Tubule.Collecting Duct.1. At the KidneysAround 25% of CO is diverted to kidneys. This is called the renal blood flow (RBF).The renal plasma flow is [(1 - Hct) &#215; RBF].This makes sense &#8594; remember that the hematocrit was the volume of RBCs/total volume. So (1 - Hct) gives you the non-RBC volume!For instance, if you had 1L of blood, with an Hct of 30%, that means that 70% of it would be plasma, or 700 mL.Around 20% of renal plasma flow is filtered out of the glomerulus. This is called the filtration fraction.Once filtered, the ultrafiltrate arrives in the nephron.Remember	The renal plasma flow is \( [1 - Hct] \times RBF \)	The percentage of renal plasma that is filtered out of the glomerulus is called the filtration fraction2. The Proximal Convoluted TubuleIt&#8217;s approximately 15 mm long, with a single layer of cuboidal cells.About 50-60% of the solute and H2O reabsorption occurs here.It&#8217;s easy to identify histologically because there is a brush-border comprised of microvilli.We saw this in the Histology of the Urinary Tract lecture!As mentioned before, this dramatically increases surface area, increasing the surface area for ion exchance.The brush-border also contains carbonic anhydrase which is important for HCO3 reabsorption!Because intracellular sodium is so low (it&#8217;s pumped out into the interstitium), and there&#8217;s so much filtered sodium, there&#8217;ll be a passive flow of sodium into the cell from the ultrafiltrate.So sodium passively flows back into the tubular cells, because of the concentration gradient.To maintain this concentration gradient, sodium is then actively pumped out from the basolateral side (as said before!).So sodium will flow passively from urine &#8594; proximal tubule cells, and then actively into the interstitium.This sodium flow can mediate other processes:It can couple its movement with other substrates via symporters. These include glucose, amino acids, phosphate, sulfates, citrate, etc.It can exchange itself with other cations (namely H+ and NH4+) via antiporters.Symporters = unidirectional transport.Antiporters = bidirectional transport.A problem with the proximal convoluted tubule can cause problems reabsorbing any of these things that are coupled with sodium flow!For instance, you may see a spike in urine glucose.The Proximal Convoluted TubuleWhere most of the reabsorption of water and solutes occurs.Has a brush-border consisting of microvilli.The brush-border contains carbonic-anhydrase which is critical for the reabsorption of bicarbonate!Sodium flow back into the tubular cells drives the reabsorption of key solutes such as glucose, amino acids, etc.Solute Movement in the Proximal Convoluted TubuleSolute movement is coupled with sodium flow from the urine back into the tubular cells.As the figure shows, sodium flow from the urine into the tubular cells can be:Paired against the flow of H+ out of the tubular cells.Coupled with the flow of glucose, phosphate, and amino acids.So generalized proximal tubular cell disorders cause:Renal Tubular Acidosis &#8594; dysfunctional H+ export (coupled with sodium) leads to the acidosis.Glucosuria, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria &#8594; dysfunctional coupled reabsorption.Not to be confused with Fanconi Anemia, which we saw in Blood. They just happened to be named after the same guy. Also, remember that Fanconi Anemia resulted in pancytopenia, while Diamond-Blackfan Anemia only causes low RBCs.This constellation of symptoms are broadly referred to as Fanconi&#8217;s Syndrome.Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors prevent the conversion of OH- and CO2 into HCO3-, which prevents it from being exported into the interstitium. This causes proximal tubular bicarbonate loss.RememberFanconi&#8217;s Syndrome = spectrum of symptoms associated with proximal tubular cell disorders.Renal Tubular AcidosisGlucosuria, phosphaturia, aminoaciduriaRememberCarbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors cause proximal tubular bicarbonate loss.3. The Thin Loop of HenleCortical nephrons have short loops, juxtamedullary nephrons have long, deep loops.In other words, nephrons on the outside will have short loops, while deeper nephrons will have long loops.The longer the loop of Henle, the better it is at concentrating urine.These will range from 2-14 mm long.The descending limb has little Na+/K+ ATPases so there&#8217;s little solute movement.They are however highly permeable to H2O, important for establishing and maintaining medullary gradients (more later).The ascending limb is impermeable to H2O, while solute moves passively.The Thin Loop of HenleIn the descending limb we have:Permability to water.Impermeability to solute.In the ascending limb we have:Impermeability to water.Permeability to solute.Here we see the differing lengths of nephron &rarr; cortical versus juxtamedullary. As mentioned before, juxtamedullary nephrons have the longest thin loop of Henle.4. The Thick Ascending Limb of HenleThe Thick Ascending Limb is also referred to as the TAL.It&#8217;s ~12 mm long, and spans between the the thin ascending limb of the loop of Henle right to where the distal convoluted tubule meets the glomerulus (at the juxtaglomerular apparatus).Absorbs about 30% of the filtered NaCl, and no H2O.We mentioned previously that the proximal convoluted tubule absorbs 50-60% of the solute.The other 30% of the solute is absorbed here! Remember that there&#8217;s no H2O permeability once the nephron &#8216;turns&#8217;.Both the Thin Ascending Loop of Henle and the Thick Ascending Limb of Henle allow for the transport of solute. However, in the thin ascending loop, this is done passively, while in the thick ascending limb, this is driven actively.Solute is mediated by a Na+K+ and 2 Cl- cotransporter in the apical membrane.This brings Na, K, and 2Cl into the cell, which is electrically neutral.However, since potassium is very &#8216;leaky&#8217; (highly membrane permeable), there is K backleak into the urine &#8594; this makes the urine positively charged.This positive charge then pushes Ca2+, Mg2+, and other cations through the paracellular spaces. This flow is pictured in the below diagram:Solute Movement in the Thick Ascending LimbNa-K-2Cl is the site of action of loop diuretics (furosemide/Lasix). It&#8217;s also the site of a mutation called Bartter Syndrome, which will biochemically imitate a loop diuretic.If you&#8217;re on a loop diuretic, you won&#8217;t have cotransport of Na, K &#38; 2Cl into the tubular cell.This increases the osmolality of the urine, reducing water absorption later on in the collecting ducts. This is what makes you pee more!Loop diuretics cause calcium loss in the urine.There&#8217;s calcium wasting because the flow of calcium back into the tubular cells is driven by the positive charge of the urine.Without the co-transporter, we don&#8217;t have the positive charge, so we don&#8217;t have calcium reabsorption.The Thick Ascending Limb of HenleThe TAL absorbs 30% of the solute, but is water impermeable.It mediates the development of positively charged urine, via the action of a Na-K-2Cl cotransporter.Loop diuretics or Bartter Syndrome (congenital) disrupt the normal function of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter.This positive charge drives the flow of cations such as calcium back into the tubular cells.So patients on loop diuretics or with Bartter will waste calcium.5. The Distal Convoluted TubuleRemember that histologically, the lack of a brush border (resulting in a wider lumen), is what differentiates the distal convoluted tubule from the proximal tubule histologically!The distal convoluted tubule is ~5 mm long with no brush border.Thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl symporter (electrically neutral) draw salt into the tubular cells.This is where we make the urine maximally dilute, by pulling out all the solute!The distal tubule is also the major site of active Ca reabsorption. Ca enters through a Ca channel, and combines with a Vitamin D-induced Ca binding protein (Ca-BP).Solute Movement in the Distal Convoluted TubuleThe Na-Cl symporter channel is thiazide sensitive &#8594; hence this is the site of activity of thiazide diuretics, and a mutation called Gitelman Syndrome.These two are often difficult to distinguish without a sufficient Hx.This is especially true since Gitelman may not necessarily present during childhood.Why is the Ca channel more active when the Na-Cl channel is blocked? It's because blocking the Na-Cl channel reduces the intracellular Na. In response, the Na-Ca pump on the basolateral surface increases its activity in order to increase intracellular Na. This also pumps Ca out, increasing the concentration gradient for Ca flow from the apical sideThiazides block Na-Cl transport (they block the symporter), which increases the activity of the Ca channel.Note that when we had furosemide, it was the positive charge mediated by K backflow after Na-K-2Cl transportation, that caused Ca flow into the cells.However, in this case, the reverse happens &#8594; we have increased Ca flow into the urine, because the Ca channel becomes more active when the Na-Cl channel is blocked.Because thiazide reduces urinary calcium, they&#8217;re useful in patients with kidney stones.The Distal Convoluted TubuleHistologically lacks a brush border.Has thiazide sensitive Na-Cl symporters.Thiazide diuretics or Gitelman Syndrome block their function. These two are hard to differeniate without a Hx.Major site of Ca reabsorption, via a Vitamin D-induced Ca-BP.Bartter vs Gitelman SyndromeBartter SyndromeMimics a loop diuretic.Problem in the thick ascending limb, due to a mutation in the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter.Results in calcium wasting.Gitelman SyndromeMimics a thiazide diuretic.Problem in the distal convoluted tubule, due to a mutation in the Na-Cl symporter.Results in calcium sparing.6. The Collecting DuctRecall that each lobule of the kidney is defined as the set of nephrons that feed into the same collecting ductThe collecting duct is a coalescence of many DCTs!They&#8217;re ~20 mm long, passing through the cortex and medulla to empty into the renal pelvis at the renal papilla.There are 2 major cell types here that line the collecting duct:Principal cells allow passive movement of Na+ leaving the urine negatively charged.Na moves in to the cell because it&#8217;s being pumped out on the basolateral side by Na/K ATPases.The negative charge may pull K+ or H+ out into the urine, or allow Cl- to move into the cell paracellularly. Either will neutralize the urine.This mediates passive H+ movement.&#945;-Intercalated cells have H+-ATPase and K+/H+ exchangers important for acidifying urine.So this mediates active H+ movement.Because both principal cells and &#945;-intercalated cells affect H+ flow into and out of the urine, the collecting duct is critical for acid-base balance.Aquaporins are a family of transporters that control water flow.They&#8217;re regulated by Vasopressin, also known as ADH.Vasopression/ADH acts on V2 receptors.Why is water flow important? The osmolarity of our blood is critical in preventing cerebral swelling or shrinking, so it&#8217;s heavily regulated in the brain (by the hypothalamus).Solute Movement in the Principal CellAldosterone increases activity of the sodium channel, while ANP inhibits the sodium channel, leading to natriuresis.Aldosterone &#8594; increased flow of Na out of the urine.ANP &#8594; decreased flow of Na out of the urine.Recall that ANP is Atrial Natriuretic Peptide.An easy way to remember this is that the water goes where the ions goes, so if there&#8217;s more Na in the urine, there&#8217;ll be more urine!Since Na flow out of the urine leaves a negative charge, we have flow of K out.This is where 95% of our K excretion occurs.So principal cells are key to our potassium handling!So aldosterone is one of our triggers to excrete K!K+ sparing diuretics (amiloride, triamterene) actually block the passive sodium channel.We block the above effect &#8594; by preventing Na flow into the cell, we prevent the build-up of a negative urine charge.Without this electrostatic gradient, there&#8217;s less flow of potassium out!Aldosterone antagonists (such as spironolactone or eplerenone) access the nucleus of the cell through the blood side.These block the aldosterone receptor in the principal cell, which prevents aldosterone from opening the sodium channel.As a result, the negatively charged urine doesn&#8217;t form, so potassium can&#8217;t be excretedThis is why spironolactone and eplerenone cause hyperkalemia!The Principal Cell of the Collecting DuctSensitive to aldosterone, which opens the sodium channel, allowing for flow back into the cell.Maintains body fluid volume.Allows for K to be excreted.So (1) aldosterone antagonists, (2) K+ sparing diuretics, and (3) ANP, which reduce sodium channel opening:Reduce body fluid volume.Prevent K excretion.This is why aldosterone antagonists &amp; potassium sparing diuretics &#8595;BP but also increase the risk for hyperkalemia!They also cause renal-tubular acidosis because urinary K is needed for H+ export from the &#945;-intercalated cell (seen later).Solute Movement in the &alpha;-Intercalated CellThis is where hydrogen is exchanged.Hydrogen is actively pumped out of the urine.Hydrogen is exchanged for potassiumThe potassium exchange requires the negative charge established by the sodium channels in the principal cell! This is because that negative charge was what got the K into the urine in the first place.Things interfering with Principal Cell function (i.e. lack of aldosterone, K+ sparing diuretics) cause both elevated potassium and renal tubular acidosis (more later).The elevated potassium is because we don&#8217;t have the negative charge pulling it out.The renal tubular acidosis is because we don&#8217;t have H+ export from the &#945;-intercalated cell via K exchange.In other words, the function of the &#945;-intercalating cell is dependent on the principal cell:Principal Cell broken &#8594; &#945;-intercalating cell broken.However, the opposite may not apply.So if only the principal cell was affected, we will have both a potassium problem, and an acid-base problem!But if only the &#945;-intercalated cell was affected, we&#8217;d only have the acid-base problem, but not the potassium problem.The &#945;-Intercalated Cell of the Collecting DuctInvolved in the export of H+ &#8594; this acidifies the urine.H+/K+ exchange requires K in the urine, which itself requires the negative charge established by the principal cell.Without this, H+ stays in the renal tubule, causing renal tubular acidosis.Summary of the Nephron1. Proximal Convoluted TubuleMost reabsorption (50-60%) occurs here, driven by the flow of sodium back into the tubular cells.Has a brush border with carbonic anhydrase.Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors block the export of intracellular HCO3-.2. Thin Loop of HenleThe descending loop is water permeable but solute impermeable.The ascending loop is water impermeable but solute permeable.3. Thick Ascending LimbThe TAL of the Loop of Henle is where the second-most solute reabsorption occurs (30%), after the PCT.Reabsorption of cations (Ca, Mg), is driven by positive charge in the urine, caused by the backflow of K, after it&#8217;s been pumped into the tubular cells by Na-K-2Cl cotransporters.Loop Diuretics or Bartter Syndrome block the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, preventing the positive charge to accumulate, reducing calcium reabsorption.4. Distal Convoluted TubuleThe DCT can be differentiate from the PCT by the absence of a brush-border.Thiazide Diuretics or Gitelman Syndrome block the Na-Cl symporter here, increasing the activity of the calcium channel, increasing calcium reabsorption.Calcium reabsorption here requires activated Vitamin D, which activates Ca-BP.5. Collecting DuctHas principal cells and &#945;-intercalated cells.Principal Cells have a passive sodium channel.Important in regulating potassium &#8594; Na import creates a urine negative charge that pulls K out of the cell.The Na channel is regulated by aldosterone (&#8593; activity) and ANP (&#8595; activity).&#945;-Intercalated Cells mediate the acidification of urine, and rely on the function of the principal cell.Aquaporins insert into these cells to allow for the flow of water. They are sensitive to ADH/Vasopressin.Countercurrent MultiplicationUrine Concentration &#38; DilutionYour body needs to be able to adequately respond to changes in blood volume due to fluid intake or loss.For the kidney, this means they must be able to accomodate a broad range of urinary concentrations.Countercurrent &#8216;multiplication&#8217;, or &#8216;amplification&#8217;, refers to the maintenance of:Concentrated ultrafiltrate in the Medulla.Dilute ultrafiltrate in the Cortex.In other words, it maintains a concentration gradient from the cortex to the medulla.Countercurrent MultiplicationRemember that the descending limb is impermeable to solute, but permeable to water.So as the ultrafiltrate moves down the descending limb, water moves out, concentrating the urine.Once we reach the TAL, we have further active pumping of solute out of the filtrate, via the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter.As we move back up the ascending limb, we have impermeability to water, and permeability to solute.So as the filtrate moves back up the ascending limb, we have solute moves out, diluting the urine.Since the solute concentration is higher deeper in the medulla than superficially at the cortex, we have more solute leaving to the interstitium the deeper we are! This creates the concentration gradient.This means that we have a high osmolality in the medulla, versus a low osmolality in the cortex.Normally, capillaries take away this solute, absolving the cortex &#8594; medulla concentration gradient. But in this case, this does not happen!This is because the vasa recta capillaries, run anti-parallel to the nephron (see bottom figure).If there&#8217;s ADH, we&#8217;ll have further movement of water out of the collecting duct (reducing the amount of urine).This is what results in the high concentrations of urine that leave into the renal pelvis!Urine can range from a low of ~50 mOsml/L, to a high of ~1200 mOsm/L.With ADH &#8594; aquaporins open &#8594; water leaves collecting tubule &#8594; concentrated urine.Without ADH &#8594; aquaporins closed &#8594; water stays in the collecting duct &#8594; dilute urine.The range of concentrations you can have gets narrower with impaired kidney function as you age.NoteA general rule of thumb is that whenever you&#8217;re moving down the nephron, you&#8217;re concentrating the urine, and whenever you&#8217;re moving up the nephron you&#8217;re diluting the urine.The exception is the proximal convoluted tubule &#8594; it&#8217;s going down, but it&#8217;s involved in diluting the urine!To remember this, note that both the proximal and distal convoluted tubule are involved in solute re-absorption (urine dilution).Here we see why the concentration gradient is maintained in the capillaries.Since the vasa recta runs anti-parallel to the renal tubule, solute concentrates the blood as it enters the renal tubule, and the water dilutes the blood as it leaves.Because solute enters the vasa recta from both the TAL and the collecting duct, this is why it&#8217;s termed counter-current multiplication.Concentration is amplified from currents running in both directions!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/09/reabsorption-secretion-trip-down-tubule.html"},

ADH regulates water permeability in the collecting duct.RememberThe distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs NaCl in an aldosterone-dependent manner.The collecting duct reabsorbs H2O in an ADH-dependent manner.The Juxtaglomerular ApparatusMacula Densa Cells run along the distal convoluted tubule.As befitting their name, there are densely packed together, so that they appear dark under histological section.They measure the NaCl content, and feed this signal to the granular cells that lie along the arterioles, and mediate renin release.Extraglomerular Mesangial CellsCan regulate contraction of the arterioles.Thought to affect EPO secretion.Juxtaglomerular CellsAlso known as granular cells.These respond to increased ionic flow or decreased stretch, by triggering the release of renin.Here you can see a histological image showing the distal convoluted tubule, afferent arteriole, macula densa, and the juxtaglomerular cells.The Renal CortexAt this magnification, you don&#8217;t see the renal corpuscles &#8594; only the tubules.As mentioned before, the proximal tubules have a small lumen, and the distal tubules have a wide lumen.The reason the proximal tubules have a small lumen is because the cells of the endothelial lining form a brush-border.The brush-border is a term that signifies microvilli that protrude from the apical end.This dramatically increases surface area, increasing the surface area for ion exchance.Below in an EM image showing a cross sectional view of the proximal convoluted tubule.Again, we see the microvilli that constitute the brush-border.We also see abundant mitochondria, which mediate active-ion exchange.At the basal ends of these cells, we see basal infoldings.The mitochondria basically fill up the cell completely.There is a basement membrane wrapping around the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, which attaches to a fenestrated epithelium, just like at the glomerulus.The Renal MedullaWe see loops of henle, with blood vessels wrapping between them called vasa recta.In this case, we would be at the thick limbs of the loops of Henle, because we see thicker cuboidal cells lining them, and not the archetypical squamous epithelium that are seen in the thin parts.Here we can differentiate the thin loop of Henle, with its squamous epithelial cells, from the thick segment, with more cuboidal cells.The collecting tubule can be differentiated from the thick loop of Henle because of the clear cell borders, as has been mentioned previously.Here we see the same, thing, where:The thin loop of Henle has squamous epithelial cells.The vasa recta, which can de histologically identified from the thin loop of Henle by the presence of RBCs.The thick loop of Henle, which has cuboidal epithelial cellsBefore the urine leaves, the kidney, the collecting ducts pool into a papillary ducts.These are also known as ducts of Bellini.They exit into the calyces, at the renal papilla, as mentioend before.Histologically, these papillary ducts will have columnar epithelium that open at the tips of the renal papillae.The UreterThe ureter (and the bladder) is lined with what&#8217;s known as transitional epithelium.At low magnification, this transitional epithelium is easily mistaken for stratified epithelium.There is a characteristic star shaped lumen.When the ureter is empty, the lumen is star shaped.When the ureter is full, the lumen dilates.RememberThe ureter and bladder are lined with transitional epithelium.The ureter is actually morphologically similar to the esophagus.However, there is one key difference:In the ureter, there are two smooth muscle layers:An inner longitudinal layer.An outer circular layer.The same applies to the esophagus, but the arrangement is reversed:An outer longitudinal layer.An inner circular layer.This lets us histologically differentiate the two!Differentiating the Ureter and the EsophagusThe ureter has an inner longitudinal layer and an outer circular layer.The esophagus has an outer longitudinal layer and an inner circular layer.An alternative name for the transitional epithelium is urothelium.Upon examination, it was discovered that this transitional epithelium aren&#8217;t actually stratified &#8594; they&#8217;re pseudostratified.That is, instead of having multiple layers (seen on the left), we have a single layer of cells with variable length.All cells in transitional epithelium will touch the basement membrane, but they&#8217;ll have different shapes.This gives the illusion of layers.Recall that we saw this in Introduction to Medicine!This attachment to the basement membrane is functionally useful when the urothelium stretches and contracts &#8594; it allows the urothelium to revert to its original shape.Histologically, the shape of the transitional epithelium will get flatter as the ureter fills, and gets thicker as the ureter contracts.This transitional capacity is why this epithelium is called transitional epithelium!RememberTransitional epithelium is pseudostratified, and can easily stretch and return to its original shape.Below is a low-magnification image of the urinary bladder.It&#8217;s effectively a giant muscular sac &#8594; hence we see bundles of smooth muscle, which will mediate bladder contraction/relaxation.These bundles of smooth muscle are separated by lamina propria.Lamina propria refers to the layer next to the epithelium.It consists of loose connective tissue that brings in blood vessels, and immune cells.As with the ureter, the transitional epithelium lines the cavity of the bladder, which mediates the distensibility of the bladder.Polyploid superficial dome-shaped cells line the bladder wall.These function to protect the transitional epithelium from the urine.They have a neat system for increasing their surface area without producing more cell membrane.They effectively have islands of transmembrane proteins, linked by cytosolic proteins.These cytosolic proteins unfold as the bladder expands, increasing the surface area.As the bladder contracts, they fold back up again.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/08/histology-urinary-tract.html"},
	{"title": "GFR Physiology", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesDescribe glomerular filtration and the glomerular filtration rate.Describe how Starling Forces influence fluid movement a) between capillaries and interstitial fluid and b) between capillaries and Bowman&#8217;s capsule.Given the necessary information, calculate net filtration pressure.Glomerular Filtration RateGlomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal glomerular capillaries into Bowman&#8217;s capsule per unit time.Glomerular filtration involves the flow of (mostly) protein-free plasma.Glomerular FiltrateGlomerular filtrate is a finely filtered extract (ultrafiltrate) of plasma.It has the same salt composition as plasma (minus the blood cells) but has very little protein.Glomerular filtrate composition changes in its passage down the nephron.The Glomerular CapillariesThe endothelial lining is fenestrated.The epithelial lining has podocytes that form foot processes, through which there are filtration slits.What does Filtration Depend on?The unique nature of capillaries and their filtration coefficient, or \( K_f \).The kidneys happen to have a very high \( K_f \) &#8594; they&#8217;re very leaky!This was explained previously &#8594; the capillaries of the glomeruli are fenestrated &#8594; they have holes in them!Cranial capillaries have a low \( K_f \) &#8594; they have a strong blood-brain barrier.Starling forces (the difference between the hydrostatic pressure, \( P \), and colloid oncotic pressure, \( \pi \)). This is the same equation that we saw before:$$ \text{Filtration} = K_f \times \left( \Delta{P} - \Delta{\pi} \right) $$Disregarding the coefficient, which are constant, this means that the rate of filtration through the glomerulus depends on:Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure &#8594; \( P_{c} \).Capillary Fluid Colloidal Oncotic Pressure &#8594; \( \pi_{c} \).Interstitial Fluid Hydrostatic Pressure &#8594; \( P_{IF} \).Interstitial Fluid Colloidal Oncotic Pressure &#8594; \( \pi_{IF} \).1. Capillary Hydrostatic PressureThe main driving force of glomerular filtration.Think of this as a garden hose &#8594; the higher the pressure, the stronger the force through the nozzle at the end.This is a positive force that pushes fluid out of the glomerulus.2. Interstitial Fluid Colloidal Oncotic PressureThis is a positive force that pulls fluid out of the glomerulus.For instance, high protein concentrations outside the vascular bed that draw water out.3. Capillary Fluid Colloidal Oncotic PressureThis is a negative force that pulls fluid into the glomerulus.The key protein here is albumin, that keeps water in the capillaries.4. Interstitial Fluid Hydrostatic PressureThis is usually a minor player &#8594; typically ignored, because it&#8217;s roughly equal to zero.But if the \(P_{IF}\) was non-negligible, it would be a negative force that pushes fluid back into the glomerulus.One example of this with respect to glomerular filtration would be with a kidney stone &#8594; a blockage in flow causes a build-up in fluid that increases the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman&#8217;s capsule.Net Filtration PressureThe net filtration pressure is the difference between the pressures pushing fluid out, and the pressures pulling fluid in.Intuitively, it's:$$\text{Net Filtration Pressure} = (P_c + \pi_{IF}) - (P_{IF} + \pi_c ) $$Size and Charge Affect Flow Across the Glomerulus1. Size MattersSmall proteins, such as insulin, can get through.Large proteins, such as hemoglobin, or albumin, generally can&#8217;t.As mentioned previously, the limit for size filtration is around 70 kDa.2. Charge MattersAs mentioned before, the basement membrane contains negatively charged proteins that act to &#8216;repel&#8217; negatively charged proteins.This is important in preventing albumin, which is negatively charged, from flowing through.Proteins that are positively charged flow better through the glomerulus.AutoregulationGFR is maintained at a relatively constant level over arterial BPs of 80-170 mmHg &#8594; important for homeostatic purposes!This is achieved through various feedback loops, mediated by myogenic stretch responses and neurohormonal influences that maintain renal blood flow and filtration.As seen in the figure to the right, the GFR and renal blood flow remain fairly constant over a fairly wide range of arterial pressures.How is Autoregulation Mediated?If you want to increase the glomerular filtration rate, you would want to increase flow in, or decrease flow out:Afferent Arteriolar Vasodilation &#8594; via. Prostaglandins, Kinins, Dopamine (low dose), ANP, NO.Efferent Arteriolar Vasoconstriction &#8594; via. Angiotensin II.If you want to decrease the glomerular filtration rate, you would want to decrease flow in, or increase flow out:Afferent Arteriolar Vasoconstriction &#8594; via Noradrenaline (Sympathetic nerves), Endothelin, ADH, Prostaglandin blockade.Efferent Arteriolar Vasodilation &#8594; via Angiotensin II blockage.These changes will change the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus &#8594; it&#8217;s the hydrostatic pressure that&#8217;s the main target of autoregulation.So if you give a patient ACEI, it causes some degree of efferent arteriolar vasodilation, which decreases the GFR (bad), but also decreases glomerular afterload, which is very good (reduces renal failure).But in cases where you are severely hypotensive, ACE inhibitors are obviously dangerous, because they prevent our normal compensatory response from occuring.NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors block prostaglandins, so they can cause afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, so they can also affect our normal physiological response.Summary of AutoregulationIncreasing the GFRAfferent Arteriolar Vasodilation &#8594; Prostaglandins. Also Kinins, ANP, and NO.Efferent Arteriolar Vasoconstriction &#8594; Angiotensin II.Decreasing the GFRAfferent Arteriolar Vasoconstriction &#8594; Prostaglandin blockade. Also ADH, Noradrenaline, and Endothelin.Efferent Arteriolar Vasodilation &#8594; Angiotensin II blockade.RememberAngiotensin II constrict the efferent arterioles.It can be blocked by ACE Inhibitors.Prostaglandins dilate the afferent arterioles.It can be blocked by NSAIDS.The Juxtaglomerular ApparatusAs we said before, this is where the distal convoluted tubule bends back towards the glomerulus, near this juxtaglomerular apparatus.As described before, the components of the juxtaglomarular apparatus are:Components of the Juxtaglomerular ApparatusMacula Densa of the Thick Ascending LimbSenses the ionic content of the tubular fluid, and can act on granular cells to change renin levels.Extraglomerular Mesangial CellsJuxtaglomerular Cells/Granular CellsStore and release renin, in response to stretch receptors in the afferent arteriole.The RAAS ResponseHomeostasis is disturbed, causing a drop in the GFR.A decrease in afferent arteriole stretch is felt by stretch receptors, triggering the release of renin by granular cells.Renin mediates the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II by ACE. The net result is that angiotensin is activated.The activation of angiotensin triggers the elevation of blood pressure and volume via a number of factors:Direct vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles, as mentioned earlier.Formation of aldosterone, which increases blood volume.Acts on the CNS to increase thirst, produce ADH, and increase sympathethetic motor tone.This returns the body to normal homeostasis.What if the GFR Increases?Macula densa cells will sense an increase in the ionic flow.This sends a signal to the afferent arteriole to vasoconstrict to lower the GFR back to normal.This feedback from the tubules to the glomerulus is called Tubulo-Glomerular Feedback.It can be impaired by loop diuretics.Tubulo-Glomerular FeedbackIn response to an increase in the GFR, macula densa cells detect an increase in ionic flow, and trigger afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction.This keeps the GFR stable.Applied ExampleClinical CorrelationA 72 year old woman with congestive heart failure is prescribed an NSAID for osteoarthritis and ACE inhibitor for her heart failure.She develops decreased urine output, increasing edema and rising serum creatinine.What happened?CHF led to decreased perfusion pressure and impaired GFR which is usually counteracted by activation of the RAAS and increased prostaglandins.Blockade of prostaglandins by the NSAIDS led to constriction of the afferent arteriole, and blockade of the RAAS by the ACE inhibitor led to dilation of the efferent arteriole.Both function to decrease the GFR by reducing the hydrostatic pressure.This causes increased fluid retention, presenting as edema, and increasing serum creatinine.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/08/gfr-physiology.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Urinary Tract, Kidneys, Ureters, &amp; Adrenals", "text": "Kidney, Ureter, &#38; Adrenal Gland NotesSee Kidney, Ureter, &amp; Adrenal Gland Notes.The kidneys are tucked posteriorly in the retroperitoneal space.There is little bony protection &#8594; they&#8217;re somewhat protected by the last 2 ribs (ribs 11 &#38; 12), but not completely.They are positioned somewhat laterally, so when we operate on the kidney, it&#8217;s often from a posterolateral approach.They can extend from T12-L3 &#8594; this varies from person to person, and also changes when you&#8217;re lying down versus standing up.Posterior Position of the KidneyThe kidney is split into two poles.Your upper pole should be medial to your lower pole. That is, the kidneys should turn inwards.In other words, the hilum of the kidney should go medially to laterally, moving from the top down.If your upper pole is lateral to your lower pole, it&#8217;s often suggestive of a horseshoe kidney.Recall that with a horseshoe kidney, the lower lobes of the kidney merge during ascent, causing them to be more medial than the upper lobes.Coming out of the hilum, and running along the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, is the ureter.Anterior Position of the KidneyAnteriorly, the kidneys actually sit pretty high up in the abdomen &#8594; at the transpyloric plane (at L1). - This will be discussed in detail in the GI block next year.The transpyloric plane is called that because it goes through the pylorus of the stomach.The upper right kidney will lie on this plane.The lower left kidney will lie on this plane.This is because the right kidney is lower because the liver pushes it down.RememberThe right kidney is lower than the left kidney because it&#8217;s pushed down by the liver.Anterior Relations of the Right KidneyOn the right side, the liver lies anteriorly to the kidney.The adrenals sit on the superior pole. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re also called the suprarenal glands.The duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), sits anteriorly to the hilum of the kidney.The hepatic flexure is at the lower pole of the right kidney.The ileum will often loop anteriorly to the hilum as well.Anterior Relations of the Left KidneyThe tail of the pancreas lies on top of the left kidney.The adrenals sit on the superior pole, as with the right.The stomach is also anterior to the kidneys.The spleen lies posterior to the stomach, but anterior to the kidney.The splenic flexure of the colon is anterior too. So blood vessels feeding the colon would not communicate with those feeding the kidney &#8594; they&#8217;re in different compartments.The jejunum often loops anteriorly to the left kidney.RememberThe kidney (and adrenals) is anterior to all these structures because they&#8217;re retroperitoneal.Fascial Layers around the KidneyLayers surrounding the KidneyAnteriorly to posteriorly, we have:Peritoneum &#8594; lines the abdominal cavity, and separates the abdominal structures from the retroperitoneal space.Renal Fascia &#8594; the fascia surrounding the kidney and the fat that wraps around it.Perirenal Fat (Adipose Fascia) &#8594; fat between the renal fascia and the renal capsule to help keep the kidney in place and protect it.Renal Capsule &#8594; the kidney itself is surrounded by a fibrous cover called the renal capsule.Pararenal Fat &#8594; Sits outside the renal fascia, deep to it! (posterior to the kidney and the fascia).Note that we have both renal fascia and a renal capsule &#8594; two layers of membrane!We also have perirenal fat and pararenal fat &#8594; two regions of fat!Perirenal fat lies between the renal fascia and the renal capsule.Pararenal fat lies outside the renal fascia, deep to the kidney.Transverse cut from a cadaver and a CT scan showing the fascia and fat surrounding the kidneys.Note that fat will appear white on a CT scan.The Renal Vessels and the UreterThe kidneys are being fed by the renal arteries, which branch off of the descending aorta.Blood returns via the renal veins, which dump into the inferior vena cava.The position of the renal arteries and vein are somewhat complicated.The veins run more anterior to the arteries, as shown in the picture.This orientation changes as you get closer to the hilum of the kidney &#8594; note that in the picture, as we get closer to the hilum, the renal arteries become more anterior to the renal veins!This is useful when you&#8217;re looking for the hilum anatomically!RememberThe renal veins run anteriorly to the renal arteries, except as they near the hilum, where the renal arteries wrap around anteriorly.Kidneys look a lot like spleens, except that they don&#8217;t have ureters!Just below the renal vessels are the gonadal vessels.In males these would be testicular arteries and testicular veins.In females these would be ovarian arteries and ovarian veins.The venous drainage of the kidneys are different between the two sides:On the left side, the left renal vein has the gonadal vein and suprarenal vein feed directly into it.On the right side, the gonadal vein and suprarenal vein connect directly to the IVC.So if you get compression out of the left renal vein, you not only get reduced perfusion to the left kidney, but also to the left adrenal, and the left gonads!RememberOn the left side, the gonadal vein and the suprarenal vein feed directly into the left renal vein.There is also a branch off the aorta called the superior mesenteric artery, referred to as the SMA.This artery supplies most of the small intestine, and part of the large intestine.It wraps over the left renal vein!Since the SMA is an artery, with a thick muscular wall, it can easily compress the more distensible left renal vein. This is a common cause of left renal vein compression!The SMA and the Aorta will effectively squish the renal vein like a nutcracker.This may be seen in partients with hypertension, with an AAA, or during pregnancy.The pancreas sandwiches the SMA both anteriorly and posteriorly, so if you get pancreatic cancer, you can also have the same thing happen.RememberThe SMA wraps over the renal vein, and is a common cause of left renal vein compression.Note that the renal vessels branch at around L2. You can also see how the renal arteries wrap around the renal veins as we get nearer to the hilum. The SMA is not visible here because it has been dissected out.Review on the Real ThingThe kidneys are one of the few things that will actually look the same on a dissection as they do in a book!Here we can see how the renal papillae merge into calyces, that eventually feed into the renal pelvis.We can also actually see how the interlobar arteries go between lobes of the kidney, arch parallel to the line of the cortex and the medulla (forming arctuate arteries), and end up branching between lobules as interlobular arteries.This is an example of right renal cancer. Note the distension on CT, in the transverse section, and the presence of a tumour with the coronal section.The Course of the UreterAs mentioned before, the kidneys are deep to the peritoneum, and vessels branch off at the hilum at around L2.The ureter will run along the psoas muscle and is crossed over by the gonadal vessels.This is the bridge over troubled water &#8594; the urine being the troubled water!Why is this important? The ureter and the gonadal vessels look extremely similar. You wouldn&#8217;t want to cut the wrong one!It then crosses the pelvic brim and passes over the iliac vessels.Recall that the mesonephric duct becomes the vas deferens, which will loop over the ureter. In the female, it&#8217;s the uterine artery that crosses over the ureter.Finally, the ureter enters the posterolateral aspect of the bladder.RememberThe ureter follows the following path:Runs along the psoas muscle.Goes under the gonadal vessels.Passes over the iliac vessels.Passes under the vas deferens/uterine artery (in males/females).Course of the Ureter in MaleCourse of the Ureter in FemaleRadiographic Landmarks for the UreterForms from the renal pelvis and descends.It travels along the psoas, as said before, but the bony landmark would be the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae.As it crosses the brim of the pelvis and the iliac vessels, you can see the joint between the sacrum and ileum &#8594; the sacroiliac joint.It curves to enter the bladder, around the ischial spine.Radiographic Landmarks for the UreterForms from the renal pelvis. (L1/L2)Runs adjacent to the tranverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae.Crosses over the iliac vessels near the sacroiliac joint.Curves to enter the bladder at the level of the ischial spine.The Adrenal/Suprarenal GlandsLie in the renal fascia, but lie outside the renal capsule &#8594; they&#8217;re embedded in the perirenal fat.So the adrenal glands will look a lot like fat! Be careful when you&#8217;re excising the fat not to take out the adrenals &#8594; follow its vascular supply.It&#8217;s an endocrine organ, so it&#8217;ll have a massive blood supply.The adrenals are fed by 3 suprarenal arteries, arising from:Inferior Phrenic &#8594; Superior Adrenal Artery.Aorta &#8594; Middle Adrenal Artery.Renal Artery &#8594; Inferior Adrenal Artery.As mentioned before, the suprarenal veins, of which there is only 1 per side, have a different course for the left kidney versus the right:On the left side, the suprarenal vein feeds into the left renal vein.On the right side, the suprarenal vein feeds directly into the IVC.The adrenal has an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The medulla part is effectively a sympathetic neuron (remember this from Cholinergic Pharmacology)!We have preganglionic symphathetic innervation to the adrenal medulla (which, as we recall, is via nicotinic receptors), via the celiac plexus.Vessels of the Adrenal/Suprarenal GlandsArteriesThere are 3 arteries feeding each adrenal:Superior Adrenal Artery coming from the Interior Phrenic.Middle Adrenal Artery coming from the Aorta.Inferior Adrenal Artery coming from the Renal Artery.VeinsThere is 1 vein draining each adrenal &#8594; the suprarenal vein.On the left side, it drains into the left renal vein.On the right side, it drains into the IVC.InnervationThere is preganglionic symphathetic innervation of the Adrenal medulla via the celiac plexus.Kidney StonesKidney stones generally form in the kidney, but can also form in the bladder.Common sites of kidney stone deposition follow from the areas where the urinary pathways narrow:The narrowing of the renal pelvis to the ureter.The opening of the ureter into the bladder.From the bladder to the urethra.Can also occur where the ureter crosses over the iliac vessels &#8594; potential for compression.How do you distinguish kidney pain from kidney stone pain?How do you differentiate pain coming from the kidneys and pain coming from passing of a kidney stone?The kidneys and the ureter actually have different innervation.The kidney is sympathetically innervated by the superior &amp; intermesenteric ganglia and the aorticorenal plexus, therefore T10-L1.The ureter is sympathetically innervated by the renal plexus and the hypogastric plexus &#8594; therefore T12-L2Kidney pain is often described as putting on a pair of shorts. (See red in the above figure).T10 is around the level of the umbilicus.L1 is around the groin area.Ureter pain is often described as loin to groin (See green in the above figure).Since it&#8217;s from T12 to L2, it&#8217;ll extend a little lower than kidney pain, and go a little further down.Also, it&#8217;ll more commonly be unilateral.RememberKidney Pain &#8594; putting on a pair of shorts.Ureter Pain &#8594; loin to groin.ReviewWhat is at each number?The large intestine &#8594; seen as gassy splotches.Is the patient young or elderly?The patient is elderly (will learn this in MSK).Vertebral column &#8594; L1/L2 since around level of hilum.

	{"title": "Histology of the Kidney", "text": "Recall that the functions of the nephron are:Production of ultrafiltrate from blood.Conservation of water, electrolytes and metabolites.Removal of metabolic waste.There are approximately 2 million nephrons per kidney!Anatomy of the KidneyThe outer area is the cortex.The inner area is the medulla.The medulla is composed of many little inverted pyramids, each of which is a lobe of the kidney.Filtrate is produced in the cortex, and moves down the medullary pyramids into a renal papilla.These renal papilla then open into a calyx, which is sort of like a sub-funnel.These calyces then join into a funnel structure called the renal pelvis, which then connects to the ureter.RememberUrine is formed in the cortex, and moves into the medullary pyramid &#8594; renal papilla &#8594; calyx &#8594; renal pelvis &#8594; ureter.Histology of the Renal CortexRenal corpuscles can be seen here, with a visible glomerulus and Bowman&#8217;s capsule.There is a dense connective tissue capsule surrounding corpuscles of the cortex, which is needed because of the significant hydrostatic forces generated at the glomerulus.You can also see components of the tubule here &#8594; distal and proximal convoluted tubules.As we mentioned yesterday:Proximal tubules have a thick epithelium &#8594; lots of energy there to drive a ton of transporters.Distal Tubules have a thin epithelium &#8594; less metabolically active.RememberProximal Tubules have a thick epithelium.Distal Tubules have a thin epithelium.Histology of the Renal MedullaThe renal medulla contains tubules that all run in parallel.Note that these tubules are in close association with blood vessels (the vasa recta, which we saw yesterday).These are the dark pink areas between the tubules.As mentioned previously, they mediate reabsorption from the urine.Histology of the Renal PapillaThese are at the bottom of the renal medulla.Recall that urine leaves the renal medulla at the renal papillae.As said before, renal papilla &#8594; calyx &#8594; renal pelvis &#8594; ureter.Anatomy of the NephronFrom the cortex to the medulla, the tubule changes from a thick walled tube, to a thin-walled tube.Histologically, this is mediated by a change from cuboidal epithelium around the thick limbs, to squamous epithelium around the thin limbs.At the end of the renal tubule, the urine will feed into a collecting tubule/duct.The uriniferous tubule = nephron + collecting duct.Many different collecting ducts will feed into a common collecting duct.In fact, each nephron that feeds into the same common collecting duct is part of the same lobule of the kidney.Note that each lobe of the kidney contains lobules.These lobules are then the parallel tubules that will feed into the same collecting duct.These lobules extend out into the renal cortex as medullary rays.RememberEach lobe of the kidney has lobules.Each lobule is defined as the set of nephrons that feed into the same common collecting duct.Blood supply to lobules comes from arteries that run between lobes, aptly named interlobar arteries. These come from the renal pelvis.These interlobar arteries then arch and run along the border between the cortex and medulla &#8594; these branches are called arctuate arteries.These arctuate arteries then give off branches that travel between lobules, aptly named interlobular arteries. These supply the blood feeding the glomeruli.RememberInterlobar artery &#8594; arctuate artery &#8594; interlobular artery.Morphogenesis of the Renal CorpuscleThe primitive renal tubule associates with a developing glomerulus.The glomerulus is strange in that it&#8217;s a capillary system preceded by an afferent arteriole and succeeded by an efferent arteriole.It&#8217;s a capillary network surrounded by two &#8216;like&#8217; blood vessels &#8594; they&#8217;re both arterioles!This is called an arterial portal system &#8594; capillaries formed by an arteriole, and continued by an arteriole.This reflection into a parietal and visceral layer is exactly the same as what we saw with the pleura of the lungs, and the pericardium of the heart.This developing glomerulus makes an indentation in the primitive renal tubule, causing invagination.It invaginates far enough that it creates a double membrane.The outer layer becomes the parietal layer of Bowman&#8217;s capsule.The inner layer becomes the visceral layer of Bowman&#8217;s capsule.The cells of each layer later differentiate.The cells surrounding the glomerulus begin to change.Now we have a double layer of cells, with Bowman&#8217;s space in between.The cells along the visceral layer become thin, relative to the cells along the parietal layer.These cells eventually differentiate into podocytes, that form filtration slits that mediate ultrafiltration of plasma.The GlomerulusThe afferent and efferent arterioles form a tremendous number of branches that anastamose with one another, at the glomerulus.This results in a a significant increase in surface area, which aids in filtration.Histology of the Renal CorpuscleThe branched, convoluted structure of the glomerulus is in the centre of the renal corpuscle.The nuclei in the glomerulus are from endothelial cells.The cavity is Bowman&#8217;s space (the urinary space).You can see the parietal layer and the visceral layer of Bowman&#8217;s capsule.There are two poles of the renal corpuscle.The Vascular Pole &#8594; this is where the afferent arteriole enters, and the efferent arteriole leaves.The Urinary Pole, where the filtrate leaves Bowman&#8217;s space, and enters the proximal convoluted tubule.The visceral layer of Bowman&#8217;s capsule have differentiated into podocytes that play a key role in filtration.Near the junction of the afferent and efferent arteriole, we have the distal convoluted tubule (because the renal tubule reflects back to the glomerulus).In this area is where the juxtaglomerulus apparatus is, which as we said before, consists of:Components of the Juxtaglomerular ApparatusMacula Densa of the Thick Ascending LimbSenses the ionic content of the tubular fluid, and can act on granular cells to change renin levels.Extraglomerular Mesangial CellsJuxtaglomerular Cells/Granular CellsStore and release renin, which is involved in the RAAS system.This makes physiological sense &#8594; it lets us assess blood pressure directly via vascular stretch (by the glomerular vascular bed) and indirectly via urine ion flow (by the macula densa).In response to decreased stretch or low ion flow (suggestive of fluid loss), the RAAS System kicks in, via the release of renin.Poles of the Renal CorpuscleVascular Pole &#8594; at the afferent and efferent arterioles.Urinary Pole &#8594; where the filtrate leaves Bowman&#8217;s capsule and enters the proximal convoluted tubuleThe above image shows the relationship between the podocytes and the capillaries of the glomerulus.The capillaries are lined by endothelial cells.These endothelial cells are fenestrated &#8594; they have holes in them. This helps fluid leave the vasculature.Filtration is further mediated by a high pressure gradient, which arises from the fact that the capillaries originate from an arteriole.Recall that arterioles can modulate their pressure damping by contricting or dilating their smooth muscle.By dilating the afferent arterioles, a large pressure gradient can be generated across the capillary bed, which vastly increases the hydrostatic pressure.There is a double layer of basement membrane separating the vascular bed and Bowman&#8217;s space as well:Recall that all epithelial and endothelial cells have a basement membrane.This means that the membrane between the vasculature and Bowman&#8217;s space not only includes the basement membrane of the endothelium, but also the basement membrane of the podocytes!The podocytes themselves have many arms called primary processes.These primary processes then branch into secondary processes, also known as foot processes or pedicels.These secondary processes interweave, forming a mesh for filtration.The slits between these secondary processes are called filtration slits.These filtration slits contain special proteins that help keep the podocytes in place.RememberSecondary processes = foot processes = pedicels.Podocyte BranchingPodocyte &#8594; primary process &#8594; secondary processes.The secondary processes interweave to form a filter, with slits called filtration slits.This filtration layer is kept in place by adhesion molecules and the basement membrane:Integrin &#945;3&#946;1 helps attach the foot processes to the double layered basement membrane.Patients with mutations in these integrins, or autoimmune diseases targeting the integrins, will cause the pedicels to lift off.This interferes with filtration, causing kidney dysfunction.Nephrin binds itself and forms the filtration slit diaphragm that keeps the foot processes in place.Again, as was mentioned in the Functional Anatomy of the Kidney lecture, mutations in nephrin result in the absence of filtration slits and the development of congenital nephrotic syndrome.This causes severe proteinuria and disseminated edema.The Basement Membrane is the main structure of filtration.Anything that wants to pass from the vasculature into the urinary space has to get through the basement membrane!Filtration by the basement membrane is by size and by charge.Anything larger than 70 kD is filtered out.Anything negatively charged is filtered out, because of the presence of negatively charged proteins in the basement membrane.Charge filtration is especially important when filtering out albumin, as it&#8217;s around 70 kD. Urine albumin is often used as a marker of kidney function!Components of the Filtration BarrierIntegrin &#8594; helps keep the foot processes attached to the basement membrane.Nephrin &#8594; helps keep the foot processes together, to maintain the filtration slit diaphragm.Basement Membrane &#8594; filters stuff by size and charge.The glomerulus is held together by intraglomerular mesangial cells.Note that these are different from the extraglomerular mesangial cells that are part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.These intraglomerular mesangial cells have many functions &#8594; their main one is cleaning of the filtration barrier.Intraglomerular mesangial cells are highly phagocytic.They constantly phagocytose the filtration barrier &#8594; they effectively function as a filter cleaner.With glomerulonephritis (acute inflammation of the kidney due to an immune response), our immune system can attack molecules that are on the mesangial cell surface.When these cells are under attack, they cannot effectively clean the filtration barrier, increasing the risk of infection and inflammation.The immune response can also target pedicels, or the basement membrane, which can also lead to inflammation and renal dysfunction.RememberIntraglomerular Mesangial Cells are not the same as extraglomerular mesangial cells, and function to clean the filtration barrier via their phagocytic activity.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/08/histology-kidney.html"},
	{"title": "Embryology of the Kidney", "text": "Kidney Embryology NotesSee Kidney Embryology Notes.Lecture ObjectivesOrigins of urogenital &#38; nephrogenic ridges.Define terms.Describe role of ureteric bud &#38; metanephric mesoderm.List derivatives of bud and mesoderm.Ascent of kidney and blood supply.Formation of bladder and urethra.Developmental anomalies.The Kidney in Early GestationThe above figure shows kidney development at 5 week gestation.There is a ridge of intermediate mesoderm, developing deep to the gut.This is retroperitoneal &#8594; deep to the peritoneal cavity.Anteriorly, you see the developing gut, which is attached to the posterior wall by the mesentery (which looks like a ligament).This ridge of intermediate mesoderm develops into the urogenital ridge &#8594; it&#8217;s comprised of urinary structures and genital structures.The lateral part forms the nephrogenic ridge.The medial part forms the genital ridge.The Urogenital RidgeThe lateral part forms the nephrogenic ridge (mesonephric Ridge).The medial part forms the genital ridge.If you take a cross-section of the ridge, you&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s shown on the right.The abdominal aorta will pass medially to the genital ridge, and lateral to the genital ridge will be the mesonephric ridge, where ducts will form.These ducts are rudimentary tubules that will form the glomerular structures.3 Pairs of kidneys begin formation about week 4:Pronephros &#8594; the first pair of kidneys.Mesonephros &#8594; the second pair of kidneys.Metanephros &#8594; the third pair of kidneys. Will develop into our final kidneys.Only the metanephros develops into the ultimate kidney, the rest degenerate.PronephrosRudimentary tubules and ducts form a set of nephrons which quickly degenerate by week 6.The duct is used by the mesonephros.Mesonephros: develops in the lumbar segments of the nephrogenic ridge, and has blood vessels.The cells differentiate to form tubules which associate with glomeruli.So this second kidney is actually a functional kidney.Starts to produce waste in the developing embryo until the ultimate kidney starts forming.There is a duct associated with it. Since the ridge is the mesonephric ridge, it&#8217;s named the mesonephric duct.This duct travels along the entire mesonephros, and opens all the way at the bottom, at the cloaca.The cloaca is a distal common sac &#8594; it&#8217;s a common reservoir where the deveoping gut and urinary system deposit stuff.The cloaca splits later in development.The mesonephros ultimately degenerates, except for the mesonephric duct, which becomes the vas deferens in the male, and a rudiment attachment in females.Metanephros: the ultimate kidney.To remember that the metanephros is the final kidney, remember that meso = middle, so the mesonephros is the &#8216;middle&#8217; kidney.The metanephros develops from two origins &#8594; the uretic bud and the metanephric mesoderm.It actually develops near the pelvic area, since the uretic bud is at the distal end of the mesonephric ridge.However, the final kidney is near the lumbar region, so the metanephros has to move during development.Kidneys in DevelopmentPronephros &#8594; the first pair of kidneys. Degenerate by week 6.Mesonephros &#8594; the second pair of kidneys. Degenerates except for the mesonephric duct, which becomes the vas deferens in males.Metaneprhos &#8594; the third pair of kidneys, that&#8217;ll develop into our final kidneys. Arises from a ureteric bud and a metanephrogenic mass.Anatomy of the MesonephrosAn image of the mesonephric ridge, and the uretic bud.The little tubular structures along the mesonephric duct eventually form glomeruli.The common sac at the bottom is the cloaca.The small bud near the distal end of the mesonephric duct is actually the uretic bud &#8594; this eventually gives rise to the metanephros, along with the metanephric mesoderm.The developing MetanephrosHere you see that the uretic bud is near the distal end of the mesonephric duct, as said before.The metanephric mesoderm attaches to the ureteric bud.These two ultimately form different components of the adult kidney.When these two components fail to communicate, we have abnormal development.The allantois is a tube that travels from the cloaca to the yolk sac and umbilical cord.As the fetus develops:The ureteric bud starts lengthening &#8594; ureter.The metanephrogenic mass starts getting bigger &#8594; kidney.The common cloaca will partition, via a urorectal septum.If the cloaca fails to partition, you will have urine and faeces depositing into the same area.If the allantois fails to close, you can have a continuation of the bladder into the umbilicus &#8594; you&#8217;ll pee out of your belly button!The &#8216;Relative&#8217; Ascent of the MetanephrosThe movement of the metanephros up the body is called relative ascent.It&#8217;s described as relative because the metanephros doesn&#8217;t actually move up &#8594; it&#8217;s more that the rest of the body moves down.More specifically, the pelvic region grows faster, and the ureter extends.The gonads are pulled down by the gubernaculum &#8594; a fibrous band that&#8217;s anchored to the developing gonadal ridge.As the kidneys ascend they receive their blood supply from the branches off the dorsal artery that are closest to them.In normal situations, the more caudal branches off the dorsal aorta simply degenerate, as they are not needed anymore as the kidney is moving up.If these branches fail to degenerate, then you end up with multiple blood vessels feeding the kidney &#8594; this is actually a pretty common thing to see!Here is an angiogram and a scan showing two renal arteries feeding the left kidney. This is caused by a failure of one of the branches of the dorsal aorta to degenerate.The Metanephric Mesoderm and the Ureteric BudAs we said before, the metanephros arises from the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesoderm.The ureteric bud gives rise to the ureter and the collecting regions of the kidney (the renal pelvis, calices, etc).The metanephric mesoderm gives rise to the cortex, where all the nephrons are.Progenitors of the MetanephrosUreteric Bud &#8594; gives rise to the ureter and collecting regions of the kidneyMetanephric Mesoderm &#8594; gives rise to the cortex, especially the nephrons.Functioning of the Metanephros in DevelopmentFetal kidneys are actively producing urine by 3 months.Adds volume to the amniotic fluid, helping to maintain sufficient fluid levels in the amniotic sac.You need an appropriate level of amniotic fluid to ensure that the baby is floating around properly.Low levels of amniotic fluid (recall, oligohydramnios), may be suggestive of a kidney problem.However, note that removal of waste products is still carried out by placenta.RememberLevels of amniotic fluid are suggestive of kidney problems &#8594; oligohydramnios suggests renal problems.Development of the Ureter and BladderAs we said before, the uro-rectal septum has to divide the cloaca into an ano-rectal sinus and a urogenital sinus.Sinus = enlarged tube.The urogenital sinus is split into 3 portions. Proximally to distally, they are:Vesical portion &#8594; gives rise to the bladder.Pelvic portion &#8594; sphincter area of the bladder and the urethra.Phallic portion &#8594; component of the urethra that extends into the genitalia.Division of the CloacaThe cloaca is divided by the uro-rectal septum into:The ano-rectal sinus.The urogenital sinus.Vesical portion &#8594; bladder.Pelvic portion &#8594; sphincter area of bladder and the urethra. It forms part of the male urethra, and most of the female urethra.Phallic portion &#8594; urethra that extends into the genitalia.As the bladder enlarges the ureter openings are also incorporated into its walls forming the trigone &#8594; the triangular area at the bottom of the bladder.The ureters attach at an angle to prevent backflow into the kidneys.If the ureters attach to the bladder at too straight of an angle, or if they don&#8217;t attach deep enough, there will be retrograde urine flow.The conversion of the allantois into the median umbilical ligament is similar to how the ductus arteriosus shrivels into the ligamentum arteriosum during development.The allantois becomes a thick fibrous tube, known as the urachus, connecting the bladder to the anterior abdominal wall.After birth the urachus becomes the median umbilical ligament.RememberAllantois &#8594; urachus &#8594; medial umbilical ligament.Developmental Abnormalities1. A Double UreterOccurs when we have two ureteric buds forming from the mesonephric bud.Could also occur when a single ureteric bud divides.This is pretty common, and is typically asymptomatic &#8594; wouldn&#8217;t require any surgical intervention.Other developmental abnormalities include:Pelvic Kidney &#8594; one kidney fails to ascend properly, and gets stuck in the pelvis.Unilateral double kidney &#8594; two kidneys on one side.2. Renal AgenesisHere, the kidney doesn&#8217;t develop.One cause of renal agenesis would be if there&#8217;s no ureteric bud, so there&#8217;s no induction of the mesoderm to form metanephric mesoderm.As a result, we don&#8217;t have a metanephric mass.Since we require both the ureteric bud and the metanephric mass, problems in either can result in agenesis.3. Horseshoe KidneyBoth kidneys develop, but as they begin to ascend, the two lower poles of the kidney merge.Because the two kidneys join, this horseshoe kidney typically fails to complete its ascent, and will typically be found in the pelvic region.4. Polycystic KidneyPatients with a polycystic kidney will present with engorged kidneys with large cysts.On x-ray, they can be seen to be large, and lobular.The most common etiology of a polycystic kidney is polycystic kidney disease, which is a genetic disease.There are also developmental etiologies for a polycystic kidney.For instance, it can also happen if the ureter does not become canalized, and is never patent.So the kidney will be producing urine, but this urine have no place to go, because the ureters aren&#8217;t open.As a result, it&#8217;ll back up, and form these huge kidney cysts.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/07/embryology-kidney.html"},
	{"title": "Functional Anatomy of the Kidney", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesList 4 basic functions of the kidney.Identify the basic anatomical features of the kidney.Describe the different parts of the glomerulus and nephron segments in their proper order.Describe the direction of blood flow to and from the nephron.Explain to your non-medical friends why urine is yellow.Key functions of the KidneyIon Regulation &#38; Osmoregulation &#8594; balancing salt levels in blood and body fluids (Na+ and K+) and maintaining proper levels of total body waterWaste Management &#8594; Removal of waste products that would otherwise be toxic (e.g. urea, H+)Hormone Production &#8594; Kidneys are also endocrine glands that produce many different hormones (they produce EPO, and activate Vitamin D).Gluconeogenesis &#8594; Kidneys can synthesize sugar for the brain in times of starvation (normally, the liver does most gluconeogenesis).Kidney AnatomyGross Kidney AnatomyThe outer layer is the cortex.This is where you have almost all your glomeruli &#8594; a network of capillaries where filtration occurs.Blood enters the glomeruli through an afferent arteriole, and exits through an efferent arteriole.Only a few glomeruli are in the medulla.The deeper layer is the medulla.This is where the renal tubules are located.The renal tubules are where the urine is formed and modified.The NephronThe nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. It&#8217;s basically a hollow tube.This is where filtration of the blood occurs.Filtered substances are either reabsorbed or excretedThe end product is urine.Filtration is regulated by the endocrine and nervous system.Filtration occurs across the renal tubule.Components of the Renal Tubule include:Proximal convoluted tubule.Descending loop of Henle.Thick ascending loop of Henle.Distal convoluted tubule.Microscopic View of the NephronTo the right is a normal kidney biopsy.Proximal tubules have a thick epithelium &#8594; lots of energy there to drive a ton of transporters. This is where 80% of glomerular filtrate reabsorption occurs.Distal Tubules have a thin epithelium &#8594; less metabolically active.RememberProximal Tubules have a thick epithelium.Distal Tubules have a thin epithelium.Renal Blood FlowThe kidneys actually receive more blood flow per kilogram than any other organ.Human renal flow accounts for around 20-25% of the total cardiac output.This is heavily biased towards the cortex &#8594; the medulla is actually a low flow environment.This has consequences when you have hypotension (eg. with sepsis):There&#8217;s a risk of acute kidney failure, because the renal tubules are already in a shitty, low flow environment (in the medulla).As a result, there can be tubular necrosis, and acute kidney injury.Key PointsThe kidney gets more flow/kg than any other organ.There&#8217;s much more flow in the cortex than in the medulla, so the medulla has a disproportionately higher risk of ischemia.The Kidney Vascular SystemRenal Artery.Interlobar Artery.Arcuate Artery.Interlobular Artery.Afferent Arteriole &#8594; entering the glomerulus.Glomerular capillaries &#8594; where filtration occurs.Efferent Arteriole &#8594; leaving the glomerulus.Peritubular CapillariesVasa Recta &#8594; the blood vessels that surround the nephron, which allow for stuff to be reabsorbed or secreted from the renal tubule.NotesNote that the capillary bed after the glomerulus is what&#8217;s referred to as the peritubular capillary system.So blood flow moves from the afferent arteriole &#8594; efferent arteriole &#8594; peritubular capillary system.The portion of the peritubular capillary system that surrounds the loop of Henle is called the vasa recta.These anatomical features can be seen in microscopy as well. The glomeruli are the &#39;ball like shapes&#39;, and the vasa recta capillaries streak down into the medulla, along the renal tubules.Urine FormationThe first step in urine formation begins with the ultrafiltration of plasma across the glomerular capillaries.This results in the passive movement of protein-free fluid from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman&#8217;s space.Bowman&#8217;s Space &#8594; the space which receives fluid from the glomerulus.Bowman&#8217;s Capsule &#8594; the entire sac, which encapsulates the glomerulus.Renal Corpuscle = glomerulus + Bowman&#8217;s capsule.Why is protein not normally filtered into Bowman&#8217;s space?Normal urine contains little or no protein. Why is this the case?There are two reasons:Size Barrier &#8594; protein can&#8217;t fit through the sieve.Charge Barrier &#8594; the glomerular basement membrane is negatively charged. The key protein in blood, albumin, is also negatively charged, restricting flow out.To the right is a histologic image of a glomerulus.Bowman&#8217;s Capsule &#8594; the sac surrounding the glomerulus.Bowman&#8217;s Space &#8594; seen as a gap between the outside of the capsule and the glomerulus.Glomerular Capillary Loop &#8594; seen as the smaller loops within the glomerulus.What lines Bowman&#8217;s Capsule?The endothelial cells of the glomerular capillaries are surrounded by podocytes.The podocytes have long finger like processes that completely encircle the outer part of the capillaries called foot processes.The foot processes are separated by gaps called filtration slits.These components form the filtration barrier, which, as described before, is comprised of:Size barrier &#8594; size filtration of big proteins.Charge barrier &#8594; the above components are negatively charged, preventing negatively charged proteins from moving through.Clinicopathologic CorrelationNephrin is a protein that is a major component of the filtration slits.Mutations in the nephrin gene lead to abnormal or absent filtration slits and the development of congenital nephrotic syndrome &#8594; massive proteinuria, eventual end-stage kidney disease.They&#8217;re effectively born with an inability to keep protein in &#8594; they keep peeing it out.On physical exam, you see peripheral edema, and scrotal edema, due to fluid exudation with reduced oncotic pressure.The Juxtaglomerular ApparatusThe Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA) consists of:The macula densa of the thick ascending limb.Note that the thick ascending limb passes back near the glomerulus &#8594; this is where the macula densa are.Here, they sense changes in ionic content, which in response, can trigger changes in renin levels.Hence, the location of the macula densa makes sense &#8594; they&#8217;re in the thick ascending limb so that they&#8217;ll be near the juxtaglomerular apparatus, where they can act on renin producing cells.The extraglomerular mesangial cells.Their role is not well understood, but it&#8217;s hypothesized that they&#8217;re associated with EPO secretion.The renin producing granular cells of the afferent arteriole.Granular cells are also known as juxtaglomerular cells &#8594; these are modified smooth muscle cells that store and synthesize renin.Recall from Heart &amp; Circulation that renin mediates the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I in the RAAS system.Components of the Juxtaglomerular ApparatusMacula Densa of the Thick Ascending LimbSenses the ionic content of the tubular fluid, and can act on granular cells to change renin levels.Extraglomerular Mesangial CellsJuxtaglomerular Cells/Granular CellsStore and release renin, which is involved in the RAAS system.Renin release is mediated by two mechanisms.Hypotension, detected by stretch receptors in the walls of the afferent arterioles.Low ion flow (Na, Cl), detected by the macula densa.Triggers for Renin ReleaseHypotension, detected by stretch receptors in the afferent arterioles.Low flow of Na, Cl, detected by the macula densa.The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone SystemAngiotensin II increases symphathetic activity, stimulates aldosterone production from the adrenals, directly vasoconstricts, stimulates production of ADH, and increases resorption of free water from collecting ducts.Recall that ACE inhibitors block conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II.This can actually be somewhat dangerous when you have acute fluid loss, where the RAAS would typically compensate.For instance, if you have &#8216;the shits&#8217; (diarrhea), nausea, or vomiting, you should hold off your ACEI, or you may be at risk for hypotensive episodes and acute injury!Functions of the KidneyUrine production maintains homeostasis by:Regulating blood volume and compositionExcreting waste products:UreaCreatinineUric acidUrea, creatinine, and uric acid are not toxins themselves, but can be used to give an estimate of toxins in the blood, which we cannot detect.Creatine, which is taken by body builders, is converted to creatinine, so if you have a patient that takes workout supplements, they may have a &#8216;false&#8217; high creatinine.With unhealthy kidneys, you have a build-up of these waste products, which is called uremia.The associated symptoms caused by uremia are known as uremic syndrome.Uremic SyndromeThe signs and symptoms associated with uremia &#8594; build-up of waste products.Complications of Uremic Syndrome1. Cardiovascular ComplicationsHypertension.CHF, LVH &#8594; the most common cardiac consequence is LV hypertrophy.Arrythmias &#8594; with hyperkalemia.CAD, vascular disease.2. Gastrointestinal SystemAnorexia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, uremic fetor.Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are the most common GI problems.Uremic fetor &#8594; a sulfur-like breath smell, due to uremic toxins. Very distinct odour.Stomatitis, gastritis, enteritis.Altered mucosal barriers with gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD).Most common GI problem, anorexia, nausea, vomiting.3. AnemiaErythropoietin deficiency, since it&#8217;s produced in kidney interstitial cells.Iron, folate, B12 deficiencies, because of impaired absorption from the gut (Recall Blood)!Bone Marrow fibrosis from hyperparathyroidism, which causes calcium resorption.This fibrosis affects the bone marrow&#8217;s ability to produce RBCs.4. HemostasisIncreased bleeding tendency from impaired platelets.Not only is their function impaired, but Thrombopoietin is also produced in the kidneys (as well as the liver).5. Immune ResponseImpaired humoral and cellular immunity.Impaired function of PMNs.Moderate lymphopenia, impaired lymphocytes .Reduced helper cell activity.Hypocomplementemia.6. Neurological SystemNeurological of Cardiac complications are usually the ones that can kill you instantly.Of the neurological complications, the most dangerous ones are comas and seizures.Apathy, fatigue, confusion, hallucinations, anxiety, coma .Myoclonic seizures.Nightmares, insomnia.Sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy.Autonomic neuropathy.7. Metabolic AcidosisRecall that this occurs because the kidney fails to secrete acids from the blood.This results in metabolic acidosis.8. Endocrine DisordersGlucose intolerance (Diabetes).Increased triglycerides (Hyperlipidemia).Decreased protein synthesis, catabolism, malnourishment.Disturbances in menstruation and fertility, impotence.If a female patient is put on dialysis, birth control is often suggested &#8594; fetal outcomes are poor in patients with kidney failure.In men, impotence is very common.9. IntegumentPallor, ecchymoses, pruritus, pigmentation, and dry skin.The itchiness is caused by uremic toxins.Uremic frost (pictured) &#8594; this is where urea crystals precipitate on the skin! It actually looks like frost!This isn&#8217;t seen much anymore because of the wide availability of dialysis in Canada.Most patients don&#8217;t progress this far!10. Musculoskeletal ProblemsOsteitis Fibrosa Cystica, also known as Renal Osteodystrophy.This is caused by erosions into the bone due to a hyperactive parathyroid.This hyperactive parathyroid is triggered by increased phosphate and decreased calcium.RememberOne musculoskeletal complication of uremic syndrome is osteitis fibrosa cystica, aka. renal osteodystrophy.It&#8217;s caused by a hyperactive parathyroid causing calcium re-absorption.In detail, Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica/Renal Osteodystrophy arises from:Inability to excrete phosphorus &#8594; phosphate increases.Inability to activate Vitamin D via 1-hydroxylation &#8594; calcium decreases.Recall that 1-hydroxylation is the second activation step, which occurs in the kidneys.Without Vitamin D, calcium can&#8217;t be absorbed from the small intestine, so calcium levels fall.As a result of decreased calcium and increased phosphate, the parathyroid glands increases their activity, causing calcium resorption from bone.This is what causes the bony erosions!We often give patients with chronic kidney disease activated Vitamin D to prevent this from happening.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/07/functional-anatomy-kidney.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction &amp; Case of the Week", "text": "Course OverviewExam questions mimic small group questions very closely.5 modules where you&#8217;re given charts and you have to work out a patient case.Free manuals &#8594; nephrology and urology. The material isn&#8217;t examinable, but helps you understand the material.Treat it as a textbook &#8594; only use it if you don&#8217;t understand the materials.Assignment &#8594; 10 clinical cases. Answer in point form &#8594; be concise! Due at the end of 4th week.Midterm on first 3 weeks of material &#8594; 50 MC, 5 short answers (each 10 marks) = 100 marks.Final exam will include everything, and won&#8217;t be more heavily weighted towards the last 2 weeks of material.Won&#8217;t be examined on anatomy or embryology on the final exam, because there&#8217;s an anatomy exam.Case PresentationCase Summary80 yr old man with known chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy, presents to the Emergency Room with a 3 hour history of nausea and vomiting with hematemesis.He is severely short of breath. He is initiated on oxygen therapy and a two large bore IV lines are placed.Bloodwork, ECG and a CXR are sent off stat.Shortly after he arrives, his vital signs become absent and despite. vigorous attempts to save his life, he passes away.The autopsy report states that the patient passed away from complications of kidney disease.Hemoptysis = coughing up blood.Hematemesis = vomiting up blood.Typically don&#8217;t see falls in sodium until you&#8217;re in very late stages of kidney failure &#8594; will often present with CNS complications.If your kidneys don&#8217;t pee out sodium, shouldn&#8217;t it be high?It&#8217;s actually very difficult to increase blood sodium via ingestion because oncotic pressure pulls salt in.However, with kidney failure, you&#8217;re unable to free out free water, meaning you have hyponatremia.This causes fluid overload, which can cause cerebral failure!RememberWith late-stage kidney failure, you end up with hyponatremia.You also develop hyperkalemia due to ineffective elimination &#8594; one of the most dangerous complications of renal failure.This can cause cardiac arrythmias because of a change in threshold potential.RememberHyperkalemia is one of the biggest causes of medical emergencies with renal failure, because is can cause arrythmias.Chloride usually matches sodium, not too important clinically.Bicarbonate falls in renal failure! Why?Metabolic Acidosis.Kidney loses ability to excrete acids in blood, and you become acidotic.Since enzyme function is highly pH dependent, this can be very dangerous!Why does the patient have low albumin?Dysfunctional glomeruli can cause proteinuria, resulting in albumin leakage.Fatigue and poor-appetite due to renal failure can result in protein malnutrition as well!Note that the liver produces albumin, so production should be normal.Why are calcium levels low?The kidney and the liver are the two organs that activate Vitamin D.Vitamin D absorbs calcium from the gut into the bloodstream, and must be activated before it can function.The first hydroxylation, 25-hydroxylation &#8594; occurs in the liver.The second hydroxylation, 1-hydroxylation, occurs in the kidney.With kidney failure, the second reaction can&#8217;t happen, meaning that calcium is poorly absorbed.Why are Phosphate Levels high?Failure to excrete phosphate.In extreme situations, this can call metabolic complications.High phosphate coupled with low calcium can lead to parathyroid hyperplasia, resulting in calcium resorption from the bones &#8594; fragile bones.Why is the patient anemic?The interstitial cells in the kidney secrete EPO (recall blood).So without EPO, we have a reduction in erythrocyte production!RememberVitamin D must be activated before it can help absorb calcium from the gut. This activation relies on 2 steps.25-hydroxylation in the liver.1-hydroxylation in the kidney.Lab Findings with Renal FailureNa &#8595; in late-stage renal failure.K &#8593; due to ineffective elimination. Can cause arrythmias.HCO3 &#8595; &#8594; metabolic acidosis.Ca &#8595; &#8594; 1-hydroxylation of Vitamin D occurs in the kidney. Vitamin D helps resorb calcium from the gut.Albumin &#8595; &#8594; damaged glomeruli cause proteinuria.Phosphate &#8593; &#8594; ineffective elimination.Anemia &#8594; decrease in EPO, made by interstitial cells in the kidney.Is this Respiratory or Metabolic Acidosis?Bicarbonate levels low suggesting primary cause is metabolic acidosis.PCO2 is low, because of compensatory respiratory alkalosis.Urinalysis by urine dip stick shows elevated blood and protein in the urine.This is often one of the first signs we have of kidney failure.Pulmonary EdemaPatient has pulmonary edema as well, due to fluid overload.In normal patients, this would be treated with a loop diuretic like Lasix (furosemide), to cause them to urinate out the extra fluid.However, in patients with kidney failure, this obviously doesn&#8217;t work as well!So pulmonary edema in a patient with kidney failure is often an indication for dialysis because there&#8217;s often no alternative in treating it.ECG FindingsPeaked T-Waves are seen in patients with hyperkalemia.This makes sense &#8594; repolarization is mediated by a potassium influx, so with increased potassium, you would have a stronger repolarization.A peaked T-wave is defined as a T-wave that is 2/3rds the height of the QRS complex.In this ECG, the T-wave is actually higher than the QRS!The wide QRS (suggestive of ventricular tachycardia), and wide QT, mean that the patient is at risk for Torsades. Dangerous!RememberPeaked T-Waves are suggestive of hyperkalemia.LV HypertrophyOn autopsy, you see LV hypertropy due to increased preload caused by an increase in fluid causing hypertension.Similarly, almost 100% of patients on dialysis will have LV hypertrophy, due to fluid overload.Kidney AtrophyScarring can lead to kidney atrophy.The normal kidney size is between 9-12 cm.If the kidney gets down to 6 cm, it&#8217;s often suggestive of chronic nephropathy.Severe CachexiaCachexia often occurs, because the patient refuses to go on dialysis.This causes them to slowly become malnourished, cachectic.This decision is often made for QoL reasons &#8594; they don&#8217;t want to be constantly hooked up to a machine.Renal failure is actually a very peaceful way to die &#8594; uremic toxins are like a bolus of morphine &#8594; you pass away gently.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/genitourinary/2014/04/07/intro-case-week.html"},
