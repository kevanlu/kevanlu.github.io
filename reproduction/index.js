Introduction  Unlike the testis, which aims to produce a ton of spermatozoa, the ovary aims for quality, and not quantity.          Over a lifetime, a woman may only ovulate a few hundred times, so those oocytes must be good.        Hence, the ovary places a huge selection pressure on the ovarian follicle, to ensure that only those oocytes with a high developmental competence are released.  Aside      “The oocyte that you are derived from developed in your mother’s ovary while she was developing in your grandmother’s uterus”.              Since your environment has a profound influence on gamete development, your grandmother can actually directly influence the ‘health’ of your oocyte!            Anatomy &amp; Oogenesis  The ovary consists of stroma tissue, germ cells, and accessory cells.  Most of the stromal tissue is connective tissue and fibroblasts, but it also contains circular ‘container’ structures known as follicles.          Each ovum lies within a follicle.      Meiosis in these ova is arrested is arrested at Meiosis I → it only resumes when ovulation occurs.      It’s the mid-cycle LH surge that triggers ovulation, and the resumption of meiosis.        Only a small part of the mature follicle is actually released during ovulation; the rest persists in the ovary and becomes the corpus luteum.          The part of the follicle that is released along with the ovum is comprised of cumulus cells, which are specialized granulosa cells.      The remaining corpus luteum produces very high levels of progesterone, which prepares the uterus for implantation.        The corpus luteum only persists for 2 weeks if the oocyte isn’t fertilized.  This is why β-HCG testing is used for pregnancy. The test involves using an antibody specific to the β subunit of the hCG protein.          If the oocyte is fertilized, it will release a specific hormone that ‘tells’ the corpus luteum to persist → this hormone is hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin).      If the oocyte is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will regress into what’s known as the corpus albicans.        The ovary is only loosely tethered to the fallopian tubes by fimbrae.          During ovulation, the oocyte is actually chucked out into free space, directed only by fluid flows created by the fimbrae.      Folliculogenesis  The primordial follicle is sleeping; there’s little biological activity.  Via some as-of-yet-unknown stimulation, this primordial follicle is activated to become a primary follicle.          A primary follicle is defined as an oocyte that is surrounded by one layer of granulosa cells.        When more than one layer of granulosa cells form around the oocyte, then the follicle is referred to as a secondary follicle.          Follicle maturation can progress to this stage without the influence of the hypothalamus or pituitary, and hence do not require gonadotropin action.      However, all subsequent steps require the action of FSH.        With the action of FSH, the follicle further develops such that (1) a cell layer forms outside the granulosa, and (2) a fluid-filled cavity forms within the granulosa. It is then known as a tertiary follicle.          The outside cell layer is known as the theca.                  The theca cells of this new theca layer are the female equivalent of the leydig cells → they produce androgens in response to LH stimulation.                    The inner fluid-filled cavity is known as the antrum.                  Formation of the antrum requires FSH stimulation of the granulosa cells.          The granulosa cells are the female equivalent of sertoli cells → they form an antrum in response to FSH stimulation.                      The final stage of follicular development is known as the Graafian follicle (aka. pre-ovulatory follicle, mature follicle). This can be very large, up to 2 cm in size.  Throughout folliculogenesis, the oocyte remains arrested at diplotene of Meiosis I.          In other words, while the oocyte is in the follicle, Meiosis is inhibited.      Meiosis only resumes with ovulation, in response to an LH surge.        Remember      Theca cells are the female equivalent of leydig cells → they produce androgens in response to LH stimulation.    Granulosa cells are the female equivalent of sertoli cells → they form an antrum in response to FSH stimulation.  Oocyte Maturation  Meiosis is arrested at diplotene (a part of Prophase I) in Meiosis I, while the oocyte is in the follicle.          This applies to all of the oocytes that a woman has.        Upon ovulation, Meiosis I is completed asymmetrically, resulting in the formation of a 2n oocyte and a polar body. Meiosis is then arrested again at Metaphase II  Meiosis is only completed upon fertilization of the oocyte by a spermatozoa, resulting in the ejection of another polar body, and a 1n chromosomal complement.          Technically speaking, the oocyte is never really fully haploid, because ejection of the polar body occurs after fertizilation, when the spermatozoa’s DNA is there too.         Summary Oocyte Maturation Arrest      There are 2 points where oocyte maturation is arrested, at diplotene of Prophase I, and at Metaphase II.                               Prophase I (Diplotene)        Metaphase II                            When?        While the oocyte is still in the follicle.        After ovulation, but before fertilization.                    What triggers resumption of Meiosis?        Ovulation (LH)        Fertilization                    Chromosomal Complement        4n        2n              Oocyte numbers peak during fetal development and then fall until they’re completely gone.  Menopause occurs when oocyte numbers are depleted.  Most follicles that begin to develop neither progress to become a Graafian follicle, nor become ovulated.          These follicles, which fail to survive against strong negative selection pressures, then become atretic follicles.      Ovarian follicle atresia describes the degeneration, apoptosis, and eventual reabsorption of failed follicles.        This process repeats every month → a cohort of secondary follicles is selected, and over the course of time, one follicle becomes dominant, and the rest undergo atresia.Chemistry and Secretion of Steroid Hormones  This is almost exactly the same as what we saw last lecture with Male Reproductive Physiology, but with one key difference.          Instead of stopping at Testosterone (which, as we recall, was converted from Androstenedione by 17-β-HSD), we have an additional conversion to estradiol.      This is mediated by Aromatase, which catalyzes the conversion of:                  Testosterone to Estradiol.          Estrone to Estradiol.                    In other words, Aromatose converts androgens to estrogens.        How is ovarian steroidogenesis regulated?          This is conceptually very similar to what we saw in the testis.      The theca cell (the female analog of the leydig cell) produces androgens in response to LH. The androgen that is produced is mainly androstenedione, and it’s used for aromatization.      Aromatization itself occurs in the granulosa cells (the female analog of the Sertoli Cell), in respone to FSH.                  Aromatase immediately converts estrone into estradiol.          FSH stimulation is indirect; rather than increasing the aromatase activity per cell, FSH actually increases the number of cells by causing granulosa cell proliferation.                    Just like in the testis, both of these actions are mediated by cAMP.        The corpus luteum also produces estradiol, under the influence of LH.Release, Transportation, and Inactivation  This is also very similar to what we saw with Male Reproductive Physiology.  Plasma binding proteins differ for estradiol and progesterone.          For estradiol, (1) albumin and (2) SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) are the primary binding proteins, just like with testosterone.      For progesterone, (1) albumin and (2) CBG (Cortisol Binding Globulin) are the primary binding proteins.        Unlike testosterone, neither estradiol nor progesterone require conversion to a more active form (eg. DHT).  Estradiol is required to induce progesterone receptors:Endocrine Regulation of the Ovarian Cycle  In males and females, hypothalamic GnRH triggers the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary.  The targets of LH and FSH differ between males and females, as discussed before:          In males LH targets Leydig cells; in females LH targets Theca cells.      In males FSH targets Sertoli cells; in females FSH targets Granulosa cells.        Negative feedback in females is much more complicated:          In males, we saw that LH was inhibited by testosterone, and FSH was inhibited by inhibin.      In females, FSH regulation isn’t as simple → unlike in the male, where FSH is not very useful, and can be kept at low levels, FSH is critical in the female.                  Hence, FSH regulation becomes a much more complex process, where inhibin plays a less clear role.                    Hormone Regulation During the Ovarian Cycle  The length of the ovarian cycle can vary wildly, both between different women, and within the same woman.          This difference is at the follicular phase, which means that it’s often difficult to predict when you’ll ovulate.        Progesterone rises during the luteal phase:          Progesterone is made in the follicular phase as well, but it’s quickly converted to estradiol because the follicle is still growing and its granulosa cells are causing aromatization.      Once ovulation occurs, the follicle is converted to the corpus luteum.                  Now, since aromatization decreases, not all of the progesterone that’s produced by the corpus luteum can be converted.          Hence, the corpus luteum will release progesterone.                      FSH is high at the beginning of the cycle, and then falls during the follicular phase:          This is because FSH is necessary for the progression of folliculogenesis.      However, as the follicle becomes larger, FSH actually declines. This is due to negative feedback by estradiol.                  Follicle growth → granulosa cell proliferation → increased aromatase activity → increased conversion to estradiol.          Hence, estradiol inhibits FSH secretion.                      FSH suddenly peaks at the end of the follicular phase:            Prolonged high levels of estradiol shift the negative feedback to a feed-forward response.                  This can be seen in the figure to the right, which was from an old experiment done on Rhesus monkeys.          Immediately upon estradiol injection, gonadotropin levels fall due to negative feedback.          But around 48h after injection, there is actually a surge in gonadotropin levels → this is the transition to the feed-forward response.                    Feed-Forward Response = positive feedback but with a time delay.      This leads to a huge surge of FSH and LH.                  LH release triggers ovulation, and allows for the oocyte to be un-arrested from diplotene.                      FSH Regulation in the Ovarian Cycle      FSH is high at the beginning of the cycle, in order to stimulate folliculogenesis past the secondary follicle.    FSH falls as the follicle grows, due to increased negative feedback by estradiol (which is produced due to increased aromatase activity).    FSH suddenly peaks at the end of the follicular phase, due to prolonged estradiol suppression leading to a transition to a feed-forward response.    Just prior to ovulation, the Granulosa cells will also express LH receptors          This is because the entire follicle (both the outer thecal layer, and the inner granulosa layer) needs to respond to LH in order for ovulation to occur.      This is shown in the image below → the bottom left cell reflects a granulosa cell just prior to ovulation.      Physiologic Effects of the Ovarian Steroids  Effects of Estradiol:          On non-sexual tissues:                  Estradiol accelerates linear bone growth and closure of the epiphysial plates.          In adults it supports osteoblast/osteocyte activity and prevents bone resorption (recall that this is because estradiol binds RANK-L).          Hepatic protein synthesis (especially SHBG, CBG, TBG) is stimulated by estrogen.                    On secondary sex characteristics:                  Estrogen stimulates fat deposition and growth of the duct systems of the breast.                    On secondary sex organs:                  There are effects on the Fallopian tubes, the uterus, cervix and vagina.          Estradiol is important in building up the endometrium.                      Effects of Progesterone:          On non-sexual tissues:                  Affects body temperature → this is why natural family planning based on basal body temperature works to a certain extent.                    On secondary sex characteristics:                  Progesterone promotes the development of the lobules and alveoli of the mammary glands.                    On the reproductive tract:                  Progesterone is important in maintaining/shedding the endometrium.                    Summary  Gonadal Hormone Regulation in Females      LH acts on the Theca Cells to increase the production of androgens, namely androstenedione.              Androstenedione can be converted to either Estrone or Testosterone, which can then be converted to Estradiol by Aromatase.              FSH acts on the Granulosa Cells to stimulate aromatase activity.              FSH is regulated in a somewhat complex fashion by estradiol → high estradiol causes negative feedback in the short-term, but this transitions to a feed-forward response after a time delay.                                         LH        FSH                            Acts on        Theca Cells        Granulosa Cells                    Mechanism of Action        Increased intracellular cAMP        Increased intracellular cAMP                    Effects        Increased Androstenedione synthesis        Increased Aromatase Activity              Make sure you compare this to the similar chart that was shown in the previous lecture.  You can also see it below:  Gonadal Hormone Regulation in Males      LH acts on the Leydig Cells to increase the activity of P450 Side Chain Cleavage.              This increases steroidogenesis, and ultimately, testosterone levels.        Testosterone then inhibits LH production.              FSH acts on the Sertoli Cells to stimulate a number of functions, including synthesis of ABP.              FSH also stimulates the production of Inhibin.

The difference arises in the effects of these hormones once they reach their end destination.      For this lecture, and the following lecture, focus on how LH and FSH differ in their effects and regulation.        FSH is more important in maintaining female function compared to male function.          In males, where FSH is undesired, FSH is severely inhibited by inhibins, which are produced in the testes.      Anatomy of the Testis  The key functional unit of the testis is the seminiferous tubule.          These are convoluted tubes which function like an ‘assembly line’ that constantly produces spermatozoa.        These spermatozoa then collect in the rete testis (shown right, at 6), which then feeds into Ductuli Efferents (aka. efferent ductules), which carry the spermatozoa out of the testis.  The spermatozoa then move through a long tortuous tubular structure called the epididymis.          When the spermatozoa first enter the epididymis, they are not yet motile → they must develop there for a period of time before they are functional.      The epididymis also functions as a warehouse → spermatozoa can lie in wait in it for up to two weeks (the amount of time varies depending on whether you’re in a ‘dry spell’ or not heh heh).        When the spermatozoa are ‘called to action’, they rapidly move out of the epididymis out into the vas deferens.          They then meet the prostate, seminal vesicles, etc, as we saw in Anatomy &amp; Development of the Male Genitalia.      Histology of the Testis  Above is a cross-section of a testis, cutting through multiple loops of a seminiferous tubule.  The Sertoli Cells are the epithelial cells that line the seminiferous tubule.  Between the Sertoli cells are spermatogenic cells at different stages of maturation.          Maturation occurs from the outside to the inside; the most mature spermatids are located in the lumen, and the least mature ones are at the periphery.        The Leydig Cells lie in the interstitial space, outside of the seminiferous tubules.  Remember      Sertoli Cells line the seminiferous tubules.    Leydig Cells lie in the interstitial space.    Spermatids are least developed at the periphery of the tubule, and are most developed at the lumen.  Spermatogenesis  Spermatozoa originate from primordial germ cells, which then develop into ‘committed’ spermatogonia.          These reside in the basolateral surface of the seminiferous tubule (away from the lumen).        Spermatogonia are still mitotically active → they only enter into meisosis once they become primary spermatocytes.          The transition to a primary spermatocyte is demarcated by a movement from the ‘outside compartment’ of the Sertoli cell into the ‘inside compartment’ of the Sertoli cell.      In other words, as the spermatogonia develops into a primary spermatocyte, it will cross the blood-testis barrier.        The blood-testis barrier is maintained by tight junctions between the Sertoli cells.  Once the primary spermatocyte get out of the blood-testis barrier, it becomes meiotically active.          In males, meiosis is symmetric. With the first meiotic division, you produce 2 secondary spermatocytes, and with the second meiotic division, you produce 4 spermatids.        After this, we have spermiogenesis, where these haploid spermatids are remodeled to become fusiform torpedos of terror.The Blood-Testis Barrier  How does the sister cell from the spermatogonia get through the tight junction and become a primary spermatocyte?          The tight junctions between the Sertoli cells actually break down and move.      There is a sequential formation and destruction of the tight junctions, to move cells out of the blood testis barrier.        When a spermatogonia breaks out of the blood-testis barrier, the tight junction in front of it breaks down, and another tight junction forms behind it.          This prevents exposure of other spermatogonia to the external environment (which results in a transition from mitosis to meiosis).        The blood-testis barrier allows for the maintenance of a basal compartment and an apical compartment.          As mentioned before, it’s thought that these different milieus maintain mitotic and meiotic activity respectively.      Spermiogenesis  How does a haploid spermatid become a spermatozoa?          An acrosomal vesicle forms:                  The golgi apparatus develops into something callled an acrosomal vesicle, which becomes the head of the spermatozoa.          This acrosomal vesicle contains proteolytic enzymes that are critical to penetrating the oocyte cell membrane.                    A flagellum forms:                  The flagellum is microtubule-dense, and grows from centromeres. Centromeres contain a complex called γ-TuRC that helps nucleate microtubules.                    Excess cytoplasm is discarded:                  This forms a residual body.                    Mitochondria localize to a mitochondrial sheath:                  Mitochondria collect near the start of the flagellum, and become encapsulated in a mitochondrial sheath.          These provide the ATP that is required for the flagellum to move.                    The haploid chromosomal component is tightly packed:                  Normally, DNA is wound in histones, which modulate gene expression.          However, since the DNA in a spermatozoa isn’t active, it can be packaged to save space.          So there are special DNA binding proteins called protamines, which replace the histones, and result in a very tight packing of the DNA.                    Pathologic Conditions Affecting Spermatogenesis  High Temperature (eg. body temperature) → spermatogenesis requires cooler-than-body temperatures to function optimally, which is why the testes are external.          In patients with cryptorchidism, descent of the testes fails, so the higher internal body temperatures will inhibit spermatogenesis.        Varicocele → abnormal dilation of the pampiniform venous plexus, affecting temperature regulation of the testes.  Chemotherapy → many chemo drugs inhibit components of cell division, thus affecting spermatogenesis.          Once chemotherapy has been stopped, dormant stem cells (which aren’t as mitotically active) can then repopulate the seminiferous tubules.        Mumps → in adults, will often cause acute orchitis (inflammation of the testes).  Testicular Torsion → disruption of blood supply due to physical trauma or abnormally mobile testis within the tunica vaginalis.Steroids and Steroidogenesis  Steroid → terpenoid lipid; carbon skeleton with 4 fused rings, generally arranged in a 6-6-6-5 fashion.          They differ in what functional groups are attached to these rings, and the oxidation state of the rings.        Steroidogenesis is rate-limited:          The enzymatic rate limiting step of steroid synthesis is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone.                  This occurs inside the mitochondria, by an enzyme called P450 Side Chain Cleavage (P450 SCC).                    The ACTUAL rate limiting step is the activity of StAR (which as we saw before was Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein).                  StAR mediates the import of cholesterol into the mitochondria.          Without cholesterol import, P450 SCC can’t convert anything into pregnenolone!                    However, for exam purposes, just remember that P450 SCC conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is the rate-limiting step.        Cholesterol is the precursor of all steroid hormones:          Most cholesterol is obtained from the blood, but it can also be synthesized from acetate within the Leydig cells.       P450 SCC mediated conversion of cholesterol is regulated by LH levels.      In response to increased LH, LH receptors on Leydig cells stimulate an increase in cAMP, which results in increased P450 SCC activity.        The first step in the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone is P450 SCC.  The last step in the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone is 17-β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase.  17-β-HSD converts androstenedione (which, as we recall, was an adrenal androgen) into testosterone.Testosterone Release &amp; Transportation  Testosterone is not stored in the testis. It rapidly diffuses into the blood, down its concentration gradient.  Since testosterone is a steroid hormone, it must be bound to a binding protein in order to be water soluble.          The most common binding proteins are (1) albumin, and (2) SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Protein).        Just like with cortisol, bound testosterone is biologically inactive; only the unbound hormone is active.  Protein binding of testosterone serves several useful functions:          Makes it water soluble.      Protects testosterone from breakdown.      Acts as a storage form for testosterone.      Gonadal Hormone Regulation in Males  In males, LH and FSH have different functions than in females.          Their names — Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone — are derived from their actions in the ovary, not the testis.        Both LH and FSH are glycoproteins with two subunits. Their alpha subunits are the same; their beta subunits determine their biological activity.  In the male, the mechanism of action of both is via cAMP:          LH acts on the Leydig cells to increase the activity of P450 SCC, which increases steroid synthesis in the testis.  Androgen Binding Protein (ABP) has the same amino-acid sequence as SHBG, but differs in its post-translational modification.      FSH acts on the Sertoli cells to stimulate a number of functions including synthesis of Androgen Binding Protein.        Sertoli cells produce inhibin in response to FSH.          Inhibin inhibits pituitary responsiveness to GnRH in FSH producing cells.      Hence, it acts as negative feedback for FSH production.        Both LH and FSH are controlled by GnRH, but their secretion is independent:          LH secretion is negatively regulated by testosterone.      FSH secretion is negatively regulated by inhibin.        Gonadal Hormone Regulation in Males      LH acts on the Leydig Cells to increase the activity of P450 Side Chain Cleavage.              This increases steroidogenesis, and ultimately, testosterone levels.        Testosterone then inhibits LH production.              FSH acts on the Sertoli Cells to stimulate a number of functions, including synthesis of ABP.              FSH also stimulates the production of Inhibin.        Inhibin then inhibits FSH production.                                         LH        FSH                            Acts on        Leydig Cells        Sertoli Cells                    Mechanism of Action        Increased intracellular cAMP        Increased intracellular cAMP                    Effects        Increased activity of P450 SCC        Many; includes synthesis of ABP                    Inhibited by        Testosterone        Inhibin            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/reproduction/2014/11/12/male-reproductive-physiology.html"},

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Perineum", "text": "  Perineum Anatomy Notes      See Perineum Anatomy Notes.    Objective      Define perineum and its boundaries.    Perineum → ‘The diamond shaped area between the legs’.          Lies inferior to the pelvic diaphragm, which we saw in Anatomy of the Pelvis.      The anterior tip of the diamond is the pubic symphysis.      The posterior tip of the diamond is the coccyx.      The lateral tips of the diamond are formed by the ischial tuberosities.      The edges of the diamond are formed by the inferior pubic rami anteriorly, and the sacrotuberous ligaments posteriorly.        The perineum is separated into 2 triangles:          Urogenital Triangle → anterior triangle that contains the urogenital structures.      Anal Triangle → posterior triangle that contains the anal structures.        The midpoint between the two triangles is the perineal body.          The perineal body is where a lot of the pelvic floor and perineal muscles attach.      You can see the attachments of these muscles below.        These two triangles are not coplanar → the urogenital plane is horizontal to the plane of the body, while the anal plane is oblique.Urogenital Triangle  Objective      Describe the compartments of the urogenital triangle.    The urogenital triangle is divided into 2 ‘pouches’.          These aren’t really the cavernous pouches that we’re accustomed to; they’re more like 2 separate regions.        These pouches are:          Deep Perineal Pouch → lies just inferior to the pelvic diaphragm.                  It contains the urogenital diaphragm, and its associated glands.                    Superficial Perineal Pouch → this lies superficially over the deep perineal pouch.                  It contains the genitalia, the nerves and vessels that feed it, and fascial linings (Colle’s Fascia).                    Superficial Perineal Pouch  Objective      Define the boundaries and structures of Superficial Perineal Pouch.  Lining of the Superficial Perineal Pouch  The superficial perineal pouch is lined with Colle’s fascia (aka. superficial perineal fascia).          Recall from GI that this was continuous with Scarpa’s fascia, coming down from the anterior abdominal wall.      This is outlined in blue below.        The superficial pouch also contains the genitalia, as described before.The superficial perineal pouch in a female. This is the region demarcated by Colle's fascia. Note that the deep perineal pouch is where the urogenital diaphragm is (deep to Colle's fascia).Here is the same diagram, except in a male.Muscles of the Superficial Perineal Pouch  Below, the skin and Colle’s fascia have been removed, so you can better see the structures contained in the superficial perineal pouch.  These are small muscles that cover the erectile tissue in both the male and the female:          Bulbospongiosus muscle → this covers the bulb of the penis in the male, and the bulb of vestibule in the female.                   Hence, it’s called the bulbo-spongiosus.          The -spongiosus arises from the fact that it’s made of spongy erectile tissue.                    Ischiocavernosus muscle → covers the right and left crus.                  In the male, this comes up and forms part of the penis.          In the female, this comes up and meets with the clitoris.          Ischio- since it comes off the ischium, and -cavernosus since it’s made of cavernous erectile tissue.                    Superficial Transverse Perineal Muscle                  Small muscles; these meet medially at the perineal body.                      These muscles help with sexual intercourse and voiding           They contract around the bulb and help contract the erectile tissues of the right and left crus.      Note that they’re not responsible for inducing erection → this is due to vascular engorgement.      Female Contents of the Superficial Perineal Pouch  In addition to the fascia and muscles described above, in the female, the vulva is located in the superficial perineal pouch as well.  The vulva is comprised of:          Labia Majora.      Labia Minora.      Clitoris.      Vestibule.        Surrounding the bulb of the vestibule is the bulbospongiosus muscle, as was described before.  After removing the muscle, you can see both the bulb of the vestibule, and the greater vestibular glands (aka. Bartholin’s glands), which lie further posterior.          The greater vestibular glands secrete into the vaginal opening.         Clinical Note      One application of this anatomy in the female is with an episiotomy.    An episiotomy is often done to widen the birth canal.          It involves making an incision, either midline or oblique, to the allow for the baby to exit more easily.      It was thought that this would prevent tearing, the idea being that a nice clean cut with a scalpel would heal better than a jagged tear.      However, research has shown that this isn’t the case, and the procedure is very controversial (some doctors will do it; others won’t).        What would you cut if you made a midline incision?          Going through the midline, you would cut the perineal body, which is not good since many muscles attach to it.      If you went too far, you’d be at risk of cutting the anal sphincter, which is also very bad.        What would you cut if you made an oblique incision?          Usually the (1) bulbospongiosus muscle and the (2) superficial transverse perineal muscle.      These usually heal better, so it’s typically better to do an oblique incision (or nothing at all).        Clinical Note      One application of this anatomy in the male is with an straddle injury.    A straddle injury is an injury to the crotch area that occurs when a person falls while straddling an object (like a bike seat).          This will cause damage to the spongy urethra, and possible tearing of the bulb of the penis.      This may result in leakage of blood or urine into the superficial perineal pouch.      Since this pouch is lined by Colle’s fascia, which is continuous with both Darto’s fascia (lines the scrotum and penis) and Scarpa’s fascia (lines the lower abdomen), this fluid can actually track up into scrotum and penis, as well as the abdominal area.        Remember      Colle’s Fascia → lines the superficial perineal pouch.    Darto’s Fascia → lines penis and scrotum.    Both of these are continuous with Scarpa’s fascia, meaning that a leak into the superficial perineal pouch can track into the abdomen.    Objective      Describe the course of the Pudendal Nerve.    The pudendal nerve provides somatic innervation to the superficial perineal pouch.          It arises from S2,3,4, and comes out of the sacral plexus.      It leaves the plexus thorugh a notch called the greater sciatic notch, and then immediately enters the perineum through the lesser sciatic notch.                  This pattern of ‘going out, and then back in’, is characteristic of the pudendal nerve.                    It runs in the pudendal canal, which follows the ischial tuberosity, and then it gives off branches:                  Inferior Rectal, which supplies the:                          Rectum.              External Anal Sphincter.                                Perineal Branches, which supply:                          Sensory innervation to the scrotal/labial area.              Muscles of the deep and superficial perineum (bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus, superficial transverse perineal, etc.).                                Dorsal Nerve, which supplies sensory innervation only to either the clitoris or the penis.                    It’s important to note that the inferior rectal branches and the perineal branches supply both motor and sensory innervation, while the dorsal nerve provides sensory innervation only.        Remember      The pudendal nerve provides somatic innervation to the perineum.    It (1) arises from S2,3,4, from the sacral plexus, (2) exits through the greater sciatic notch, and then (3) re-enters through the lesser sciatic notch into the perineum.    It then runs along the pudendal canal, before it gives off branches:              Inferior Rectal → motor and sensory to the rectum and external anal sphincter.        Perineal → motor and sensory to the scrotal/labial area, and muscles of the perineum.        Dorsal Nerve → sensory innervation only to the penis/clitoris.              Clinical Note      A pudendal nerve block is often done to anesthetize only the perineum.    A pudendal nerve block will affect the perineum, but not the rest of the vaginal canal, or the uterus.  There are 2 landmarks for performing a pudendal nerve block, depending on the route.            Ischial spine → this is a trans-vaginal approach.                  You palpate the ischial spine from within the vagina.          An example of this is shown to the right.                    Ischial tuberosity → this is a perineal approach.                  You palpate the iscial tuberosity externally, through the buttock.          This is used if you can’t do a trans-vaginal approach (for instance if a woman is giving birth).                      The pudendal nerve isn’t the only nerve that supplies the perineum → for complete anesthesia of the perineum, the ilioinguinal and the posterior cutaneous nerves must also be blocked.          However, usually a pudendal nerve block provides sufficient anesthesia.        Objective      Describe the course of the internal pudendal artery and vein.    The internal pudendal artery is the main blood supply to the perineum.          It comes off of the internal iliac artery.      It also has a corresponding vein → the internal pudendal vein.        The internal pudendal artery follows the course of the pudendal nerve.          In other words, exactly like we saw before, it:                  Goes out the greater sciatic notch.          Comes back in through the lesser sciatic notch.          Tracks along the pudendal canal.          Gives off rectal branches.          Gives off perineal branches.          Gives off a dorsal artery to the penis/clitoris.                    One difference here is that the internal pudendal also gives off a deep artery to the penis, along with the more superficial dorsal artery (in the male, of course).      Deep Perineal Pouch  Objective      Define Deep Perineal Pouch (Space) and its contents.    The deep perineal pouch is much smaller than the superficial perineal pouch. It comprises of the urogenital diaphragm.          Urogenital diaphragm → a partition (hence, diaphragm), that consists of 2 layers of membrane, with a muscle in between.      In other words, the urogenital diaphragm is a muscle sandwich.      In the female, the bladder sits of top of the UG diaphragm; in the male, it’s the prostate.        The components of this ‘muscle sandwich’ are:          Perineal membrane on the superficial side.      Voluntary muscle → the nature of this varies by gender.      Deep perineal fascia on the deep side.        The voluntary muscles of the UG diaphragm are innervated by the perineal branches of the pudendal nerve, and include:          Sphincter urethrae.                  The sphincter urethrae wraps around the urethra and prevents urination.          In females, it also loops around the vagina, and joins with the transverse perineal muscle. Hence, it also helps compress and support the vagina.                    Deep transverse perineal muscles.        Clinical Note      Deep pouch injuries are rarer than superficial pouch injuries, and have a different presentation.    Deep pouch injuries are rarer, and often involve trauma to the pelvis itself (such as a fracture).          Here, there is tearing of the urethra as it moves from deep to superficial, so fluid ends up accumulating at the urogenital diaphragm.      Since this is at the deep pouch, and not the superficial pouch, fluid will spill up into the pelvis, instead of into Colle’s fascia.        What this means is that fluid tracks different with deep pouch injuries than with superficial pouch injuries.          A superficial pouch injury (eg. a straddle injury) can track up the abdominal wall.      A deep pouch injury will track into the pelvis, and won’t enter the abdominal cavity (it’ll remain outside the parietal peritoneum).      Anal Triangle  Objective      Define the Anal triangle of the Perineum and its contents.    The anal triangle lies posterior to the urogenital triangle, and is much simpler.  As mentioned before, this is on an oblique angle to the plane of the body.  It is effectively comprised of the external anal sphincter, surrounded by a fat-filled ischioanal fossa.  The ischioanal fossa is a fat-filled cavity that comprises the majority of the anal triangle.          At the bottom of the fossa is the levator ani muscle, which is part of the pelvic floor.      Along the lateral wall is the obturator internus.        More specifically, the levator ani has the following borders:          Laterally → obturator internus.      Superiorly → pelvic floor (levator ani).       Medially → the anal canal.      Anteriorly → Colle’s fascia (the fascia of the superficial pouch).        The pudendal nerves and canal hug the lateral wall of the ischianal fossa as well.  Clinical Note      The main complication of the anal triangle is an ischioanal abcess.    An ischioanal abcess can arise from an anal fissure which spreads into the ischioanal fossa.          When dealing with one, you must be careful of the pudendal nerves and vessels, since they travel along the lateral borders.      Must also be careful not to disrupt integrity of anal sphincter, puborectalis, and perineal body.        Objective      Define the contents of the rectal and anal canal.    The rectal canal opens into the anal canal; it becomes the anal canal at the level of the levator ani (shown in green below).  Surrounding the anal canal are sphincters → an internal anal sphincter, and an external anal sphincter.          The external anal sphincter is part of the anal triangle, and is comprised of skeletal muscle. It is under somatic control.      The internal anal sphincter is a thickening of the actual GI tube, hence it is comprised of smooth muscle. It is under autonomic control.        The anal canal is divided in two by the pectinate line (also called the dentate line).          This is important clinically because it demarcates where the GI tract ends, and the epithelium begins.      Hence, the histology, blood supply, and innervation changes at this point.        The chart below illustrates some of these changes:  Features Above/Below the Pectinate Line                    Supply/Features        Above Pectinate Line        Below Pectinate Line                            Embryological origin        Endoderm        Ectoderm                    Arterial        Superior rectal artery        Middle/inferior rectal arteries.                    Venous Drainage        Superior rectal vein        Middle/inferior rectal veins.                    Lymphatic Drainage        Internal iliac lymph nodes        Superficial inguinal lymph nodes                    Innervation        Visceral        Somatic                    Histology        Simple columnar        Stratified squamous              Of particular note is the fact that anything above the pectinate line is viscerally innervated, and anything below the pectinate line is somatically innervated.          This makes sense → anything above the pectinate line is more like gut, and anything below it is more like skin.        Also, note that the superior rectal artery/vein supply the region superior to the pectinate line, and the middle/inferior rectal artery/vein supply the region inferior to the pecintate line.          This is important clinically because an internal hemorrhoid involves engorgement of the superior rectal veins, and an external hemorrhoid involves engorgement of the middle/inferior rectal veins.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Female Reproductive Tract", "text": "  Anatomy of the Female Reproductive Tract Notes      See Anatomy of the Female Reproductive Tract Notes.  Lecture Objectives  Locate the uterus, uterine tubes, ovaries and vagina and explain the anatomical basis for specific clinical conditions, eg ectopic pregnancy.  State the changes that occur in the position and size of the uterus during the life cycle and during pregnancy.  Given the structures that support and stabilize the uterus and vagina, propose possible complications if these structures are compromised.  discuss the “broad ligament” in terms of its components and the significance of structures found within the ligament folds.  On a diagram, outline the arterial supply, venous and lymphatic drainage and innervation of the reproductive organs.  Objective      Describe the structure, and location of the uterus, uterine tube, ovaries and vagina.    The uterus has 2 ligaments attached to it, which we saw were derived from the gubernaculum.          Round ligament of the uterus.      Ovarian ligament.        The uterine tubes are also referred to as the fallopian tubes, and they connect the uterus and the ovaries.          They don’t actually encapsulate the ovaries; rather, they have finger like projections called fimbriae that surround them.        The extension of the uterus into the vagina is called the cervix.  The uterus is sandwiched between the bladder anteriorly, and the rectum posteriorly.  Objective      Describe the position of the uterus with respect to cervix and vagina.    The position of the uterus varies between individuals.  To describe this, we characterize the uterus’ (1) flexion w.r.t. the vagina and (2) its flexion w.r.t. the cervix.          If the bladder is bent forward at the vagina towards the bladder, it is referred to as anteverted.      If the bladder is bent back at the vagina towards the rectum, it is referred to as retroverted.      If the bladder is bent forward at the cervix, it’s referred to as anteflexed.      If the bladder is bent backwards at the cervix, it’s referred to as retroflexed.        You can think of the ‘version’ as the tilt of the uterus, and the ‘flexion’ as the curving of the uterus.  The normal position of the uterus is anteverted, and anteflexed.  Why does this matter?          Digital exams, placement of IUDs, or pregnancies can be affected by the positioning of the uterus.        Remember      The most common position of the uterus is anteverted and anteflexed, so that it lies on top of the bladder.    Objective      Define the parts of the uterus, from a posterior view.    Below is a coronal view of the uterus, from its posterior aspect.  How can we tell that this is posterior, and not anterior?          The ovaries always project posteriorly, behind the broad ligament.        The uterus is categorized into 3 parts:          The upper part of the uterus is the fundus.      The middle part of the uterus is the body.      The lower part of the uterus is the cervix.        The wall of the uterus is also composed of 3 parts.          The lining is called endometrium.      The smooth muscle wall is called myometrium.      The outer part of the wall is called perimetrium, and it blends with the surrounding broad ligament.        The passageway between the uterus and the vagina has 2 mouths: an internal one, and an external one.          Hence, these are referred to as the internal os and the external os.      Between the two mouths lies the cervical canal.        Remember      The ovaries always project posteriorly with respect to the broad ligament.    Objective      State the changes that occur in the size and position of the uterus.    Prepuberty the ratio of uterine body:cervix is approximately 1:1.  After puberty, but before menopause, the body:cervix ratio becomes 2:1, to make more room for a potential child.  During pregnancy, the uterus gets extremely large → it pushes into the abdominal cavity, even as far as the xiphoid process! This can be seen to the right.  After menopause, the ratio returns to the prepubescent, 1:1 ratio.Here is what a uterus looks like in someone who is prepubertal or postmenopausal. Note that the cervix and body are approximately the same size.  Also, the external os changes in shape after a vaginal birth.          In women who have not had a vaginal birth before, their external os will be round.      In women who have had a vaginal birth, it will be more puckered and slit-like.        Changes in Uterine Size &amp; Features      Prepubescent women have a 1:1 body:cervix ratio.    Premenopausal women have a 2:1 body:cervix ratio.    Postmenopausal women have a 1:1 body:cervix ratio again.    A pregnant woman will (obviously) have a massive uterus.    Women who have had a vaginal birth will have a slit-like external os; women who have not will have a round external os.  On the left is the external os of a woman who has not had a vaginal birth; on the right is one who has had a vaginal birth. Note the rounded shape on the left, and the slit-like one on the right.  Objective      Describe the structures that support and stabilize the uterus &amp; vagina.    The uterus and vagina are supported by both muscle and ligaments.  Muscle:          This is the pelvic floor (aka. the pelvic diaphragm). It is the main dynamic support for the uterus.      Recall that this was comprised of:                  Levator ani.          Coccygeus muscles.                      Ligaments:          These arise from thickenings of the pelvic fascia.      These are mainly at the level of the vagina and cervix, in order to keep the uterus mobile. This helps during pregnancy.      There are 3 main ligaments:                  Uterosacral ligament (sacro-cervical), which projects posteriorly.		          Transverse cervical ligament (cardinal), which projects laterally.          Pubo-cervical ligament (anterior cervical), which projects anteriorly.                      Uterosacral Ligament          Also known as the sacro-cervical ligament.      This is shown in green below.      Note that it wraps around the uterus, and attaches to the sacrum; hence, ‘uterosacral’.      It functions as a sling for the uterus, and is an important landmark for the ureter.                  The ureter runs just lateral to the uterosacral ligament.                      Transverse Cervical Ligament          Also known as the cardinal ligament.      This is shown in red below.      This attaches to either side of the uterus, and extends laterally.      It functions to keep the uterus in a medial location, and is thought to give the most static support out of the 3 ligaments (hence, ‘cardinal’).        Pubocervical Ligament          Also known as the anterior cervical ligament.      This is smaller, and harder to see.      These ligaments attach anteriorly.        Remember      The main dynamic support for the uterus is the pelvic diaphragm (levator ani, coccygeus).    The main static support for the uterus are the transverse cervical ligaments (cardinal ligaments).    Weakening in either may result in a uterine prolapse or a cystocele.    When support from the pelvic diaphragm and ligaments is weakened:          You can have a uterine prolapse → the uterus could drop into the vaginal canal.      You can have a cystocele → the bladder could drop into the vaginal canal.        Objective      Describe parts and contents of the broad ligament.  Parts of the Broad Ligament  Broad ligament → a sheet of peritoneum that separates your reproductive organs from your intestinal structures.          Hence, it’s not a supportive structure, but rather a partition between repro and GI structures.        The broad ligament has 3 components:          Mesometrium → the part that’s attached to the uterus (hence -metrium).      Mesovarium → the part that’s attached to the ovary.  Note that -salpinx refers to a tube, typically the Fallopian or Eustacian tubes.      Mesosalpinx → the part that’s attached to the fallopian tube.        The meso- prefix suggests that these are mesenteries.          Recall that mesenteries were two joined layers of peritoneum.      This makes sense here → there’s peritoneum sandwiching both sides of the uterus, and where they stick together, you end up with mesentery.        The ovary isn’t encased in peritoneum:          Unlike the uterus, which is covered on both sides with peritoneum, the ovaries are stuck to the mesovarium.      Contents of the Broad Ligament  Since it’s a mesentery, many vessels travel within the broad ligament:          These include the uterine vessels and ureter.        The ligaments we discussed before (uterosacral, transverse cervical, pubocervical) are not part of the broad ligament.          As mentioned before, they’re thickenings of the pelvic fascia, and are hence inferior to the broad ligament.        The suspensory ligament is actually formed where the broad ligament draping over the ovarian artery and vein, as they approach the ovary.          Recall that the gonadal artery (ovarian/testicular) came off of the abdominal aorta (they were the boobs on the aorta man).      Hence, the suspensory ligament isn’t really a ligament, but rather a draping over the ovarian vessels.        Objective      Describe the location and structure of the Uterine Tubes and Ovaries.    The fallopian tube has the following parts:          Uterine → the part that merges with the uterus.      Isthmus → the long part.      Ampulla → where the tube begins to widen.      Infundibulum → the funnel shaped end of the ampulla.      Fimbriae → the finger like projections of the fallopian tube that surround the ovary.        Clinical Note      Hysterosalpingography can be done to make sure that the fallopian tubes are patent.    Hysterosalpingography → imaging of the uterus (hystero-) and fallopian tubes (salpingo-).  This involves injecting contrast through the vaginal canal, into the uterus.  Normally, the contrast should flow from the uterus through the fallopian tubes, and spill into the abdominal cavity.          Since the fimbriae and ovary are outside of the broad ligament, and are not directly connected to one another, there’s a gap between the two that communicates with the intraperitoneal space.      When the egg is released from the ovary, it travels across the small distance between the two, directed only by fluid flows created by the fimbriae.        If contrast does not flow all the way out, then there’s an obstruction.  Objective      Describe the location and structure of the Vagina (medial sagittal view).    The vagina is a thin-walled muscular tube sandwiched between the bladder and the rectum.  It passes through the urogenital diaphragm, which, as we’ll see tomorrow with Anatomy of the Perineum, is part of the deep perineal pouch.          The muscles in the urogenital diaphragm, namely the sphincter urethrae, help support and compress the vagina.        The upper end of the vagina envelops the bottom part of the uterus (the cervix).          Because the walls of the vagina then attach to the sides of the uterus, it creates these spaces on either side of the external os.      These are known as fornices, of which the posterior fornix is the largest space.        The posterior fornix is very thin walled.          This is important because the only thing separating the fornix from the abdominal cavity here is the vaginal wall and a thin layer of peritoneum.      Furthermore, the pouch that lies outside of the posterior fornix is the rectouterine pouch (more commonly known as the cul de sac, or the Pouch of Douglas).        Clinical Note      A culdocentesis can be done through the posterior fornix in order to remove material from the cul de sac.    Since the posterior fornix is so thin, it’s a convenient location to puncture in order to access the cul de sac.  It’s often used when there’s purulent fluid in the cul de sac.  This procedure is called a culdocentesis.  As we’ve mentioned before, we have a vesicouterine pouch formed by the space between the bladder and uterus, and a rectouterine pouch formed by the space between the uterus and rectum.  As mentioned above, the rectouterine pouch is often also called the Pouch of Douglas, or the cul de sac.  However, we also have another pouch defined by the space lateral to the uterus → this is the adnexal pouch.Recall that the suspensory ligament isn’t really a ‘ligament, but rather a draping over the ovarian vessels.  This space is important clinically since the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and suspensory ligaments lie there.  Clinical Note      Endometriosus is where endometrial tissue from the inner lining of the uterus implants itself outside of the uterus.    The most common place for this ectopic endometrial tissue to implant itself is in the Pouch of Douglas, along the uterosacral ligaments.  Since this tissue is endometrial, it’ll respond to the hormonal cycle → for instance, it’ll grow with estrogen.  It would also logically present in women that are still in their reproductive years.  These patients will often present with a dull crampy pain, and nausea, that won’t respond to painkillers.  When working a patient up for endometriosus, you have to r/o GI problems by asking for changes in bowel habits.  Objective      Follow the path of uterine, vaginal and ovarian artery.    As mentioned before, the ovarian arteries come off the aorta, get covered by the broad ligament to form the suspensory ligament, and then feed the ovary.  The ovarian artery will then anastamose with the uterine artery, which comes up from the internal iliac to supply the uterus and vagina.          Recall that the uterine artery travels within the broad ligament.      The vaginal artery can either be a branch off the uterine artery, or directly off the internal iliac.        Hence, there’s a dual supply of blood here.  As we saw in Genitourinary, both the ovarian and uterine arteries cross over the ureter:          Hence we referred to them as a ‘bridge over troubled water’ (the troubled water being the urine-containing ureter).      As we saw, this was a helpful feature for landmarking the ureter.        Remember      The ovarian artery comes down from the aorta.    The uterine artery comes up from the internal iliac.    The vaginal artery either (1) branches off of the uterine artery, or (2) comes directly off of the internal iliac.    Both the ovarian artery and the uterine artery cross over the ureter.    Objective      Name the venous drainage of the female reproductive organs.    Venous drainage is via plexuses.  The venous plexus around the bladder is the vesical plexus.  The venous plexuses around the uterus and vagina are called the uterine plexus and vaginal plexus respectively.  All of these plexuses will drain via either the internal iliac vein or the ovarian vein.          This is just like what we saw with the arterial supply → the arterial supply comes off of the aorta (via the ovarian artery) or the internal iliac (via the uterine/vaginal arteries).        Objective      Describe the innervation of the female reproductive organs.    Autonomic Innervation:          Sympathetic:                  This is via the inferior hypogastric plexus.          The nerves originate at L1-L2.          Provides vasomotor innervation to the uterine gland.                    Parasympathetic:                   This is via the pelvic splanchnics.          The nerves originate at S2,3,4.          Provides motor innervation to the vaginal smooth muscle.                      Somatic Innervation:          This is via the pudendal nerve, which provides somatic innervation to the lower vagina and perineum.        Summary of Innervation of the Female Reproductive System  Autonomic Innervation      Autonomic innervation (sympathetic or parasympathetic) is described below:                               Sympathetic        Parasympathetic                            Comes off of        Inferior Hypogastric Plexus        Pelvic Splanchnics                    Origin        L1-L2        S2,3,4                    Function        Vasomotor to uterine gland        Motor to smooth muscle of the vagina.              Somatic Innervation      The pudendal nerve provides somatic innervation to the lower vagina and perineum.    Pain fibres follow the Sympathetic/Parasympathetic Innervation:          Uterine pain goes back with the sympathetic nerves.      Vaginal/cervical pain goes back with the parasympathetic nerves.        This makes a lot of sense → the sympathetic nerves supply the uterus, so it makes sense that uterine pain travels with the sympathetics. Similarly, the parasympathetic nerves supply the vagina, so it makes sense that vaginal pain travels with the parasympathetics.  Example Application      Hyposthesia would be found in which of the following after a sacral nerve block?              Vaginal canal and perineum.        Uterine contractions.        Lower back.              Here, the answer is the vaginal canal and perineum:          This is because the vaginal canal and perineum are supplied by the parasympathetic nerves, which originate from S2,3,4.      Since the pain fibres follow the parasympathetics here, they’ll also go back to S2,3,4, where they’d be blocked by a sacral nerve block.        What if you wanted to block pain from uterine contractions?          Here, the uterine pain fibres follow the sympathetics, which originate in L1-L2.      Hence you’d need a lumbar block.        Note that the pudendal nerve branches off of the sacral plexus.          Hence, if you do a sacral block at the level of the sacral plexus, you end up blockage of the regions fed by both the somatic nerves (since this is from the pudendal), and the parasympathetic nerves.        In other words, we can have 3 different types of nerve blocks:          A pudendal block will block sensation to the somatic structures (the perineum, and upper vagina).      A sacral block will block sensation to both the somatic structures and the ones fed by parasympathetic nerves (ie. the subperitoneal contents).      A lumbar block will block sensation to the uterus (ie. the ‘intraperitoneal’ contents.)        Why is the uterus referred to as intraperitoneal when it’s outside of the peritoneum?          Technically the uterus is retroperitoneal, since it lies outside of the peritoneum lining the abdominal cavity.      However, since it projects into the abdominal cavity, OBGYNs refer to the uterus as intraperitoneal → this is a little confusing!        Nerve Blocks for the Female Reproductive System      A pudendal block will block sensation to the somatic structures.    A sacral block will block both sensation to the somatic structures (via the pudendal) and the subperitoneal structures.    A lumbar block will block sensation to the uterus (referred to as ‘intraperitoneal’).    The lymphatics follow the blood supply:          The ovaries and fallopian tubes get their blood supply from the ovarian artery, which comes off of the aorta. Hence, their lymphatic drainage is from the para-aortic nodes.      The uterus and vagina get their blood supply from the uterine and vaginal arteries, which come off of the internal iliac. Hence, their lymphatic drainage is from the internal iliac nodes (and the sacral nodes).

	{"title": "Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract", "text": "  Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract Notes      See Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract Notes.  Lecture Objectives  State the origin of the cells that contribute to the formation of the genital ridges.  Describe the formation of gonads, ducts and external genitalia from indifferent stages to definitive structures.  Describe the non-descent of ovaries and the anatomical basis for abnormal development of the female reproductive organs.The Urogenital Ridge  We’ll be looking at the urogenital ridge, which we saw previously with Embryology of the Kidney.  Associated with the urogenital ridge are 2 ducts:          Mesonephric Duct, aka. the Wolffian Duct.                  This develops into the male internal genitalia.          It also forms some of the glomeruli of the second kidney, the mesonephros.                    Paramesonephric Duct, aka. the Mullerian Duct.                  This develops into the female internal genitalia.                      Remember      The mesonephric duct is also known as the Wolffian Duct, and develops into the male internal genitalia.    The paramesonephric duct is also known as the Mullerian Duct, and develops into the female internal genitalia.    As seen before, the urogenital ridge is comprised of a medial ridge and a lateral ridge.          The medial ridge is the gonadal ridge → it forms the testes/ovaries.      The lateral ridge is the mesonephric ridge → the Wolffian and Mullerian ducts lie here, which become the rest of the male/female internal genitalia.        In other words, the gonadal ridge eventually forms the testis/ovary, and the mesonephric ridge will form everything else (the ducts and related organs).  Primitive sex cells migrate from the yolk sac via the dorsal mesentery, and form primitive sex cords at the gonadal ridge.          In the male, these become the seminiferous tubules.      In the female, these become the follicles.      Sexual Diferentiation  As we’ve seen before, differentiation into a male requires the presence of the SRY gene, which ultimately stimulates Sertoli cells to produce MIS, which inhibits Mullerian Duct development.          This means that the female reproductive structures develop passively → without any external stimulation, the Wolffian (mesonephric) duct will naturally regress, and the Mullerian (paramesonephric) duct will develop.        For a review of this, read Sex Determination &amp; Differentiation.Descent of the Ovaries  We saw before that there is a gubernaculum that attaches to the gonads (ovary/testes).  In the male, this drags the testes down into the scrotal sac.  Then why don’t the ovaries end up descending all the way in a female?          In the female, the uterus gets in the way.      As the gubernaculum is pulling the ovaries down, the uterus is also developing from the paramesonephric duct.       The uterus ends up getting in the way of the gubernaculum, and the gubernaculum ends up ‘sticking’ to it.      As a result, you end up with two vestigial ligaments:                  The ovarian ligament, which is the part of the gubernaculum that was from the ovary to the uterus.          The round ligament, which is the part of the gubernaculum that was from the uterus down to the labioscrotal region.                      Development of the Uterus:          The uterus arises from the merging of the left and right paramesonephric ducts.      The remaining unattached parts form the uterine tubes (the fallopian tubes).        Development of the Vagina:            The vagina is actually comprised of two embryological derivatives; the lower part of the paramesonephric ducts coming down, and a part of the urogenital sinus coming up.      At the bottom, where the vagina meets the vestibule, a perforated membrane forms, called the hymen.      Congenital Abnormalities of the Uterus  As mentioned before, the uterus is created by the merging of the paramesonephric ducts.  Congenital abnormalities of the uterus can then be viewed as a problem with this merging process.          If the two duct lumens fail to merge completely, you end up with a double uterus, or vagina.      If the lumens only merge at the bottom, you end up with a bicornuate uterus.      If the two ducts merge completely, but the lumens fail to merge, you end up with a septate uterus.      If one of the paramesonephric ducts fails to develop fully/at all, you can end up with a rudimentary horn or a unicornuate uterus, respectively.        This can be better seen below:Variations in the Hymen  Normally, the hymen doesn’t cover the entirety of the vaginal opening.  If it does, you end up with an imperforate hymen, which may cause amenorrhea (nothing can get out).  You can also have a very small opening (a microperforate hymen), or two openings (a septate hymen).Female Genital Development  As we saw in Genitourinary, both the male and female genitals arise from a common undifferentiated structure.  From this point, in the female:          The glans becomes the clitoris.      The labioscrotal swelling becomes the labia majora.      The urethral folds become the labia minora.      The urethral groove remains open, and becomes the vestibule.        In the male, the urethral groove zips up. As we saw in the past, anomalies in this can result in hypospadias.  Summary of Female Reproductive Tract Embryology      The primitive sex cords form the follicles in a female, and seminiferous tubules in a male.    In a female, the gubernaculum gets affixed to the uterus, forming the (1) ovarian ligament and the (2) round ligament of the uterus.    The paramesonephric ducts form the (1) fallopian tubes, (2) uterus, and (3) upper vagina.    The urogenital sinus forms the (1) urethra and (2) lower vagina.    The vagina is formed by the merging of the bottom of the paramesonephric ducts, and the top of the urogenital sinus.
