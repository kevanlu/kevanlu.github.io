Lecture Objectives  At the end of this session you will be able to:           List the prerequisites for normal menstruation in an adolescent.       Define primary and secondary amenorrhea.       In an adolescent with amenorrhea outline an approach to investigations based on:                   Primary or secondary amenorrhea           Delayed or normal pubertal development           Presence or absence of hyperandrogenism                     Based on the clinical history of amenorrhea in an adolescent, list the most likely etiology.       Use growth parameters plotted on a growth chart to assist with diagnosis in adolescent amenorrhea.       State the indications for a progesterone challenge in an adolescent.      In a clinical history, identify the risk factors for adolescent pregnancy.      Introduction  What are the prerequisites for normal menstruation?  What are the endocrine events at puberty that normally lead to menstruation?  How do adrenocortical hormones affect this cycle?  How does stress affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and the menstrual cycle?Case #1  Case Summary  Beth is a 14 year old girl who comes to your family practice office because she has not yet started to menstruate. The other girls in her class tease her. Beth has generally been well and has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations. She has a good energy level and appetite. She is a B+ student and active in sports. Beth has not seen a physician in 4 years.  You meet with Beth on her own. She looks well but appears younger than her chronologic age. She seems anxious and says that she would like to be a “little taller,” but she is mostly worried about why she has not had any breast development. “All my friends are developed, and I get teased in gym class when I undress. My mom said she got her period when she was 12.”  What is the medical term for Beth’s problem? How is it defined in an adolescent?          Delayed puberty.      Defined as a lack of puberty past the age of 13 in females; 14 in males.      Amenorrhea.      Primary amenorrhea = no 2o sex characteristics past the age of 13.      Only considered secondary if past 16.      Secondary amenorrhea if 2o sex characteristics, but no menarche. Or no secondary sex characteristics past the age of 16!?      Mother got period when 12.        Why is it important to meet with Beth on her own (without a parent)?          Always important in an adolescent, to get honest answers.      Especially important with delayed puberty, because abuse and neglect may cause it.      Make sure you ask the HEADSS questions:                  Home &amp; Environment.          Education &amp; Employment.          Activities.          Drugs.          Sexuality.          Suicide/Depression.                      What additional information would you like to know about Beth?          Bone age?      Pelvic U/S to see if she has a uterus. (Abdo + pelvis).      Older siblings?      Have you had any hospital admissions?      Parent heights.      HEADSS, stressors, appetite.      Dysmorphic features (r/o Turners).        What is the normal sequence of puberty (breast development, pubic hair, and growth) in a female patient?            Thelarche comes first.      Adrenarche/Growth Spurt comes after.      Menarche comes last.        Additional Information  Beth’s past medical history is remarkable for recurrent otitis media as a child for which myringotomy tubes were placed at age 3 years. She was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy. Birth weight was 3.5 kg and her length was 50 cm. She met normal developmental milestones. She is taking no medications or vitamins.  Her mother’s height is 157 cm and the father’s height 175 cm. On physical exam, she is young-appearing and healthy.  Upon clinical exam:      VS: BP 100/64, Pulse 76.    Weight is 35 kg.    Height 137 cm.    Tanner I (breast and pubic hair).	    What is Beth’s expected adult height based on parental height?          (157 + 175 - 13)/2 = 159.5 cm.        Plot Beth’s growth parameters. What do you conclude?          3rd percentile for weight.      Well below the 3rd percentile for height.        Should you perform a pelvic examination?          No. It shouldn’t be done before the first menses, or even the first sexual experience.      It’s unlikely that a vaginal/uterine abnormality will be a primary cause of delayed puberty, so here’s it’s not really indicated.        What is the differential diagnosis for Beth’s scenario?          Turner’s Syndrome.      Prolactinoma or other pituitary/hypothalamic problems.      Any eugonadotropic eugonadism causes can probably be ruled out since there seem to be developmental delays.      Most common: pregnancy, constitutional delay, turner’s.      APPROACH TO PRIMARY AMENORRHEA WITHOUT SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS- Look for presence/absence of uterus.- If absent -&gt; karyotype.- If present, look at FSH and LH to see if central or not.  Why must pregnancy be considered in girls with primary amenorrhea?          She could have had sex before her first menses.      Recall that ovulation happens before menstruation.        What is the most likely diagnosis? Why?          Turner’s      Stress, eating disorders, excessive exercise, causing ovarian failure.        What tests would you want to order and why?          Pelvic/abdo U/S.      TSH, Prolactin, FSH, LH.      Bone age.      ESR for chronic conditions.      Karyotype.      CBC -&gt; anemia.      Lytes (electrolyte abnormalities seen with pts with eating disorders).        What is the diagnosis?  What are the characteristics of this disorder? Why might Beth not have all the characteristic features?          She’s a mosaic, so some cells will be normal, others won’t be.        What treatment would you recommend for Beth?          GH for height.      Estrogen.      Case #2  Secondary amenorrhea, since has had periods before.Case #3", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/reproduction/2014/11/20/chsg-adolescent-amenorrhea.html"},

	{"title": "TBL Small Group Notes", "text": "  NuvaRing + Condoms.  People with NuvaRing have to change stuff less often.      IUD insertion is uncomfortable → usually used as a last resort in nulliparous, young women.    Proterone Acetone D is best, because it’s an anti-estrogen, and the patient has PCOS.Case #1  Case Summary  Alice, a 25 year old nulliparous woman, had unproteted sex 72 hours ago. She is healthy and normotensive. Her menstrual cycle is 34 days long.  Alice’s changes of becoming pregnant are increased if intercourse occurred:          On day 14 of the menstrual cycle.      When her basal body temp has increased.      When her cervical mucous changes to opaque.      Before mid cycle onset of Mittelschmerz.      When her oocyte was arrested in prophase of meiosis I.                  Explanation:          Explanation. Progesterone release causes increased temp. Progesterone from corpus luteum, hence ovulated already.          BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN WE SAID THAT 2 IS A RETROACTIVE MARKER OF OVULATION?          When we mentioned it in class, referred to those people that had issues with fertility.          Want to maximize window, so you actually have to start JUST PRIOR to ovulation so you don’t miss it.          Timed intercourse every other day to (1) maximize sperm count, and (2) minimize fatigue (that shit gets tiring).                      Ovulation occurs on day 14 only with a 28 day cycle.If she doesn’t want to get pregnant, what would you recommend for Alice?	1. Yuzpe Method.	2. Plan B.	3. Mirena.	4. Nova T.	5. Pregnancy test, then D&amp;C (Dilation and curettage) if positive.Recall, Plan B only works up to 72 hours.If you have ANY doubt, go for Nova T. Nova T works up to a week.Preg test wouldn’t be positive after 72 hours. If positive, would have been from a previous sexual encounter.Generally, do a β-HCG before implantation of Nova T, since contraindicated in pregnant.NOTE: Dr. Albert Yuzpe was the person who first developed the Yuzpe method.Case #2  Case Summary  Shirley, a 35 year old woman, comes into the clinic. She just had her second child last week, and does not wish to have any more children. Her husband has already arranged to have a vasectomy but she would like to discuss contraception while they are waiting for this to be done. She is currently breastfeeding but she is on domperidone to increase her breast milk production.  What method of contraception would you recommend?          Vasectomy is effective immediately and additional contraception is unneccessary.      Combined low dose OCPs.      Breast feeding is protective, and additional contraception is unncessary.      Progesterone only pill.      Diaphragm.        Estrogen inhibits lactation. If you interrupt breast milk supply, you may not ever be able to breast-feed again.  POP is effective because breast feeding itself inhibits ovulation (check if it’s OVULATION. PRL).  Diaphragm shouldn’t be used. Only a week post-partum so the uterus is not at its normal size, and fitting would be abnormal.          They’re not very common anymore, and would be pretty ineffective except for the added spermicide.        Additional Information  Shirley’s 36 year old sister Maria, had her 2nd child 2 years ago and has decided her family is complete. She is currently on the combined OCP for her menorrhagia. She is now requesting permanent sterilization.  Your recommendation is to:          Discontinue the OCP and undergo a tubal ligation.      Continue the OCP and undergo a tubal ligation.      Discontinue the OCP and consider Mirena.      Discontinue the OCP and consider the Nova T.      Continue the OCP and ask her to bring her husband in to discuss a vasectomy.      Vasectomies are less invasive, better efficacy. Discussing things wouldn’t hurt, and you can still do the other options.You gotta figure out who wants the permanent contraception.Why isn’t this the best answer?	- She still has heavy flow, so Mirena would help with that.	- And if she ever changes her mind, she can just take it out.- MIRENA IS AS EFFECTIVE AS A TUBAL LIGATION.- Not covered under OHIP to have re-anastamosis if you change your mind with tubal ligation.- And hospital stay not covered.Csae #3  Case Summary  Barbara, a 24 year old woman, presents to her family doctor asking for birth control. You check her chart and discover that she had been treated for a pulmonary embolism 2 years ago. She has a regular menstrual cycle and was previously treated for Chlamydia. You also notice that she is a sex trade worker and has a limited income.  The best form of contraception for her would be:          Mirena.      Depo-provera.      Progestin Only Pill.      Combined OCPs.      NuvaRing.      Can’t used combined OCPs or NuvaRing because of PE, contraindicated. Both have estrogen.Mirena is expensive, around $500.Less than 5 years of OCP, but more than Depo-provera.Case #4  Case Summary  Violet, a 15 year old girl, presents to the birth control clinic. She has been sexually active for 4 months now and uses condoms occasionally. She is inquiring about hormonal birth control but is worried about weight gain, as she currently weighs 198lbs. She also worries about forgetting to take the pills. She specifically asks you not to tell her mom, who is also a patient of yours.  What contraceptive recommendations would you make to Violet?          NuvaRing.      Depo-Provera.      EVRA.      Recommend she uses condoms every time.      Talk to her parents first.      EVRA is less effective in patients with a high BMI.Patients don’t like using NuvaRing because of the mechanics of taking it in and out. Take it out for intercourse, and may forget to put it back in.Depo-Provera can cause weight gain (BAD), and must have an appointment every 3 months. Might be hard to hide from parents.Violet informs you that she wants to take the ‘pill’ since that what’ her friends are taking. After ensuring that she understands the risks and benefits, you prescribe her the combination oral contraceptive pill. She comes back to the clinic 4 motnhs later with complaints of headaches immediately before and during her hormone-free period. She has had limited success with over-the-counter analgesics.  The best management option for her is:          NuvaRing.Prescribed analgesics.Continuous combined oral contraceptives.EVRALower dose estrogen oral contraceptive.      May still want to fit in with friends, so best to stay on the pill.Mechanism behind the headaches?- Caused by hormone withdrawal of estrogen.CONTINUOUS COMBINED CONTRACEPTIVES?Hormonal withdrawal symptomsAlso endometriosis?!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/reproduction/2014/11/17/TBL-small-group-notes.html"},

Introduction  Unlike the testis, which aims to produce a ton of spermatozoa, the ovary aims for quality, and not quantity.          Over a lifetime, a woman may only ovulate a few hundred times, so those oocytes must be good.        Hence, the ovary places a huge selection pressure on the ovarian follicle, to ensure that only those oocytes with a high developmental competence are released.  Aside      “The oocyte that you are derived from developed in your mother’s ovary while she was developing in your grandmother’s uterus”.              Since your environment has a profound influence on gamete development, your grandmother can actually directly influence the ‘health’ of your oocyte!            Anatomy &amp; Oogenesis  The ovary consists of stroma tissue, germ cells, and accessory cells.  Most of the stromal tissue is connective tissue and fibroblasts, but it also contains circular ‘container’ structures known as follicles.          Each ovum lies within a follicle.      Meiosis in these ova is arrested is arrested at Meiosis I → it only resumes when ovulation occurs.      It’s the mid-cycle LH surge that triggers ovulation, and the resumption of meiosis.        Only a small part of the mature follicle is actually released during ovulation; the rest persists in the ovary and becomes the corpus luteum.          The part of the follicle that is released along with the ovum is comprised of cumulus cells, which are specialized granulosa cells.      The remaining corpus luteum produces very high levels of progesterone, which prepares the uterus for implantation.        The corpus luteum only persists for 2 weeks if the oocyte isn’t fertilized.  This is why β-HCG testing is used for pregnancy. The test involves using an antibody specific to the β subunit of the hCG protein.          If the oocyte is fertilized, it will release a specific hormone that ‘tells’ the corpus luteum to persist → this hormone is hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin).      If the oocyte is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will regress into what’s known as the corpus albicans.        The ovary is only loosely tethered to the fallopian tubes by fimbrae.          During ovulation, the oocyte is actually chucked out into free space, directed only by fluid flows created by the fimbrae.      Folliculogenesis  The primordial follicle is sleeping; there’s little biological activity.  Via some as-of-yet-unknown stimulation, this primordial follicle is activated to become a primary follicle.          A primary follicle is defined as an oocyte that is surrounded by one layer of granulosa cells.        When more than one layer of granulosa cells form around the oocyte, then the follicle is referred to as a secondary follicle.          Follicle maturation can progress to this stage without the influence of the hypothalamus or pituitary, and hence do not require gonadotropin action.      However, all subsequent steps require the action of FSH.        With the action of FSH, the follicle further develops such that (1) a cell layer forms outside the granulosa, and (2) a fluid-filled cavity forms within the granulosa. It is then known as a tertiary follicle.          The outside cell layer is known as the theca.                  The theca cells of this new theca layer are the female equivalent of the leydig cells → they produce androgens in response to LH stimulation.                    The inner fluid-filled cavity is known as the antrum.                  Formation of the antrum requires FSH stimulation of the granulosa cells.          The granulosa cells are the female equivalent of sertoli cells → they form an antrum in response to FSH stimulation.                      The final stage of follicular development is known as the Graafian follicle (aka. pre-ovulatory follicle, mature follicle). This can be very large, up to 2 cm in size.  Throughout folliculogenesis, the oocyte remains arrested at diplotene of Meiosis I.          In other words, while the oocyte is in the follicle, Meiosis is inhibited.      Meiosis only resumes with ovulation, in response to an LH surge.        Remember      Theca cells are the female equivalent of leydig cells → they produce androgens in response to LH stimulation.    Granulosa cells are the female equivalent of sertoli cells → they form an antrum in response to FSH stimulation.  Oocyte Maturation  Meiosis is arrested at diplotene (a part of Prophase I) in Meiosis I, while the oocyte is in the follicle.          This applies to all of the oocytes that a woman has.        Upon ovulation, Meiosis I is completed asymmetrically, resulting in the formation of a 2n oocyte and a polar body. Meiosis is then arrested again at Metaphase II  Meiosis is only completed upon fertilization of the oocyte by a spermatozoa, resulting in the ejection of another polar body, and a 1n chromosomal complement.          Technically speaking, the oocyte is never really fully haploid, because ejection of the polar body occurs after fertizilation, when the spermatozoa’s DNA is there too.         Summary Oocyte Maturation Arrest      There are 2 points where oocyte maturation is arrested, at diplotene of Prophase I, and at Metaphase II.                               Prophase I (Diplotene)        Metaphase II                            When?        While the oocyte is still in the follicle.        After ovulation, but before fertilization.                    What triggers resumption of Meiosis?        Ovulation (LH)        Fertilization                    Chromosomal Complement        4n        2n              Oocyte numbers peak during fetal development and then fall until they’re completely gone.  Menopause occurs when oocyte numbers are depleted.  Most follicles that begin to develop neither progress to become a Graafian follicle, nor become ovulated.          These follicles, which fail to survive against strong negative selection pressures, then become atretic follicles.      Ovarian follicle atresia describes the degeneration, apoptosis, and eventual reabsorption of failed follicles.        This process repeats every month → a cohort of secondary follicles is selected, and over the course of time, one follicle becomes dominant, and the rest undergo atresia.Chemistry and Secretion of Steroid Hormones  This is almost exactly the same as what we saw last lecture with Male Reproductive Physiology, but with one key difference.          Instead of stopping at Testosterone (which, as we recall, was converted from Androstenedione by 17-β-HSD), we have an additional conversion to estradiol.      This is mediated by Aromatase, which catalyzes the conversion of:                  Testosterone to Estradiol.          Estrone to Estradiol.                    In other words, Aromatose converts androgens to estrogens.        How is ovarian steroidogenesis regulated?          This is conceptually very similar to what we saw in the testis.      The theca cell (the female analog of the leydig cell) produces androgens in response to LH. The androgen that is produced is mainly androstenedione, and it’s used for aromatization.      Aromatization itself occurs in the granulosa cells (the female analog of the Sertoli Cell), in respone to FSH.                  Aromatase immediately converts estrone into estradiol.          FSH stimulation is indirect; rather than increasing the aromatase activity per cell, FSH actually increases the number of cells by causing granulosa cell proliferation.                    Just like in the testis, both of these actions are mediated by cAMP.        The corpus luteum also produces estradiol, under the influence of LH.Release, Transportation, and Inactivation  This is also very similar to what we saw with Male Reproductive Physiology.  Plasma binding proteins differ for estradiol and progesterone.          For estradiol, (1) albumin and (2) SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) are the primary binding proteins, just like with testosterone.      For progesterone, (1) albumin and (2) CBG (Cortisol Binding Globulin) are the primary binding proteins.        Unlike testosterone, neither estradiol nor progesterone require conversion to a more active form (eg. DHT).  Estradiol is required to induce progesterone receptors:Endocrine Regulation of the Ovarian Cycle  In males and females, hypothalamic GnRH triggers the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary.  The targets of LH and FSH differ between males and females, as discussed before:          In males LH targets Leydig cells; in females LH targets Theca cells.      In males FSH targets Sertoli cells; in females FSH targets Granulosa cells.        Negative feedback in females is much more complicated:          In males, we saw that LH was inhibited by testosterone, and FSH was inhibited by inhibin.      In females, FSH regulation isn’t as simple → unlike in the male, where FSH is not very useful, and can be kept at low levels, FSH is critical in the female.                  Hence, FSH regulation becomes a much more complex process, where inhibin plays a less clear role.                    Hormone Regulation During the Ovarian Cycle  The length of the ovarian cycle can vary wildly, both between different women, and within the same woman.          This difference is at the follicular phase, which means that it’s often difficult to predict when you’ll ovulate.        Progesterone rises during the luteal phase:          Progesterone is made in the follicular phase as well, but it’s quickly converted to estradiol because the follicle is still growing and its granulosa cells are causing aromatization.      Once ovulation occurs, the follicle is converted to the corpus luteum.                  Now, since aromatization decreases, not all of the progesterone that’s produced by the corpus luteum can be converted.          Hence, the corpus luteum will release progesterone.                      FSH is high at the beginning of the cycle, and then falls during the follicular phase:          This is because FSH is necessary for the progression of folliculogenesis.      However, as the follicle becomes larger, FSH actually declines. This is due to negative feedback by estradiol.                  Follicle growth → granulosa cell proliferation → increased aromatase activity → increased conversion to estradiol.          Hence, estradiol inhibits FSH secretion.                      FSH suddenly peaks at the end of the follicular phase:            Prolonged high levels of estradiol shift the negative feedback to a feed-forward response.                  This can be seen in the figure to the right, which was from an old experiment done on Rhesus monkeys.          Immediately upon estradiol injection, gonadotropin levels fall due to negative feedback.          But around 48h after injection, there is actually a surge in gonadotropin levels → this is the transition to the feed-forward response.                    Feed-Forward Response = positive feedback but with a time delay.      This leads to a huge surge of FSH and LH.                  LH release triggers ovulation, and allows for the oocyte to be un-arrested from diplotene.                      FSH Regulation in the Ovarian Cycle      FSH is high at the beginning of the cycle, in order to stimulate folliculogenesis past the secondary follicle.    FSH falls as the follicle grows, due to increased negative feedback by estradiol (which is produced due to increased aromatase activity).    FSH suddenly peaks at the end of the follicular phase, due to prolonged estradiol suppression leading to a transition to a feed-forward response.    Just prior to ovulation, the Granulosa cells will also express LH receptors          This is because the entire follicle (both the outer thecal layer, and the inner granulosa layer) needs to respond to LH in order for ovulation to occur.      This is shown in the image below → the bottom left cell reflects a granulosa cell just prior to ovulation.      Physiologic Effects of the Ovarian Steroids  Effects of Estradiol:          On non-sexual tissues:                  Estradiol accelerates linear bone growth and closure of the epiphysial plates.          In adults it supports osteoblast/osteocyte activity and prevents bone resorption (recall that this is because estradiol binds RANK-L).          Hepatic protein synthesis (especially SHBG, CBG, TBG) is stimulated by estrogen.                    On secondary sex characteristics:                  Estrogen stimulates fat deposition and growth of the duct systems of the breast.                    On secondary sex organs:                  There are effects on the Fallopian tubes, the uterus, cervix and vagina.          Estradiol is important in building up the endometrium.                      Effects of Progesterone:          On non-sexual tissues:                  Affects body temperature → this is why natural family planning based on basal body temperature works to a certain extent.                    On secondary sex characteristics:                  Progesterone promotes the development of the lobules and alveoli of the mammary glands.                    On the reproductive tract:                  Progesterone is important in maintaining/shedding the endometrium.                    Summary  Gonadal Hormone Regulation in Females      LH acts on the Theca Cells to increase the production of androgens, namely androstenedione.              Androstenedione can be converted to either Estrone or Testosterone, which can then be converted to Estradiol by Aromatase.              FSH acts on the Granulosa Cells to stimulate aromatase activity.              FSH is regulated in a somewhat complex fashion by estradiol → high estradiol causes negative feedback in the short-term, but this transitions to a feed-forward response after a time delay.                                         LH        FSH                            Acts on        Theca Cells        Granulosa Cells                    Mechanism of Action        Increased intracellular cAMP        Increased intracellular cAMP                    Effects        Increased Androstenedione synthesis        Increased Aromatase Activity              Make sure you compare this to the similar chart that was shown in the previous lecture.  You can also see it below:  Gonadal Hormone Regulation in Males      LH acts on the Leydig Cells to increase the activity of P450 Side Chain Cleavage.              This increases steroidogenesis, and ultimately, testosterone levels.        Testosterone then inhibits LH production.              FSH acts on the Sertoli Cells to stimulate a number of functions, including synthesis of ABP.              FSH also stimulates the production of Inhibin.

To describe the structure and role of Sertoli cells.  To explain the location and function of Leydig cell.Introduction  The HPO axis is basically the same in females as in males → GnRH stimulates hypothalamic LH and FSH release, which then affects the gonads.          The difference arises in the effects of these hormones once they reach their end destination.      For this lecture, and the following lecture, focus on how LH and FSH differ in their effects and regulation.        FSH is more important in maintaining female function compared to male function.          In males, where FSH is undesired, FSH is severely inhibited by inhibins, which are produced in the testes.      Anatomy of the Testis  The key functional unit of the testis is the seminiferous tubule.          These are convoluted tubes which function like an ‘assembly line’ that constantly produces spermatozoa.        These spermatozoa then collect in the rete testis (shown right, at 6), which then feeds into Ductuli Efferents (aka. efferent ductules), which carry the spermatozoa out of the testis.  The spermatozoa then move through a long tortuous tubular structure called the epididymis.          When the spermatozoa first enter the epididymis, they are not yet motile → they must develop there for a period of time before they are functional.      The epididymis also functions as a warehouse → spermatozoa can lie in wait in it for up to two weeks (the amount of time varies depending on whether you’re in a ‘dry spell’ or not heh heh).        When the spermatozoa are ‘called to action’, they rapidly move out of the epididymis out into the vas deferens.          They then meet the prostate, seminal vesicles, etc, as we saw in Anatomy &amp; Development of the Male Genitalia.      Histology of the Testis  Above is a cross-section of a testis, cutting through multiple loops of a seminiferous tubule.  The Sertoli Cells are the epithelial cells that line the seminiferous tubule.  Between the Sertoli cells are spermatogenic cells at different stages of maturation.          Maturation occurs from the outside to the inside; the most mature spermatids are located in the lumen, and the least mature ones are at the periphery.        The Leydig Cells lie in the interstitial space, outside of the seminiferous tubules.  Remember      Sertoli Cells line the seminiferous tubules.    Leydig Cells lie in the interstitial space.    Spermatids are least developed at the periphery of the tubule, and are most developed at the lumen.  Spermatogenesis  Spermatozoa originate from primordial germ cells, which then develop into ‘committed’ spermatogonia.          These reside in the basolateral surface of the seminiferous tubule (away from the lumen).        Spermatogonia are still mitotically active → they only enter into meisosis once they become primary spermatocytes.          The transition to a primary spermatocyte is demarcated by a movement from the ‘outside compartment’ of the Sertoli cell into the ‘inside compartment’ of the Sertoli cell.      In other words, as the spermatogonia develops into a primary spermatocyte, it will cross the blood-testis barrier.        The blood-testis barrier is maintained by tight junctions between the Sertoli cells.  Once the primary spermatocyte get out of the blood-testis barrier, it becomes meiotically active.          In males, meiosis is symmetric. With the first meiotic division, you produce 2 secondary spermatocytes, and with the second meiotic division, you produce 4 spermatids.        After this, we have spermiogenesis, where these haploid spermatids are remodeled to become fusiform torpedos of terror.The Blood-Testis Barrier  How does the sister cell from the spermatogonia get through the tight junction and become a primary spermatocyte?          The tight junctions between the Sertoli cells actually break down and move.      There is a sequential formation and destruction of the tight junctions, to move cells out of the blood testis barrier.        When a spermatogonia breaks out of the blood-testis barrier, the tight junction in front of it breaks down, and another tight junction forms behind it.          This prevents exposure of other spermatogonia to the external environment (which results in a transition from mitosis to meiosis).        The blood-testis barrier allows for the maintenance of a basal compartment and an apical compartment.          As mentioned before, it’s thought that these different milieus maintain mitotic and meiotic activity respectively.      Spermiogenesis  How does a haploid spermatid become a spermatozoa?          An acrosomal vesicle forms:                  The golgi apparatus develops into something callled an acrosomal vesicle, which becomes the head of the spermatozoa.          This acrosomal vesicle contains proteolytic enzymes that are critical to penetrating the oocyte cell membrane.                    A flagellum forms:                  The flagellum is microtubule-dense, and grows from centromeres. Centromeres contain a complex called γ-TuRC that helps nucleate microtubules.                    Excess cytoplasm is discarded:                  This forms a residual body.                    Mitochondria localize to a mitochondrial sheath:                  Mitochondria collect near the start of the flagellum, and become encapsulated in a mitochondrial sheath.          These provide the ATP that is required for the flagellum to move.                    The haploid chromosomal component is tightly packed:                  Normally, DNA is wound in histones, which modulate gene expression.          However, since the DNA in a spermatozoa isn’t active, it can be packaged to save space.          So there are special DNA binding proteins called protamines, which replace the histones, and result in a very tight packing of the DNA.                    Pathologic Conditions Affecting Spermatogenesis  High Temperature (eg. body temperature) → spermatogenesis requires cooler-than-body temperatures to function optimally, which is why the testes are external.          In patients with cryptorchidism, descent of the testes fails, so the higher internal body temperatures will inhibit spermatogenesis.        Varicocele → abnormal dilation of the pampiniform venous plexus, affecting temperature regulation of the testes.  Chemotherapy → many chemo drugs inhibit components of cell division, thus affecting spermatogenesis.          Once chemotherapy has been stopped, dormant stem cells (which aren’t as mitotically active) can then repopulate the seminiferous tubules.        Mumps → in adults, will often cause acute orchitis (inflammation of the testes).  Testicular Torsion → disruption of blood supply due to physical trauma or abnormally mobile testis within the tunica vaginalis.Steroids and Steroidogenesis  Steroid → terpenoid lipid; carbon skeleton with 4 fused rings, generally arranged in a 6-6-6-5 fashion.          They differ in what functional groups are attached to these rings, and the oxidation state of the rings.        Steroidogenesis is rate-limited:          The enzymatic rate limiting step of steroid synthesis is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone.                  This occurs inside the mitochondria, by an enzyme called P450 Side Chain Cleavage (P450 SCC).                    The ACTUAL rate limiting step is the activity of StAR (which as we saw before was Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein).                  StAR mediates the import of cholesterol into the mitochondria.          Without cholesterol import, P450 SCC can’t convert anything into pregnenolone!                    However, for exam purposes, just remember that P450 SCC conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is the rate-limiting step.        Cholesterol is the precursor of all steroid hormones:          Most cholesterol is obtained from the blood, but it can also be synthesized from acetate within the Leydig cells.       P450 SCC mediated conversion of cholesterol is regulated by LH levels.      In response to increased LH, LH receptors on Leydig cells stimulate an increase in cAMP, which results in increased P450 SCC activity.        The first step in the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone is P450 SCC.  The last step in the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone is 17-β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase.  17-β-HSD converts androstenedione (which, as we recall, was an adrenal androgen) into testosterone.Testosterone Release &amp; Transportation  Testosterone is not stored in the testis. It rapidly diffuses into the blood, down its concentration gradient.  Since testosterone is a steroid hormone, it must be bound to a binding protein in order to be water soluble.          The most common binding proteins are (1) albumin, and (2) SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Protein).        Just like with cortisol, bound testosterone is biologically inactive; only the unbound hormone is active.  Protein binding of testosterone serves several useful functions:          Makes it water soluble.      Protects testosterone from breakdown.      Acts as a storage form for testosterone.      Gonadal Hormone Regulation in Males  In males, LH and FSH have different functions than in females.          Their names — Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone — are derived from their actions in the ovary, not the testis.        Both LH and FSH are glycoproteins with two subunits. Their alpha subunits are the same; their beta subunits determine their biological activity.  In the male, the mechanism of action of both is via cAMP:          LH acts on the Leydig cells to increase the activity of P450 SCC, which increases steroid synthesis in the testis.  Androgen Binding Protein (ABP) has the same amino-acid sequence as SHBG, but differs in its post-translational modification.      FSH acts on the Sertoli cells to stimulate a number of functions including synthesis of Androgen Binding Protein.        Sertoli cells produce inhibin in response to FSH.          Inhibin inhibits pituitary responsiveness to GnRH in FSH producing cells.      Hence, it acts as negative feedback for FSH production.        Both LH and FSH are controlled by GnRH, but their secretion is independent:          LH secretion is negatively regulated by testosterone.      FSH secretion is negatively regulated by inhibin.        Gonadal Hormone Regulation in Males      LH acts on the Leydig Cells to increase the activity of P450 Side Chain Cleavage.              This increases steroidogenesis, and ultimately, testosterone levels.        Testosterone then inhibits LH production.              FSH acts on the Sertoli Cells to stimulate a number of functions, including synthesis of ABP.              FSH also stimulates the production of Inhibin.        Inhibin then inhibits FSH production.                                         LH        FSH                            Acts on        Leydig Cells        Sertoli Cells                    Mechanism of Action        Increased intracellular cAMP        Increased intracellular cAMP                    Effects        Increased activity of P450 SCC        Many; includes synthesis of ABP                    Inhibited by        Testosterone        Inhibin            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/reproduction/2014/11/12/male-reproductive-physiology.html"},
	{"title": "Histology &amp; Pathology of Female &amp; Male Reproductive Tracts", "text": "The VulvaAnatomy of the Vulva  Vulva → external female genitalia.          Comprises: mons pubis, labia majora and minora, clitoris, vestibule      Vestibule: tissue enclosed by labia minora; includes urethra, vaginal opening, Bartholin’s and Skene’s glands.        Glands:          Bartholin’s glands → posterolateral to the vaginal entrance; secretes mucous.      Skene’s glands → paired peri-urethral glands; mucus secreting        Labia majora → keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and eccrine, apocrine and sebaceous glands;.  Labia minora → nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium.  Remember      Bartholin’s Glands → paired, postero-lateral to the vaginal entrance.    Skene’s Glands → paired, periurethral.  Histology of the Vulva  Lined by stratified squamous epithelium, just like the skin.  Pathology:          The vulva can have a spectrum of inflammatory lesions.      Can include opaque, while, scaly, plaque like mucosal thickenings.      Vulvar discomfort and itching may be present.        Leukoplakia → a white, scaly, raised plaque. This is not specific to the vulva!          This is a clinical, descriptive term, not a diagnosis.       It may indicate a variety of lesions (benign, premalignant, or malignant). To obtain a definitive diagnosis, you need a biopsy.      To the right is an example of leukoplakia of the vulva.        Something that may seem the same upon physical exam may be pathologically very different.  Below are two examples of leukoplakia, one which was a benign lichen sclerosus, and the other which was a malignant squamous cell carcinoma.          Importantly, since the vulva is covered in squamous cells, it’s a possible site for squamous cell carcinomas!      The Vagina  The vagina is also lined by squamous mucosa.  It’s a fibromuscular tube, with 3 layers:            Mucosa → non-keratinizing, squamous epithelium.      Muscularis → comprised of an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal smooth muscle later, much like the esophagus (and the opposite of the ureter).      Adventitia → loose connective tissue with elastic fibres.        This is the same basic structure as the esophagus and ureter.The Cervix  Recall that the cervix is the lower part of the uterus.  The histology of the cell lining changes at the level of the cervix, namely at the external os.          The exocervix on the outside has stratified squamous epithelium.      The endocervix on the inside has simple columnar epithelium.        You don’t always see the endocervix from the outside of the external os.          However, the border between the two is what you need to sample when you perform a pap-smear → you need to find the transformation zone.        Below is a figure that more clearly demarcates this histological transformation.  Why does this transformation occur?          Recall that the vagina is of a different embryological origin as the uterus → the vagina arises from the urogenital sinus, while the uterus arises from the fusion of the paramesonephric ducts.      Hence, it makes sense that they differ histologically.        Why do you sample the transformation zone with a pap-smear?          This is an area with increased cell turnover, so this is where abnormalities in replication caused by the virus will most easily be seen.      Dysplastic/malignant cells will be best seen here.        What will you see histologically at the transformation zone?          Ectocervical cells → stratified squamous cells, polygonal shape.      Endocervical cells → columnar cells.        Both of these must be seen histologically for a proper pap smear to have been performed.          Neoplastic ectocervical cells would suggest a squamous cell carcinoma, since they’re stratified squamous cells.      Neoplastic endocervical cells would suggest an adenocarcinoma, since they’re simple columnar cells.        Examples of these cell types can be seen below.The Uterus  Similar to the vagina, the lining of the uterus comprises of 3 layers, which we saw in Anatomy of the Female Reproductive Tract:          Endometrium &amp;rarr mucosal lining of the uterus.      Myometrium → fibromuscular wall.      Perimetrium → peritoneal lining, blends with the broad ligament of the uterus.      Endometrium  The endometrium is divided into two zones based on their involvement during the menstrual cycle:          Basalis → the bottom layer that is not sloughed off with each menstrual cycle.      Functionalis → the luminal layer that is sloughed off during each menstrual cycle.        During the cycling of the endometrium, there are 3 phases:          Proliferative → the endometrium is building up. Histologically, you’ll see mitoses in the glands and stroma.                  As an aside, if you see too many glands with respect to the stroma, it can be suggestive of endometrial hyperplasia, which is a precursor to an adenocarcinoma.                     Secretory → vacuoles form, which secrete materials that prepare for potential fertilization.                  Can be differentiated histologically from proliferative endometrium by the presence of a piano-key effect, due the formation of vacuoles.          The presence of secretory endometrium is also a sign that ovulation has occurred. Hence, endometrial biopsies are often taken to help DDx infertility.                    Menstrual → sloughing of the stratum functionalis.      Endometrial Biopsies  As mentioned before, an endometrial biopsy can be done to look for secretory endometrium as a sign of ovulation in infertile/dysmenorrheic patients.  Generally, endometrial biopsies are indicated for the following:          Evaluation of infertile/dysmenorrheic patients.      Endometrial cells identified on routine pap smears.      Post-menopausal bleeding to investigate for malignancy.                  Post-menopausal bleeding is malignant until proven otherwise!          You normally shouldn’t be bleeding once you don’t have periods anymore.                      It’s particular important to write down the date of the last period:          If it’s only been a few days since the past period, then it’s normal to still be sloughing off endometrial cells.      If it’s longer than that, it’s abnormal to see endometrial cells in the pap smear.        Other important information to include on the requisition:          Patient age, date, and characteristics of their last menstrual period, exogenous hormone ingestion, chief complaint, and physical findings.        Remember      Post-menopausal bleeding is malignant until proven otherwise!  Endometriosus  Endometriosus → the presence of endometrial glands and stroma in abnormal locations outside of the uterus.  Common finding → seen in 10% of fertile women (ie. usually from 20s-40s).  Typical locations → ovaries, uterine ligaments, rectovaginal septum, pelvic peritoneum, at laparotomy scars.          Rarely, can be seen at umbilicus, vagina, vulva, and appendix.        Clinical signs → infertility, dysmenorrhea (painful periods), pelvic pain.  Theories → multiple theories as to why this happens:          Some people think that the ectopic endometrial tissue implants when the tissue sloughed off during the period ends up implanting in an abnormal place.      Others think that the endometrial tissue arises from metaplasia of the tissue of the gynecological tract.      Finally, some people think that there could be vascular/lymphatic dissemination of the endometrial tissue.        When endometriosus occurs at the ovary, it’s referred to as a chocolate cyst.            Because the tissue behaves as if it’s still cycling, blood will accumulate inside the cyst.      This is what makes the cyst have its characteristic, ‘chocolatey’ insides.      Although these are benign, they can be quite symptomatic for patients.      Myometrium  One common myometrial lesion is a leiomyoma (aka. a fibroid)          These can be embedded in the wall, in the outside serosa, or even in the endometrial cavity.      Fibroids do not become malignant, although they can grow large enough to cause compressive symptoms.        The size of the nodule does not correlate with the prognosis:          Fibroids can be very big, and can even cause compressive symptoms, but they’ll never turn malignant.      On the other hand, you can have a tiny nodule with a much poorer prognosis, particularly if it has cancerous histological features (hemorrhagic, ill defined borders, central necrosis, etc.)      The malignant counterpart of a leiomyoma is called a leiomyosarcoma, and it has a very poor prognosis and a high mortality.        Remember      Leiomyomas (fibroids) are benign, and almost never transform into malignant tumours.    Leiomyosarcomas are malignant, and have a poor prognosis.  Above is a histological image of a leiomyoma. Note that the cells of the leiomyoma are the same as the surrounding myometrium (you can somewhat see the demarcating border). This is because fibroids are just a benign proliferation of the myometrial cells, with no cellular change.Adenomyosis  Adenomyosis → presence of endometrial tissue in the myometrium (ie, in the uterine wall).          In that sense, it’s sort of like endometriosus in that there’s ectopic endometrial tissue.      It differs from endometriosus in the sense that this ectopic tissue is still in the uterus; it’s just in the wrong layer.        Common finding → seen in 15-30% of all uteri.  Pathophysiology → thought to be that during labour, when the uterus is contracting, some of the endometrial glands become displaced into the myometrium.          Hence, adenomyosis is less common in women who have not gone through labour.        Endometriosus vs Adenomysosis      Endometriosus → ectopic endometrial tissue outside the uterus.    Adenomyosis → ectopic endometrial tissue within the uterus (ie, in the myometrium).  The Fallopian Tubes  As seen in Anatomy of the Female Reproductive Tract, the fallopian tube has the following parts:          Uterine → the part that merges with the uterus.      Isthmus → the long part.      Ampulla → where the tube begins to widen.      Infundibulum → the funnel shaped end of the ampulla.      Fimbriae → the finger like projections of the fallopian tube that surround the ovary.        Fertilization actually usually takes place in the ampulla:          It’s a common misconception that fertilization usually occurs in the uterus.      Although this may happen, it’s more typical in the ampulla. Hence, fertilization and implantation are discrete events.      Hence, if there are any abnormalities in the fallopian tubes, you have issues with the sperm moving up to fertilize the egg, or with the fertilized egg moving down to implant into the ovary.        Just like most tubal structures, the fallopian tubes have a serosa, muscularis and mucosal layer.          The peristaltic movement of the muscularis layer is particularly important for transport of the sperm and oocyte.      The mucosal surface have cilia which also help with the movement of the gametes.      Salpingitis  Salpinx is greek for ‘trumpet’, and is used anatomically to refer to the fallopian tube (eg. with hysterosalpingography, mesosalpinx, etc).  Hence salpingitis is inflammation of the fallopian tube.  Long term, this inflammatory response can cause fibrosis of the fallopian tubes, increasing the risk of infertility and tubal ectopic pregnancies.Endosalpingiosis  Endosalpingiosis → ectopic fallopian tube epithelium outside of the fallopian tube.  This is the fallopian tube analog of endometriosus.  Usually on the ovarian surface, close to the fimbriae.      May follow surgery, or be associated with salpingitis.    Endosalpingiosis can cause studding on the surface of the ovary:          These small ‘nipple-like’ lesions are referred to as Psammoma bodies (seen below).      Psammoma bodies can be seen in a number of other conditions, on other tissues (one example that we’ve seen before is with papillary thyroid cancer).        When you see these on the surface of the ovary, it can be 2 things:          It can represent malignant metastases (tumour implantation).      It can also be endosalpingiosis (benign).        Hence, in the context of a surgery to remove an ovarian cancer, a pathologist is heavily involved in determining whether metastasis has occurred, or whether it’s only endosalpingiosis.The Ovary  The ovary produces oocytes, and secretes hormones.  It comprises a cortex and a medulla.          Cortex → connective tissue stroma with follicles.      Medulla → loose connective tissue with vessels.        After ovulation, the remaining follicular tissue forms the corpus luteum.            The corpus luteum is formed by both granulosa cells and theca cells, which produce progesterone and estrogen.      If the oocyte is not fertilized, hormone secretion by the corpus luteum ceases by around 14 days after ovulation. In this case, the corpus luteum degenerates into a corpus albicans, and eventually gets reabsorbed.      If the oocyte is fertilized, it’ll release hCG, which tells the corpus luteum to persist.      The Male Reproductive System  We’ve seen all of this before in Male Reproductive Physiology. Please read the material from that lecture for a complete review.  As seen before, maturation occurs peripherally to luminally.  You can see how this looks histologically below.          Note that the lumen is filled with spermatozoa, with evident flagella.        Within each seminiferous tubule are Sertoli cells; outside of them are the Leydig cells.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/reproduction/2014/11/11/histology-pathology-female-male-reproductive-tract.html"},
	{"title": "Functional Sexual Anatomy", "text": "  Functional Sexual Anatomy Notes      See Functional Sexual Anatomy Notes.  Lecture Objectives  Given the structure of the penis and clitoris, state the role of “erectile tissue” in erection.  Describe the importance of the relationship of the blood and nerve supply of the penis and clitoris to the surrounding perineal fascia.  Explain how a prostatectomy might affect erectile function in the male.  Explain how a spinal cord injury might affect erectile function in the male.  State the changes that occur in the female genitalia (other than the clitoris) and the breast in the female sexual response.Introduction &amp; Review Questions  For this lecture, we’ll be discussing functional sexual anatomy.          In other words, we’ll be discussing the anatomy of sex, and what structures, blood vessels, and nerves, mediate the sexual response.      We’ll be focusing primarily on the male system.        What’s the difference between the pelvic diaphragm and the urogenital diaphragm?          Pelvic Diaphragm → comprised of the levator ani and coccygeus, supports pelvic viscera.      Urogenital Diaphragm → in perineum (the deep perineal space), oriented horizontally (since it’s in the urogenital triangle), and has the sphincter urethrae sandwiched inside.                  Recall that this not only surrounds the urethra, but also the vagina, in females.          The prostate sits on top of it in males; the bladder in females.                      What layer of superficial fascia is continuous with the fascia of the perineum?          Scarpa’s fascia.      Structure of the Penis  The penis hangs off of the urogenital diaphragm.  It’s supported by the suspensory ligament of the penis, which attaches it to the pubic symphysis.  Regions of the penis include the (1) root, the (2) shaft (body), and (3) glans.          Each contains erectile tissue, which can swell as a result of becoming engorged with blood.      The root includes the bulb and the right and left crus.      The bulb is covered with the bulbospongiosus muscle.        On the dorsal surface, you have 2 corpus cavernosa, which are regions of erectile tissue that become the most engorged during an erection.          Each corpus cavernosum is dorsal to the spongy urethra, as seen to the right.        Below is what things look like in the real thing.  Note the suspensory ligament, which attaches to the pubic symphysis.  Also note how the root is comprised of the right and left crus, and the bulb.  As was seen above, you can effectively split the penis into two components:          One component is formed by the right and left crus, which become the two corpus cavernosa.                  Recall that the ischiocavernosus covers the R &amp; L crus.                    The other component is formed by the bulb of the penis, which becomes the corpus spongiosum, and eventually goes to the glans.                  Recall that the bulbocavernosus is what covers the bulb here.          The urethra travels in here as well.                      The glans of the penis is normally covered in foreskin (which is known as prepuce). The prepuce is anchored to the glans by the frenulum.          The raised margin between the glans of the penis and the shaft is known as the corona (aptly, latin for ‘crown’).        Below, we see the muscular coverings at the base of the penis in more detail.  In addition to the ischiocavernosus and the bulbospongiosus, here we also see the superficial transverse perineal muscles.  Note the attachment of some of these muscles to the perineal body.Image Review  The urogenital diaphragm is shown to the right, outlined in black.  The prostate sits on top of the UG diaphragm, so it’s the object outlined in green.  The levator ani is part of the pelvic diaphragm, which lies above the UG diaphragm, so it’s in red.  The bulb of the penis and the two crus are in blue, hanging off the UG diaphragm.Fascial Linings of the Penis  As we saw before, Colle’s/Darto’s fascia is continuous with Scarpa’s fascia.  Deep to this fascia, there’s the deep penile fascia, aka. Buck’s fascia.  Deep to Buck’s fascia, we have a thicker, fibrous wrapping called the tunica albuginea, that surrounds the erectile tissue itself.          None of the fascial layers are particularly thick, except for that tunica albuginea.        Fascial coverings of the Penis and Scrotum      From superficial to deep, we have:              Colle’s/Darto’s fascia.        Buck’s fascia.        Tunica Albuginea.              Note that the tunica albuginea mainly surrounds the two corpus cavernosa, with a septum in between. There is also tunica albuginea surrounding the corpus spongiosum, but it’s not as thick and fibrous.  Buck’s fascia wraps around the entire penis, superficial to the tunica albuginea.  Colle’s fascia is most superficial, and is covered only by skin.  This is better seen below:Blood Vessels of the Penis  On the dorsal surface of the penis, we have one deep dorsal vein, flanked by two deep dorsal arteries.          The deep dorsal vein drains into the internal pudendal vein.      The deep dorsal artery drains into the internal pudendal artery.        Alongside these, we have the dorsal nerve:          As we saw before, this was a branch off the pudendal nerve, and provides sensory innervation only (no motor innervation).        Deep to these vessels, within the corpus cavernosa, lie deep arteries, also known as cavernous arteries (since they’re in the cavernous tissue).  These blood vessels arise from the internal pudendal artery and vein:  As we saw before, the pudendal artery follows the same path as the pudendal nerve:          It exits the greater sciatic notch.      It re-enters the lesser sciatic notch.      It moves along the pudendal canal, which runs along the ischial tuberosity.      It gives off inferior rectal branches.      It gives off perineal branches.      It gives off penile branches                   These include the deep arteries (cavernous arteries), and the dorsal arteries.                      The chart below describes how these blood vessels are interdigitated within the fascial linings.          It’s important to note the the superficial dorsal vein is not the same as the deep dorsal vein → there are actually two dorsal veins, separated by Buck’s fascia.      Also, note that the bulbar and spongiosal branches of the internal pudendal were some of the perineal branches that we described before.        Relationship of Blood Vessels &amp; Fascia                    Location        Contents                            Between Colle’s Fascia and Buck’s Fascia        (Superficial) dorsal vein                    Between Buck’s Fascia and Tunica Albuginea        Deep dorsal arteries, deep dorsal vein, dorsal nerve                    In corpus cavernosus        Cavernous (deep) artery                    In bulb and corpus spongiosum        Bulbar and spongiosal branches of the internal pudendal            Physiology of Erections  During engorgement, the deep arteries in the corpus cavernosa fill up with blood.  This blood fills up small helicine arteries within the corpus cavernosa, which causes blood to dump into the erectile tissue.  This is what causes an erection!  Why doesn’t the blood leave via the venous system?          Mechanically, the venous return gets blocked, because the deep dorsal vein gets squished between Buck’s fascia and the tunica albuginea, by the raging erection.      Physiologically, the AV shunt gets blocked due to the vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide.        When you become flaccid again, venous return can resume, and the blood returns via the prostatic venous plexus.Nervous Control  We have sympathetic, parasympathetic, and autonomic control.  Parasympathetic:          Responsible for erections.      As mentioned before, this is via the pelvic splanchnics, S2,3,4.      Also goes through the inferior hypogastric plexus, along with the sympathetics.      The nerves that go to the penis course along the prostatic sheath through the prostatic plexus.                  As a result, patients who undergo a prostatectomy are at risk of having erectile dysfunction.                    They finish at cavernous nerves that enter the corpus cavernosa of the penis.        Sympathetic:          Responsible for ejaculation.      As mentioned before, these come from L1-L2, and pass through the inferior hypogastric plexus.      They run with the parasympathetics, get into the perineum, and supply the glandular tissues.        Somatic:          Help with ejaculation.      As mentioned before, this is via the pudendal nerve, which runs from S2,3,4.      Contract the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles at the end of ejaculation to help squirt semen.        Remember      Since the parasympathetics (which are responsible for erections), pass through the prostatic sheath, a prostatectomy can put patients at risk for erectile dysfunction.  The Male Sexual Response1. Erection  In the male, an erection can be stimulated by both psychogenic stimuli, and reflexogenic stimuli.          Psychogenic → visual, mental, and other stimuli. In other words, sexy stuff.      Reflexogenic → physical stimulation of the genitals. One example is via the dorsal nerve (off the pudendal), since it provides sensory innervation to the dorsal penis.        Once the brain receives these stimuli, it calls for an erection by sending parasympathetic signals.          In other words, you need parasympathetic innervation in order to be able to develop an erection.      If you had damage to the dorsal branch of the pudendal nerve, you may have issues with the reflexogenic response, but you would still have a normal psychogenic response because that pathway would be intact.      2. Orgasm → Emission  The beginning of ejaculation is under sympathetic control.  These sympathetic signals stimulate the prostate, seminal vesicles, etc.  They tell them to contract and release spermatozoa and seminal fluid.2. Orgasm → Ejaculation  With ejaculation, you require (1) constriction of the spincter urethrae to block off bladder and urine, as well as (2) contraction of the perineal muscles.  This is done via the pudendal nerve (somatic control).  In other words, the end of an orgasm requires both sympathetic innervation and somatic innervation.  The Rise and Fall of the Penis (ehehehe)      Parasympathetics are responsible for erection.    Sympathetics are responsible for ejaculation.    Somatic innervation (pudendal) help with ejaculation.    Remember this by thinking Point and Shoot (P for parasympathetic, S for sympathetic).

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Perineum", "text": "  Perineum Anatomy Notes      See Perineum Anatomy Notes.    Objective      Define perineum and its boundaries.    Perineum → ‘The diamond shaped area between the legs’.          Lies inferior to the pelvic diaphragm, which we saw in Anatomy of the Pelvis.      The anterior tip of the diamond is the pubic symphysis.      The posterior tip of the diamond is the coccyx.      The lateral tips of the diamond are formed by the ischial tuberosities.      The edges of the diamond are formed by the inferior pubic rami anteriorly, and the sacrotuberous ligaments posteriorly.        The perineum is separated into 2 triangles:          Urogenital Triangle → anterior triangle that contains the urogenital structures.      Anal Triangle → posterior triangle that contains the anal structures.        The midpoint between the two triangles is the perineal body.          The perineal body is where a lot of the pelvic floor and perineal muscles attach.      You can see the attachments of these muscles below.        These two triangles are not coplanar → the urogenital plane is horizontal to the plane of the body, while the anal plane is oblique.Urogenital Triangle  Objective      Describe the compartments of the urogenital triangle.    The urogenital triangle is divided into 2 ‘pouches’.          These aren’t really the cavernous pouches that we’re accustomed to; they’re more like 2 separate regions.        These pouches are:          Deep Perineal Pouch → lies just inferior to the pelvic diaphragm.                  It contains the urogenital diaphragm, and its associated glands.                    Superficial Perineal Pouch → this lies superficially over the deep perineal pouch.                  It contains the genitalia, the nerves and vessels that feed it, and fascial linings (Colle’s Fascia).                    Superficial Perineal Pouch  Objective      Define the boundaries and structures of Superficial Perineal Pouch.  Lining of the Superficial Perineal Pouch  The superficial perineal pouch is lined with Colle’s fascia (aka. superficial perineal fascia).          Recall from GI that this was continuous with Scarpa’s fascia, coming down from the anterior abdominal wall.      This is outlined in blue below.        The superficial pouch also contains the genitalia, as described before.The superficial perineal pouch in a female. This is the region demarcated by Colle's fascia. Note that the deep perineal pouch is where the urogenital diaphragm is (deep to Colle's fascia).Here is the same diagram, except in a male.Muscles of the Superficial Perineal Pouch  Below, the skin and Colle’s fascia have been removed, so you can better see the structures contained in the superficial perineal pouch.  These are small muscles that cover the erectile tissue in both the male and the female:          Bulbospongiosus muscle → this covers the bulb of the penis in the male, and the bulb of vestibule in the female.                   Hence, it’s called the bulbo-spongiosus.          The -spongiosus arises from the fact that it’s made of spongy erectile tissue.                    Ischiocavernosus muscle → covers the right and left crus.                  In the male, this comes up and forms part of the penis.          In the female, this comes up and meets with the clitoris.          Ischio- since it comes off the ischium, and -cavernosus since it’s made of cavernous erectile tissue.                    Superficial Transverse Perineal Muscle                  Small muscles; these meet medially at the perineal body.                      These muscles help with sexual intercourse and voiding           They contract around the bulb and help contract the erectile tissues of the right and left crus.      Note that they’re not responsible for inducing erection → this is due to vascular engorgement.      Female Contents of the Superficial Perineal Pouch  In addition to the fascia and muscles described above, in the female, the vulva is located in the superficial perineal pouch as well.  The vulva is comprised of:          Labia Majora.      Labia Minora.      Clitoris.      Vestibule.        Surrounding the bulb of the vestibule is the bulbospongiosus muscle, as was described before.  After removing the muscle, you can see both the bulb of the vestibule, and the greater vestibular glands (aka. Bartholin’s glands), which lie further posterior.          The greater vestibular glands secrete into the vaginal opening.         Clinical Note      One application of this anatomy in the female is with an episiotomy.    An episiotomy is often done to widen the birth canal.          It involves making an incision, either midline or oblique, to the allow for the baby to exit more easily.      It was thought that this would prevent tearing, the idea being that a nice clean cut with a scalpel would heal better than a jagged tear.      However, research has shown that this isn’t the case, and the procedure is very controversial (some doctors will do it; others won’t).        What would you cut if you made a midline incision?          Going through the midline, you would cut the perineal body, which is not good since many muscles attach to it.      If you went too far, you’d be at risk of cutting the anal sphincter, which is also very bad.        What would you cut if you made an oblique incision?          Usually the (1) bulbospongiosus muscle and the (2) superficial transverse perineal muscle.      These usually heal better, so it’s typically better to do an oblique incision (or nothing at all).        Clinical Note      One application of this anatomy in the male is with an straddle injury.    A straddle injury is an injury to the crotch area that occurs when a person falls while straddling an object (like a bike seat).          This will cause damage to the spongy urethra, and possible tearing of the bulb of the penis.      This may result in leakage of blood or urine into the superficial perineal pouch.      Since this pouch is lined by Colle’s fascia, which is continuous with both Darto’s fascia (lines the scrotum and penis) and Scarpa’s fascia (lines the lower abdomen), this fluid can actually track up into scrotum and penis, as well as the abdominal area.        Remember      Colle’s Fascia → lines the superficial perineal pouch.    Darto’s Fascia → lines penis and scrotum.    Both of these are continuous with Scarpa’s fascia, meaning that a leak into the superficial perineal pouch can track into the abdomen.    Objective      Describe the course of the Pudendal Nerve.    The pudendal nerve provides somatic innervation to the superficial perineal pouch.          It arises from S2,3,4, and comes out of the sacral plexus.      It leaves the plexus thorugh a notch called the greater sciatic notch, and then immediately enters the perineum through the lesser sciatic notch.                  This pattern of ‘going out, and then back in’, is characteristic of the pudendal nerve.                    It runs in the pudendal canal, which follows the ischial tuberosity, and then it gives off branches:                  Inferior Rectal, which supplies the:                          Rectum.              External Anal Sphincter.                                Perineal Branches, which supply:                          Sensory innervation to the scrotal/labial area.              Muscles of the deep and superficial perineum (bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus, superficial transverse perineal, etc.).                                Dorsal Nerve, which supplies sensory innervation only to either the clitoris or the penis.                    It’s important to note that the inferior rectal branches and the perineal branches supply both motor and sensory innervation, while the dorsal nerve provides sensory innervation only.        Remember      The pudendal nerve provides somatic innervation to the perineum.    It (1) arises from S2,3,4, from the sacral plexus, (2) exits through the greater sciatic notch, and then (3) re-enters through the lesser sciatic notch into the perineum.    It then runs along the pudendal canal, before it gives off branches:              Inferior Rectal → motor and sensory to the rectum and external anal sphincter.        Perineal → motor and sensory to the scrotal/labial area, and muscles of the perineum.        Dorsal Nerve → sensory innervation only to the penis/clitoris.              Clinical Note      A pudendal nerve block is often done to anesthetize only the perineum.    A pudendal nerve block will affect the perineum, but not the rest of the vaginal canal, or the uterus.  There are 2 landmarks for performing a pudendal nerve block, depending on the route.            Ischial spine → this is a trans-vaginal approach.                  You palpate the ischial spine from within the vagina.          An example of this is shown to the right.                    Ischial tuberosity → this is a perineal approach.                  You palpate the iscial tuberosity externally, through the buttock.          This is used if you can’t do a trans-vaginal approach (for instance if a woman is giving birth).                      The pudendal nerve isn’t the only nerve that supplies the perineum → for complete anesthesia of the perineum, the ilioinguinal and the posterior cutaneous nerves must also be blocked.          However, usually a pudendal nerve block provides sufficient anesthesia.        Objective      Describe the course of the internal pudendal artery and vein.    The internal pudendal artery is the main blood supply to the perineum.          It comes off of the internal iliac artery.      It also has a corresponding vein → the internal pudendal vein.        The internal pudendal artery follows the course of the pudendal nerve.          In other words, exactly like we saw before, it:                  Goes out the greater sciatic notch.          Comes back in through the lesser sciatic notch.          Tracks along the pudendal canal.          Gives off rectal branches.          Gives off perineal branches.          Gives off a dorsal artery to the penis/clitoris.                    One difference here is that the internal pudendal also gives off a deep artery to the penis, along with the more superficial dorsal artery (in the male, of course).      Deep Perineal Pouch  Objective      Define Deep Perineal Pouch (Space) and its contents.    The deep perineal pouch is much smaller than the superficial perineal pouch. It comprises of the urogenital diaphragm.          Urogenital diaphragm → a partition (hence, diaphragm), that consists of 2 layers of membrane, with a muscle in between.      In other words, the urogenital diaphragm is a muscle sandwich.      In the female, the bladder sits of top of the UG diaphragm; in the male, it’s the prostate.        The components of this ‘muscle sandwich’ are:          Perineal membrane on the superficial side.      Voluntary muscle → the nature of this varies by gender.      Deep perineal fascia on the deep side.        The voluntary muscles of the UG diaphragm are innervated by the perineal branches of the pudendal nerve, and include:          Sphincter urethrae.                  The sphincter urethrae wraps around the urethra and prevents urination.          In females, it also loops around the vagina, and joins with the transverse perineal muscle. Hence, it also helps compress and support the vagina.                    Deep transverse perineal muscles.        Clinical Note      Deep pouch injuries are rarer than superficial pouch injuries, and have a different presentation.    Deep pouch injuries are rarer, and often involve trauma to the pelvis itself (such as a fracture).          Here, there is tearing of the urethra as it moves from deep to superficial, so fluid ends up accumulating at the urogenital diaphragm.      Since this is at the deep pouch, and not the superficial pouch, fluid will spill up into the pelvis, instead of into Colle’s fascia.        What this means is that fluid tracks different with deep pouch injuries than with superficial pouch injuries.          A superficial pouch injury (eg. a straddle injury) can track up the abdominal wall.      A deep pouch injury will track into the pelvis, and won’t enter the abdominal cavity (it’ll remain outside the parietal peritoneum).      Anal Triangle  Objective      Define the Anal triangle of the Perineum and its contents.    The anal triangle lies posterior to the urogenital triangle, and is much simpler.  As mentioned before, this is on an oblique angle to the plane of the body.  It is effectively comprised of the external anal sphincter, surrounded by a fat-filled ischioanal fossa.  The ischioanal fossa is a fat-filled cavity that comprises the majority of the anal triangle.          At the bottom of the fossa is the levator ani muscle, which is part of the pelvic floor.      Along the lateral wall is the obturator internus.        More specifically, the ischioanal fossa has the following borders:          Laterally → obturator internus.      Superiorly → pelvic floor (levator ani).       Medially → the anal canal.      Anteriorly → Colle’s fascia (the fascia of the superficial pouch).        The pudendal nerves and canal hug the lateral wall of the ischianal fossa as well.  Clinical Note      The main complication of the anal triangle is an ischioanal abcess.    An ischioanal abcess can arise from an anal fissure which spreads into the ischioanal fossa.          When dealing with one, you must be careful of the pudendal nerves and vessels, since they travel along the lateral borders.      Must also be careful not to disrupt integrity of anal sphincter, puborectalis, and perineal body.        Objective      Define the contents of the rectal and anal canal.    The rectal canal opens into the anal canal; it becomes the anal canal at the level of the levator ani (shown in green below).  Surrounding the anal canal are sphincters → an internal anal sphincter, and an external anal sphincter.          The external anal sphincter is part of the anal triangle, and is comprised of skeletal muscle. It is under somatic control.      The internal anal sphincter is a thickening of the actual GI tube, hence it is comprised of smooth muscle. It is under autonomic control.        The anal canal is divided in two by the pectinate line (also called the dentate line).          This is important clinically because it demarcates where the GI tract ends, and the epithelium begins.      Hence, the histology, blood supply, and innervation changes at this point.        The chart below illustrates some of these changes:  Features Above/Below the Pectinate Line                    Supply/Features        Above Pectinate Line        Below Pectinate Line                            Embryological origin        Endoderm        Ectoderm                    Arterial        Superior rectal artery        Middle/inferior rectal arteries.                    Venous Drainage        Superior rectal vein        Middle/inferior rectal veins.                    Lymphatic Drainage        Internal iliac lymph nodes        Superficial inguinal lymph nodes                    Innervation        Autonomic        Somatic                    Histology        Simple columnar        Stratified squamous              Of particular note is the fact that anything above the pectinate line is autonomically innervated, and anything below the pectinate line is somatically innervated.          This makes sense → anything above the pectinate line is more like gut, and anything below it is more like skin.        Also, note that the superior rectal artery/vein supply the region superior to the pectinate line, and the middle/inferior rectal artery/vein supply the region inferior to the pecintate line.          This is important clinically because an internal hemorrhoid involves engorgement of the superior rectal veins, and an external hemorrhoid involves engorgement of the middle/inferior rectal veins.

Lecture Objectives  Locate the uterus, uterine tubes, ovaries and vagina and explain the anatomical basis for specific clinical conditions, eg ectopic pregnancy.  State the changes that occur in the position and size of the uterus during the life cycle and during pregnancy.  Given the structures that support and stabilize the uterus and vagina, propose possible complications if these structures are compromised.  discuss the “broad ligament” in terms of its components and the significance of structures found within the ligament folds.  On a diagram, outline the arterial supply, venous and lymphatic drainage and innervation of the reproductive organs.  Objective      Describe the structure, and location of the uterus, uterine tube, ovaries and vagina.    The uterus has 2 ligaments attached to it, which we saw were derived from the gubernaculum.          Round ligament of the uterus.      Ovarian ligament.        The uterine tubes are also referred to as the fallopian tubes, and they connect the uterus and the ovaries.          They don’t actually encapsulate the ovaries; rather, they have finger like projections called fimbriae that surround them.        The extension of the uterus into the vagina is called the cervix.  The uterus is sandwiched between the bladder anteriorly, and the rectum posteriorly.  Objective      Describe the position of the uterus with respect to cervix and vagina.    The position of the uterus varies between individuals.  To describe this, we characterize the uterus’ (1) flexion w.r.t. the vagina and (2) its flexion w.r.t. the cervix.          If the bladder is bent forward at the vagina towards the bladder, it is referred to as anteverted.      If the bladder is bent back at the vagina towards the rectum, it is referred to as retroverted.      If the bladder is bent forward at the cervix, it’s referred to as anteflexed.      If the bladder is bent backwards at the cervix, it’s referred to as retroflexed.        You can think of the ‘version’ as the tilt of the uterus, and the ‘flexion’ as the curving of the uterus.  The normal position of the uterus is anteverted, and anteflexed.  Why does this matter?          Digital exams, placement of IUDs, or pregnancies can be affected by the positioning of the uterus.        Remember      The most common position of the uterus is anteverted and anteflexed, so that it lies on top of the bladder.    Objective      Define the parts of the uterus, from a posterior view.    Below is a coronal view of the uterus, from its posterior aspect.  How can we tell that this is posterior, and not anterior?          The ovaries always project posteriorly, behind the broad ligament.        The uterus is categorized into 3 parts:          The upper part of the uterus is the fundus.      The middle part of the uterus is the body.      The lower part of the uterus is the cervix.        The wall of the uterus is also composed of 3 parts.          The lining is called endometrium.      The smooth muscle wall is called myometrium.      The outer part of the wall is called perimetrium, and it blends with the surrounding broad ligament.        The passageway between the uterus and the vagina has 2 mouths: an internal one, and an external one.          Hence, these are referred to as the internal os and the external os.      Between the two mouths lies the cervical canal.        Remember      The ovaries always project posteriorly with respect to the broad ligament.    Objective      State the changes that occur in the size and position of the uterus.    Prepuberty the ratio of uterine body:cervix is approximately 1:1.  After puberty, but before menopause, the body:cervix ratio becomes 2:1, to make more room for a potential child.  During pregnancy, the uterus gets extremely large → it pushes into the abdominal cavity, even as far as the xiphoid process! This can be seen to the right.  After menopause, the ratio returns to the prepubescent, 1:1 ratio.Here is what a uterus looks like in someone who is prepubertal or postmenopausal. Note that the cervix and body are approximately the same size.  Also, the external os changes in shape after a vaginal birth.          In women who have not had a vaginal birth before, their external os will be round.      In women who have had a vaginal birth, it will be more puckered and slit-like.        Changes in Uterine Size &amp; Features      Prepubescent women have a 1:1 body:cervix ratio.    Premenopausal women have a 2:1 body:cervix ratio.    Postmenopausal women have a 1:1 body:cervix ratio again.    A pregnant woman will (obviously) have a massive uterus.    Women who have had a vaginal birth will have a slit-like external os; women who have not will have a round external os.  On the left is the external os of a woman who has not had a vaginal birth; on the right is one who has had a vaginal birth. Note the rounded shape on the left, and the slit-like one on the right.  Objective      Describe the structures that support and stabilize the uterus &amp; vagina.    The uterus and vagina are supported by both muscle and ligaments.  Muscle:          This is the pelvic floor (aka. the pelvic diaphragm). It is the main dynamic support for the uterus.      Recall that this was comprised of:                  Levator ani.          Coccygeus muscles.                      Ligaments:          These arise from thickenings of the pelvic fascia.      These are mainly at the level of the vagina and cervix, in order to keep the uterus mobile. This helps during pregnancy.      There are 3 main ligaments:                  Uterosacral ligament (sacro-cervical), which projects posteriorly.		          Transverse cervical ligament (cardinal), which projects laterally.          Pubo-cervical ligament (anterior cervical), which projects anteriorly.                      Uterosacral Ligament          Also known as the sacro-cervical ligament.      This is shown in green below.      Note that it wraps around the uterus, and attaches to the sacrum; hence, ‘uterosacral’.      It functions as a sling for the uterus, and is an important landmark for the ureter.                  The ureter runs just lateral to the uterosacral ligament.                      Transverse Cervical Ligament          Also known as the cardinal ligament.      This is shown in red below.      This attaches to either side of the uterus, and extends laterally.      It functions to keep the uterus in a medial location, and is thought to give the most static support out of the 3 ligaments (hence, ‘cardinal’).        Pubocervical Ligament          Also known as the anterior cervical ligament.      This is smaller, and harder to see.      These ligaments attach anteriorly.        Remember      The main dynamic support for the uterus is the pelvic diaphragm (levator ani, coccygeus).    The main static support for the uterus are the transverse cervical ligaments (cardinal ligaments).    Weakening in either may result in a uterine prolapse or a cystocele.    When support from the pelvic diaphragm and ligaments is weakened:          You can have a uterine prolapse → the uterus could drop into the vaginal canal.      You can have a cystocele → the bladder could drop into the vaginal canal.        Objective      Describe parts and contents of the broad ligament.  Parts of the Broad Ligament  Broad ligament → a sheet of peritoneum that separates your reproductive organs from your intestinal structures.          Hence, it’s not a supportive structure, but rather a partition between repro and GI structures.        The broad ligament has 3 components:          Mesometrium → the part that’s attached to the uterus (hence -metrium).      Mesovarium → the part that’s attached to the ovary.  Note that -salpinx refers to a tube, typically the Fallopian or Eustacian tubes.      Mesosalpinx → the part that’s attached to the fallopian tube.        The meso- prefix suggests that these are mesenteries.          Recall that mesenteries were two joined layers of peritoneum.      This makes sense here → there’s peritoneum sandwiching both sides of the uterus, and where they stick together, you end up with mesentery.        The ovary isn’t encased in peritoneum:          Unlike the uterus, which is covered on both sides with peritoneum, the ovaries are stuck to the mesovarium.      Contents of the Broad Ligament  Since it’s a mesentery, many vessels travel within the broad ligament:          These include the uterine vessels and ureter.        The ligaments we discussed before (uterosacral, transverse cervical, pubocervical) are not part of the broad ligament.          As mentioned before, they’re thickenings of the pelvic fascia, and are hence inferior to the broad ligament.        The suspensory ligament is actually formed where the broad ligament draping over the ovarian artery and vein, as they approach the ovary.          Recall that the gonadal artery (ovarian/testicular) came off of the abdominal aorta (they were the boobs on the aorta man).      Hence, the suspensory ligament isn’t really a ligament, but rather a draping over the ovarian vessels.        Objective      Describe the location and structure of the Uterine Tubes and Ovaries.    The fallopian tube has the following parts:          Uterine → the part that merges with the uterus.      Isthmus → the long part.      Ampulla → where the tube begins to widen.      Infundibulum → the funnel shaped end of the ampulla.      Fimbriae → the finger like projections of the fallopian tube that surround the ovary.        Clinical Note      Hysterosalpingography can be done to make sure that the fallopian tubes are patent.    Hysterosalpingography → imaging of the uterus (hystero-) and fallopian tubes (salpingo-).  This involves injecting contrast through the vaginal canal, into the uterus.  Normally, the contrast should flow from the uterus through the fallopian tubes, and spill into the abdominal cavity.          Since the fimbriae and ovary are outside of the broad ligament, and are not directly connected to one another, there’s a gap between the two that communicates with the intraperitoneal space.      When the egg is released from the ovary, it travels across the small distance between the two, directed only by fluid flows created by the fimbriae.        If contrast does not flow all the way out, then there’s an obstruction.  Objective      Describe the location and structure of the Vagina (medial sagittal view).    The vagina is a thin-walled muscular tube sandwiched between the bladder and the rectum.  It passes through the urogenital diaphragm, which, as we’ll see tomorrow with Anatomy of the Perineum, is part of the deep perineal pouch.          The muscles in the urogenital diaphragm, namely the sphincter urethrae, help support and compress the vagina.        The upper end of the vagina envelops the bottom part of the uterus (the cervix).          Because the walls of the vagina then attach to the sides of the uterus, it creates these spaces on either side of the external os.      These are known as fornices, of which the posterior fornix is the largest space.        The posterior fornix is very thin walled.          This is important because the only thing separating the fornix from the abdominal cavity here is the vaginal wall and a thin layer of peritoneum.      Furthermore, the pouch that lies outside of the posterior fornix is the rectouterine pouch (more commonly known as the cul de sac, or the Pouch of Douglas).        Clinical Note      A culdocentesis can be done through the posterior fornix in order to remove material from the cul de sac.    Since the posterior fornix is so thin, it’s a convenient location to puncture in order to access the cul de sac.  It’s often used when there’s purulent fluid in the cul de sac.  This procedure is called a culdocentesis.  As we’ve mentioned before, we have a vesicouterine pouch formed by the space between the bladder and uterus, and a rectouterine pouch formed by the space between the uterus and rectum.  As mentioned above, the rectouterine pouch is often also called the Pouch of Douglas, or the cul de sac.  However, we also have another pouch defined by the space lateral to the uterus → this is the adnexal pouch.Recall that the suspensory ligament isn’t really a ‘ligament, but rather a draping over the ovarian vessels.  This space is important clinically since the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and suspensory ligaments lie there.  Clinical Note      Endometriosus is where endometrial tissue from the inner lining of the uterus implants itself outside of the uterus.    The most common place for this ectopic endometrial tissue to implant itself is in the Pouch of Douglas, along the uterosacral ligaments.  Since this tissue is endometrial, it’ll respond to the hormonal cycle → for instance, it’ll grow with estrogen.  It would also logically present in women that are still in their reproductive years.  These patients will often present with a dull crampy pain, and nausea, that won’t respond to painkillers.  When working a patient up for endometriosus, you have to r/o GI problems by asking for changes in bowel habits.  Objective      Follow the path of uterine, vaginal and ovarian artery.    As mentioned before, the ovarian arteries come off the aorta, get covered by the broad ligament to form the suspensory ligament, and then feed the ovary.  The ovarian artery will then anastamose with the uterine artery, which comes up from the internal iliac to supply the uterus and vagina.          Recall that the uterine artery travels within the broad ligament.      The vaginal artery can either be a branch off the uterine artery, or directly off the internal iliac.        Hence, there’s a dual supply of blood here.  As we saw in Genitourinary, both the ovarian and uterine arteries cross over the ureter:          Hence we referred to them as a ‘bridge over troubled water’ (the troubled water being the urine-containing ureter).      As we saw, this was a helpful feature for landmarking the ureter.        Remember      The ovarian artery comes down from the aorta.    The uterine artery comes up from the internal iliac.    The vaginal artery either (1) branches off of the uterine artery, or (2) comes directly off of the internal iliac.    Both the ovarian artery and the uterine artery cross over the ureter.    Objective      Name the venous drainage of the female reproductive organs.    Venous drainage is via plexuses.  The venous plexus around the bladder is the vesical plexus.  The venous plexuses around the uterus and vagina are called the uterine plexus and vaginal plexus respectively.  All of these plexuses will drain via either the internal iliac vein or the ovarian vein.          This is just like what we saw with the arterial supply → the arterial supply comes off of the aorta (via the ovarian artery) or the internal iliac (via the uterine/vaginal arteries).        Objective      Describe the innervation of the female reproductive organs.    Autonomic Innervation:          Sympathetic:                  This is via the inferior hypogastric plexus.          The nerves originate at L1-L2.          Provides vasomotor innervation to the uterine gland.                    Parasympathetic:                   This is via the pelvic splanchnics.          The nerves originate at S2,3,4.          Provides motor innervation to the vaginal smooth muscle.                      Somatic Innervation:          This is via the pudendal nerve, which provides somatic innervation to the lower vagina and perineum.        Summary of Innervation of the Female Reproductive System  Autonomic Innervation      Autonomic innervation (sympathetic or parasympathetic) is described below:                               Sympathetic        Parasympathetic                            Comes off of        Inferior Hypogastric Plexus        Pelvic Splanchnics                    Origin        L1-L2        S2,3,4                    Function        Vasomotor to uterine gland        Motor to smooth muscle of the vagina.              Somatic Innervation      The pudendal nerve provides somatic innervation to the lower vagina and perineum.    Pain fibres follow the Sympathetic/Parasympathetic Innervation:          Uterine pain goes back with the sympathetic nerves.      Vaginal/cervical pain goes back with the parasympathetic nerves.        This makes a lot of sense → the sympathetic nerves supply the uterus, so it makes sense that uterine pain travels with the sympathetics. Similarly, the parasympathetic nerves supply the vagina, so it makes sense that vaginal pain travels with the parasympathetics.  Example Application      Hyposthesia would be found in which of the following after a sacral nerve block?              Vaginal canal and perineum.        Uterine contractions.        Lower back.              Here, the answer is the vaginal canal and perineum:          This is because the vaginal canal and perineum are supplied by the parasympathetic nerves, which originate from S2,3,4.      Since the pain fibres follow the parasympathetics here, they’ll also go back to S2,3,4, where they’d be blocked by a sacral nerve block.        What if you wanted to block pain from uterine contractions?          Here, the uterine pain fibres follow the sympathetics, which originate in L1-L2.      Hence you’d need a lumbar block.        Note that the pudendal nerve branches off of the sacral plexus.          Hence, if you do a sacral block at the level of the sacral plexus, you end up blockage of the regions fed by both the somatic nerves (since this is from the pudendal), and the parasympathetic nerves.        In other words, we can have 3 different types of nerve blocks:          A pudendal block will block sensation to the somatic structures (the perineum, and upper vagina).      A sacral block will block sensation to both the somatic structures and the ones fed by parasympathetic nerves (ie. the subperitoneal contents).      A lumbar block will block sensation to the uterus (ie. the ‘intraperitoneal’ contents.)        Why is the uterus referred to as intraperitoneal when it’s outside of the peritoneum?          Technically the uterus is retroperitoneal, since it lies outside of the peritoneum lining the abdominal cavity.      However, since it projects into the abdominal cavity, OBGYNs refer to the uterus as intraperitoneal → this is a little confusing!        Nerve Blocks for the Female Reproductive System      A pudendal block will block sensation to the somatic structures.    A sacral block will block both sensation to the somatic structures (via the pudendal) and the subperitoneal structures.    A lumbar block will block sensation to the uterus (referred to as ‘intraperitoneal’).    The lymphatics follow the blood supply:          The ovaries and fallopian tubes get their blood supply from the ovarian artery, which comes off of the aorta. Hence, their lymphatic drainage is from the para-aortic nodes.      The uterus and vagina get their blood supply from the uterine and vaginal arteries, which come off of the internal iliac. Hence, their lymphatic drainage is from the internal iliac nodes (and the sacral nodes).

	{"title": "Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract", "text": "  Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract Notes      See Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract Notes.  Lecture Objectives  State the origin of the cells that contribute to the formation of the genital ridges.  Describe the formation of gonads, ducts and external genitalia from indifferent stages to definitive structures.  Describe the non-descent of ovaries and the anatomical basis for abnormal development of the female reproductive organs.The Urogenital Ridge  We’ll be looking at the urogenital ridge, which we saw previously with Embryology of the Kidney.  Associated with the urogenital ridge are 2 ducts:          Mesonephric Duct, aka. the Wolffian Duct.                  This develops into the male internal genitalia.          It also forms some of the glomeruli of the second kidney, the mesonephros.                    Paramesonephric Duct, aka. the Mullerian Duct.                  This develops into the female internal genitalia.                      Remember      The mesonephric duct is also known as the Wolffian Duct, and develops into the male internal genitalia.    The paramesonephric duct is also known as the Mullerian Duct, and develops into the female internal genitalia.    As seen before, the urogenital ridge is comprised of a medial ridge and a lateral ridge.          The medial ridge is the gonadal ridge → it forms the testes/ovaries.      The lateral ridge is the mesonephric ridge → the Wolffian and Mullerian ducts lie here, which become the rest of the male/female internal genitalia.        In other words, the gonadal ridge eventually forms the testis/ovary, and the mesonephric ridge will form everything else (the ducts and related organs).  Primitive sex cells migrate from the yolk sac via the dorsal mesentery, and form primitive sex cords at the gonadal ridge.          In the male, these become the seminiferous tubules.      In the female, these become the follicles.      Sexual Diferentiation  As we’ve seen before, differentiation into a male requires the presence of the SRY gene, which ultimately stimulates Sertoli cells to produce MIS, which inhibits Mullerian Duct development.          This means that the female reproductive structures develop passively → without any external stimulation, the Wolffian (mesonephric) duct will naturally regress, and the Mullerian (paramesonephric) duct will develop.        For a review of this, read Sex Determination &amp; Differentiation.Descent of the Ovaries  We saw before that there is a gubernaculum that attaches to the gonads (ovary/testes).  In the male, this drags the testes down into the scrotal sac.  Then why don’t the ovaries end up descending all the way in a female?          In the female, the uterus gets in the way.      As the gubernaculum is pulling the ovaries down, the uterus is also developing from the paramesonephric duct.       The uterus ends up getting in the way of the gubernaculum, and the gubernaculum ends up ‘sticking’ to it.      As a result, you end up with two vestigial ligaments:                  The ovarian ligament, which is the part of the gubernaculum that was from the ovary to the uterus.          The round ligament, which is the part of the gubernaculum that was from the uterus down to the labioscrotal region.                      Development of the Uterus:          The uterus arises from the merging of the left and right paramesonephric ducts.      The remaining unattached parts form the uterine tubes (the fallopian tubes).        Development of the Vagina:            The vagina is actually comprised of two embryological derivatives; the lower part of the paramesonephric ducts coming down, and a part of the urogenital sinus coming up.      At the bottom, where the vagina meets the vestibule, a perforated membrane forms, called the hymen.      Congenital Abnormalities of the Uterus  As mentioned before, the uterus is created by the merging of the paramesonephric ducts.  Congenital abnormalities of the uterus can then be viewed as a problem with this merging process.          If the two duct lumens fail to merge completely, you end up with a double uterus, or vagina.      If the lumens only merge at the bottom, you end up with a bicornuate uterus.      If the two ducts merge completely, but the lumens fail to merge, you end up with a septate uterus.      If one of the paramesonephric ducts fails to develop fully/at all, you can end up with a rudimentary horn or a unicornuate uterus, respectively.        This can be better seen below:Variations in the Hymen  Normally, the hymen doesn’t cover the entirety of the vaginal opening.  If it does, you end up with an imperforate hymen, which may cause amenorrhea (nothing can get out).  You can also have a very small opening (a microperforate hymen), or two openings (a septate hymen).Female Genital Development  As we saw in Genitourinary, both the male and female genitals arise from a common undifferentiated structure.  From this point, in the female:          The glans becomes the clitoris.      The labioscrotal swelling becomes the labia majora.      The urethral folds become the labia minora.      The urethral groove remains open, and becomes the vestibule.        In the male, the urethral groove zips up. As we saw in the past, anomalies in this can result in hypospadias.  Summary of Female Reproductive Tract Embryology      The primitive sex cords form the follicles in a female, and seminiferous tubules in a male.    In a female, the gubernaculum gets affixed to the uterus, forming the (1) ovarian ligament and the (2) round ligament of the uterus.    The paramesonephric ducts form the (1) fallopian tubes, (2) uterus, and (3) upper vagina.    The urogenital sinus forms the (1) urethra and (2) lower vagina.    The vagina is formed by the merging of the bottom of the paramesonephric ducts, and the top of the urogenital sinus.

Grade evidence &amp; make specific recommendations (Level A,B or C).        Assignment Topics:          Primary Cesarean Section — is it better than 24 hrs of labour?                  In other words, compare an elective cesarean section vs 24 hours of labour.                    Should Assisted Reproductive Technologies be offered to women over 50?      Should surgical intervention be offered to women at high risk for development of breast cancer?        There may not be a ‘right or wrong’ answer, you just have to review the literature and make a decision on what you think is best.
