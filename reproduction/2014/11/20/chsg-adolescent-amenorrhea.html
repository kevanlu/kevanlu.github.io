<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>What are the prerequisites for normal menstruation?
    <ul>
      <li>Hypothalamus</li>
      <li>Pituitary</li>
      <li>Gonads
        <ul>
          <li>Outflow: uterus, and a way out</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Adrenal</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are the endocrine events at puberty that normally lead to menstruation?
    <ul>
      <li>Start seeing changes in baseline characteristics at age 6-8
        <ul>
          <li>Adrenal corticotropins: DHEA and DHEAS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>HPG axis has been dormant since birth and is now activated (at age 8-9, before puberty starts)</li>
      <li>In early puberty, you get an increase in GnRH</li>
      <li>This causes an increase in LH which stimulates the ovary to grow in size and acquire function</li>
      <li>The ovaries produce sex hormones (mainly estrogen and a tiny bit of testosterone)</li>
      <li>This stimulates development of secondary sex characteristics</li>
      <li>Thelarche occurs around age 10, growth and pubarche</li>
      <li>Around 12 years of age, we approach menarche
        <ul>
          <li>Increased FSH and LH in a cyclical secretion results in estradiol and increased maturation and proliferation of the endometrium</li>
          <li>This will lead to an LH surge which causes ovulation</li>
          <li>Following this, you have progesterone release, and then a decrease in LH and FSH</li>
          <li>This is followed by menstruation, and then we go back to the beginning</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do adrenocortical hormones effect this cycle?
    <ul>
      <li>Normally secrete small amounts, but no phyiological effect</li>
      <li>If there is excessive secretion, can inhibit the HPG axis and suppress puberty</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How does stress affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the menstrual cycle?
    <ul>
      <li>By direct effect on GnRH, it can stop the entire cycle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="case-1-beth"><strong>Case 1: Beth</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beth is a 14 year old girl who comes to your family practice office because she has not yet started to menstruate. The other girls in her class tease her. Beth has generally been well and has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations. She has a good energy level and appetite. She is a B+ student and active in sports. Beth has not seen a physician in 4 years.</p>

  <p>You meet with Beth on her own. She looks well but appears younger than her chronologic age. She seems anxious and says that she would like to be a “little taller,” but she is mostly worried about why she has not had any breast development. “All my friends are developed, and I get teased in gym class when I undress. My mom said she got her period when she was 12.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beth’s past medical history is remarkable for recurrent otitis media as a child for which myringotomy tubes were placed at age 3 years. She was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy. Birth weight was 3.5 kg and her length was 50 cm. She met normal developmental milestones. She is taking no medications or vitamins.</p>

  <p>Her mother’s height is 157 cm and the father’s height 175 cm.</p>

  <p>On physical exam, she is young-appearing and healthy.</p>

  <p>VS: BP 100/64, Pulse 76 (should also have RR, temperature and O2 sat)
Weight is 35 kg
Height 137 cm
Tanner I (breast and pubic hair)</p>

  <li>What is Beth’s expected adult height based on parental height?
    <ul>
      <li>Expected adult height 159.5 cm
        <ul>
          <li>That is the 25th percentile and she is way below the 3rd</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Short stature, pubertal delay, primary amenorrhea</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Should you perform a pelvic examination?
    <ul>
      <li>No: because she has no pubertal development whatsoever, so the cause is unlikely to be localized to the uterus in a way you can detect via physical exam
        <ul>
          <li>It is also painful and highly invasive for a young girl to go through</li>

  <li>Why must pregnancy be considered in girls with primary amenorrhea?
    <ul>
      <li>Because they can ovulate before they have menstruation</li>
      <li>50% of adolescents do not use protection during first sexual intercourse (and they don’t always disclose this)</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are the characteristics of this disorder? Why might Beth not have all the characteristic features?
    <ul>
      <li>Because she is a mosaic (some normal cells and some abnormal)</li>
      <li>Webbed neck, widely spaced nipples, increased carrying angle</li>
      <li>Horseshoe kidney</li>

      <li>Estrogen and growth hormone
        <ul>
          <li>Growth hormone first to achieve maximum growth potential and then estrogen to push on with puberty (estrogen will fuse the growth plates so you can’t overlap the two)</li>

Ginny states that she had intercourse on one or two occasions with a 17 year old peer. She denies that she had ever been coerced to have sex. She has not used birth control.</p>

  <p>You review Ginny’s medical record. She has had regular pediatric care. Her mother and father were 20 and 21 years old respectively when she was born. Her birth history and infancy are unremarkable. Her parents divorced when she was 3, and her mother remarried when she was 5. She has 3 siblings, and her 16 year old sister has a 1 year old child. Ginny had psychotherapy for several months at age 9 because of anger and “difficult behavior” at home. Her mother has had problems with alcohol abuse and marital discord. Ginny’s relationship with her step-father is described as “strained.” Ginny’s mother had admitted on a previous visit that both she and her husband occasionally became outraged with Ginny’s sullen, uncooperative behavior and had resorted to physical punishment.</p>

<h2 id="case-3-felisha"><strong>Case 3: Felisha</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Felisha is a 16 year old girl who is coming to see you with her mother, because they are concerned that she has not had her period yet. Her mother says that both she and her sister were late to get their periods, but thinks that she got her first period at age 15. All of her friends at her boarding school have had their periods for a couple of years already. Felicia has recently started lying to her friends and pretending to have started menstruating because of her embarrassment.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>How would you characterize Felisha’s problem?
    <ul>
      <li>Primary amenorrhea</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Felisha has generally been well. She has had no major illnesses, hospitalizations or surgery. There are no symptoms of fatigue, headache, nausea, weight loss or other systemic symptoms. Felisha is on no medications. She is described as having a healthy appetite. Felisha is in grade 10 at her local high school and is a B student. She plays house-league soccer and is on the school swim team.</p>

  <p>Upon examination:</p>

  <p>Vital Signs – HR: 80, BP: 120/78, RR: 20 Temp 37 C
Height is 162 cm and weight is 51 kg</p>

  <p>Breast development includes projection of the areola above the level of the breast to form a secondary mound. Pubic hair is coarse and covers most but not all of the labia majora and pubis. The external genitalia are normal female. There is mild acne over the forehead and cheeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty normal: 50th percentile for height, between the 25th and 50th for weight</p>

<ol>
  <li>What Tanner stage is Felisha? Is there delayed development of secondary sexual characteristics?
    <ul>
      <li>We know she has estrogen and testosterone around</li>
      <li>We see the secondary mound around Tanner stage IV, along with pubic hair around labia majora and monis, so she seems to be on a normal track</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What tests would you order and why?
    <ul>
      <li>TSH</li>
      <li>Prolactin</li>
      <li>LH/FSH
        <ul>
          <li>If they are high, it indicates ovarian failure (not dysgenesis, because she did develop breasts)</li>
          <li>If they are low, it is central and could be due to stress, anorexia, constitutional delay</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Pelvic U/s for outflow tract obstruction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the most likely cause of Felisha’s delayed menstruation?
    <ul>
      <li>Constitutional delay</li>
      <li>Watch and wait! Send her off and follow-up in 6 months
        <ul>
          <li>And reassure her that this is normal and it will come soon</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What aspects of the history and physical are most reassuring in making this diagnosis?</li>
  <li>When Felisha returns for follow up the following year, what do you expect to find?
    <ul>
      <li>Menses has occurred</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is a progesterone challenge?
    <ul>
      <li>Give progestin over 5 days, and withdraw it and if there is estrogen present, they should have menses in a week</li>
      <li>A failure of the challenge could indicate Asherman’s syndrome or they are profoundly hypoestrogenic (e.g. anorexia nervosa)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When would this be indicated?
    <ul>
      <li>If she doesn’t develop her period when she comes back in, in 6 months</li>
      <li>In general, you would use this when
        <ul>
          <li>They have gone into puberty</li>
          <li>R/O
            <ul>
              <li>Pregnancy</li>
              <li>Hypothryoidism or abnormal prolactin</li>
              <li>Outflow tract obstruction (ability to bleed)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How would your management change if Felisha’s weight was 39 kg?
    <ul>
      <li>Investigate why she has a low weight</li>
      <li>This qualifies as a stress which would interrupt the axis
        <ul>
          <li>In anorexia nervosa, there is some evidence for a primary hypothalamic problem</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why do you think delayed menarche was a concern to Felisha?
    <ul>
      <li>Social pressure</li>
      <li>Parental pressure</li>
      <li>Might have thought she could have been pregnant (especially if she hasn’t received sexual education)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
