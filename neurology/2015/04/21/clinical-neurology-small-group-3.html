<hr />

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="case-summary"><strong>Case Summary</strong></h4>
  <p>A 37 year old woman presents to the urgent neurology clinic with a referral question of “foot drop”. Two weeks ago, she noticed on awakening that she was dragging her right leg when walking and she had come close to falling on a couple of occasions. She has felt a tight sensation around her right flank around the same time. The symptoms came on overnight and have not worsened nor improved over time. She has noticed some urinary frequency and urgency since the leg symptoms began.</p>

  <p>Two years ago, she had an episode of monocular vision loss in her left eye which lasted 3 weeks. She was seen by an ophthalmologist at that time who diagnosed her with optic neuritis. Her vision improved and she had not had a recurrence.</p>

  <p>Past Medical History: otherwise healthy. Meds: none. Family Hx: non-contributory. Systemic review of symptoms was unremarkable.</p>

  <p>On examination, she was noted to have a mildly pale left optic disc on fundoscopy. Cranial nerves were otherwise normal with no evidence of a RAPD. Upper extremity power was full. Left leg power was full. On the right side, her hip flexion was 4+, knee extension 5, knee flexion 4+, ankle dorsiflexion 4, ankle plantar flexion 5, foot inversion 5, and foot eversion 4. Upper extremity reflexes were 2s throughout. Patellar reflexes were 3 on the right and 2 on the left. Ankle reflexes were 4 on the right and 2 on the left. Plantar response was extensor on the right and flexor on the left. Pin prick was slightly reduced over the left leg, with a sensory level of approximately T8. Upper extremity coordination testing was unremarkable. Lower extremity coordination testing revealed difficulties related to the weakness, but there was no obvious superimposed ataxia.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="questions"><strong>Questions</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li><em>Localize her most recent symptoms of leg weakness.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Possible localizations include:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Upper motor neuron</em> → brain, brainstem, spinal cord.</li>
          <li><em>Lower motor neuron</em> → AHC, root, plexus, peripheral nerve, NMJ, muscle.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Patient has pyramidal weakness (extensors &gt; flexors in leg) on the R side.</li>
      <li>Also has hyperreflexia and a positive Babinsky on the R side.</li>
      <li>The above suggest an UMN problem (brain, brainstem, or spinal cord).</li>
      <li>Although the urinary frequency and urgency might be suggestive of cauda equina, cauda equina is a LMN finding, which isn’t compatible with the above UMN signs.</li>
      <li>Reduction in pinprick sensation over the contralateral leg suggests that this a spinal cord issue, since the spinothalamic tract crosses right when it enters the spinal cord.</li>
      <li>Hence, with the above, this is a <strong>R spinal cord</strong> problem, most likely at T8 given the sensory level.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the most likely clinical diagnosis? Are other diagnoses possible? How would you confirm this diagnosis?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multiple Sclerosis</strong> is most likely, since she seems to have had multiple focal CNS lesions over time and space.
        <ul>
          <li>Optic nerve lesion 2 years ago.</li>
          <li>R thoracic spinal cord lesion now.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Confirmation</em> → Imaging (MRI brain + spinal cord).</li>
      <li>Optic neuritis at a young age is suspicious for MS (recall that CN II is part of the CNS, and not PNS).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the underlying pathophysiology of MS? How can this be directly related to the symptoms with which the disease presents?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Caused by a T-cell mediated inflammatory process that results in demyelination.</li>
      <li>Focal regions of demyelination, followed by recovery, results in the multiple focal lesions.</li>
      <li>Axon damage due to these inflammatory effects results in progression long-term.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Discuss the clinical relevance of:</em>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>LHermitte’s sign</strong> → neck flexion causes an ‘electrical sensation’ that goes down the back. 
        <ul>
          <li>This causes pulling along the dorsal column or caudal medulla.</li>
          <li>With a demyelinating lesion, it’s thought that electrical communication is disrupted, resulting in abnormal electrical signalling.</li>
          <li><i>Not specific to MS</i>; any obstruction of the dorsal column or problem with myelination can cause it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Uhthoff’s sign</strong> → exacerbation of neurological findings due to hot weather, fever, or exercise.
        <ul>
          <li>Seen in MS, it’s thought that this is due to an exacerbation of already impaired nerve conduction with an increase in heat.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Relative afferent pupillary defect</strong> → an impairment in the afferent signal from one eye relative to the other.
        <ul>
          <li>Assessed by the <i>Swinging flashlight test</i>, where you would see paradoxical dilation with direct light (since the eye ‘sees’ less light via the direct reflex compared to via the consensual reflex).</li>
          <li>Could be suggestive of optic neuritis, which could corroborate a diagnosis of MS.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>What are the diagnostic criteria for MS? Can MS be diagnosed clinically or is imaging necessary?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MS is a diagnosis of exclusion.</strong></li>
      <li>Any corroborative symptoms must last for more than 24 hours.</li>
      <li>MS can theoretically be diagnosed clinically, if there’s strong evidence of lesions separated in space and time as shown above.</li>
      <li>However, imaging should still be done as it helps confirm the burden of disease, and help rule out mimics such as other anatomic causes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Discuss the natural history of MS – what is the prognosis for a newly diagnosed patient?</em>
 <img class="med-right" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4sm4d57annqq50o/uvu33t22.png" />
    <ul>
      <li>Recall that MS can either be <em>Relapsing Remitting</em>, or <em>Progressive</em> (primary or secondary).</li>
      <li>Most patients have the relapsing remitting form, where the disease will intermittently get better and worse, with a variable degree of recovery.</li>
      <li>Eventually relapsing remitting MS will progress to a secondary progressive MS, where there is gradual progression even between relapses.</li>
      <li>However, a specific prognosis is difficult to make, since <i>every patient has a different clinical course.</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="case-summary-1"><strong>Case Summary</strong></h4>
  <p>Bharati is a 57 year old physician who has had headaches for over 30 years and you are the clinical clerk seeing her in her family physician’s office.</p>

  <p>Her typical headache is a bilateral, throbbing head pain that is most pronounced posteriorly. The headache builds to maximum severity over 1‐2 hours and is treated with ibuprofen 600 mg; the headache usually resolves within 3‐4 hours of taking the ibuprofen. These headaches occur without warning and are associated with mild light sensitivity, nausea and neck stiffness. The headache increases in intensity when she climbs the stairs at work. Thirty years ago, the headaches occurred more than 10 days a month and were particularly severe just before menses. She was started on atenolol 50 mg once daily and increased to 50 mg twice daily after 2 weeks. With this, her headaches were reduced to a mild headache once a month two or three days before her menstrual cycle. Triggers such as sleep deprivation, stress and skipping meals will trigger headaches that are readily relieved by taking almotriptan 12.5 mg.</p>

  <p>Family history is positive for headache in her mother and her son. She is otherwise healthy, does not smoke and drinks 1‐2 glasses of wine per week.</p>

  <p>In the past 3 months, she has been bothered by increasing headaches, originally once per week but now occurring 4‐5 days per week. These headaches are also located posteriorly, accompanied by a feeling of neck stiffness and mild nausea. They are present in the morning on awakening, and then get better after she gets up and around but is taking longer to resolve this past week. The headaches do not interfere with sleep. Over the same period she has noticed increasing difficulty with reading, and wondering whether her bifocal prescription needs adjusting has scheduled an appointment with her optometrist in the next week. She has been otherwise well without fevers, myalgias or weight loss.</p>

  <p>On examination, her blood pressure was 130/70 in the right arm seated. Pulse was 66 beats per minute regular. No tenderness or nodularity with palpation of the superficial temporal arteries. No signs of meningeal irritation. Her chest was clear and heart sounds were normal.</p>

  <p>On neurological examination, she appeared well and was fluent and articulate. Her pupils were equal and briskly reactive on direct and consensual testing to light. With the swinging flashlight test, the left eye dilated 2 mm upon swinging the flashlight from the right eye to the left. VA corrected revealed 20/20 OD and 20/70 OS. Visual fields were full to confrontation. You didn’t see the optic discs well and planned to ask your preceptor to check this. Otherwise, eye movements were full with no nystagmus and symmetric facial movement. Bedside hearing was normal. Sensation to pinprick and vibration in the arms and legs was normal. Bulk, tone and power were normal. Deep tendon reflexes were 3+ symmetrical and down‐going toes bilaterally. Normal coordination and gait.</p>

<h2 id="questions-1"><strong>Questions</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li><em>What is the diagnosis for her typical headaches? How did you make this diagnosis?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Migraine without aura</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Corroborative Features</em> → throbbing, unilateral, nausea or vomiting, worse with activity, photophobia and phonophobia.</li>
          <li>Also found to have a family history, and headaches are associated with triggers (hormonal changes).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Since she doesn’t have a preceding aura (visual changes), this isn’t a <i>Migraine with aura</i>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What features of her most recent headaches are relevant and why? Why is this not giant cell arteritis?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Recent changes in the nature of headaches:</i>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased frequency, recent onset, progressive.</li>
          <li>Worsening pattern of headache.</li>
          <li>This suggests that this is a new problem versus her pre-existing problem.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><i>Findings on examination:</i>
        <ul>
          <li>L RAPD is present, suggests impaired afferent signal in L eye.</li>
          <li>Impaired visual acuity in the L eye corroborates this.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This is NOT giant cell arteritis because:
        <ol>
          <li>There’s no tenderness over the superficial temporal arteries.</li>
          <li>Different pain presentation (GCA has a ‘boring, aching pain’).</li>
          <li>No associated symptoms (fever, malaise, night sweats, weight loss).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What does the “swinging flashlight” test assess? What info does this give you?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Described in the previous case.</li>
      <li>Here, it suggests an afferent defect in the L eye.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Her visual fields to confrontation were normal. Do you need to do anything else? What would you expect to find if there was a problem anterior to the optic chiasm? Posterior to the optic chiasm?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Visual field testing via confrontation is fairly non-specific; referral to ophthalmology for formal field assessment is idea.</li>
      <li>Lesions anterior to the optic chiasm → <em>monocular deficits.</em></li>
      <li>Lesions of the crossing fibres of the optic chiasm → <em>bitemporal hemianopsia.</em></li>
      <li>Lesions posterior to the optic chiasm → <em>homonymous hemianopsia.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What investigations would you order? Be specific – what are you looking for and when do you want this/these test(s) done?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>MRI of optic nerve and orbit.</li>
      <li>Referral to ophthalmology.</li>
      <li>Depending on imaging, referral to Neurosurgery may be indicated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="history-of-present-illness"><strong>History of Present Illness</strong></h4>
  <p>Mary is a 49 year old woman referred to the Neurology Clinic for involuntary movements. She was accompanied by Sudeep, her husband of 20 years. Over the past 6 to 9 months, Sudeep has noticed that Mary has become increasingly fidgety. He points out to you the jerking movements of her hands and also tells you she her walking has changed. Mary has a lengthy history of depression and anxiety that has prevented her from working fulltime for over 10 years. Her psychiatrist had noticed the movements and had discussed referral for neurology consultation with her family physician.</p>

  <p>Past medical history is significant for depression and anxiety with one hospitalization 3 years ago for suicidal ideation. She is currently taking venlafaxine extended release 150 mg/d. She has been on a number of other anti-depressant medications in the past but did not have a list with her. NKDA She is a non-smoker, drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week and does not use street drugs.</p>

  <p>Family History: Mary’s mother is 76-years-old with a history of migraines, hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. There is cardiovascular disease on the maternal side. Her father committed suicide at age 32. He had not been close to his family although Mary thinks that there may be a history of depression in his family. She has 2 healthy, maternal half-siblings. Mary and Sudeep have 2 healthy children, age 17 and 21.</p>

  <h4 id="examination"><strong>Examination</strong></h4>
  <p>Mary is slightly disheveled with a flat affect. She appeared restless and fidgety during the interview. She scored 29/30 on the MMSE (she has a university degree) losing one point for spelling WORLD backwards (DLOW). Her speech was fluent without dysarthria. She had involuntary, rapid, irregular jerking movements of the hands with unusual posturing movements of her trunk. There was no predictable pattern to the movements, although they often ended in adjustments of her eye glasses or her clothing. Her feet were also restless, but to a lesser degree. Cranial nerve examination was normal; although she had trouble sticking her tongue out (would protrude but not keep it out). Motor examination revealed normal bulk and power. Sensory examination was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+, symmetrical with flexor plantar responses. Her gait was very unusual with staggering with accentuation of the abnormal hand and finger movements.</p>

<h2 id="questions-2"><strong>Questions</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li><em>What is the word used to describe the involuntary movements of this patient (also shown in the video)?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chorea</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Broadly classify involuntary movements and list 2 other types of abnormal involuntary movements.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hyperkinetic</strong> → increased movement.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Choreiform</em> → irregular jerky movements.</li>
          <li><em>Athetosis</em> → twisting and writhing movements, often associated with choreiform movements (‘choreoathetoid’)</li>
          <li><em>Tremors</em> → physiological, action tremors, resting tremors, intention tremors. Characterized by regular and rhythmic movement.</li>
          <li><em>Myoclonus</em> → brief involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles (like those jerks you make when you’re falling asleep).</li>
          <li><em>Dystonia</em> → <i>sustained</i>, abnormal muscle contraction.</li>
          <li><em>Tic</em> → <i>stereotyped</i> muscle contraction.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Hypokinetic</strong> → decreased movement.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Akinesia</em> → inability to initiate movement.</li>
          <li><em>Bradykinesia</em> → slowness of movement.</li>
          <li><em>Dysarthria</em> → difficulty in speech production.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>List 4 causes of chorea.</em>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Drugs</em> → eg. Levodopa.</li>
      <li><em>Huntington’s Disease</em>.</li>
      <li>Benign Familial Chorea.</li>
      <li>Hyperthyroidism.</li>
      <li>Lupus (it could always be Lupus!)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? How would you verify this?</em> 
 <img class="med-right" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4sm4d57annqq50o/kd11dt56.png" />
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Huntington’s Disease</strong>, since Huntington’s classically presents with (1) motor, (2) psychiatric, and (3) cognitive issues. This patient has some evidence of all 3.</li>
      <li>The age of onset also agrees, and she isn’t on any drugs that could potentially cause the choreiform symptoms.</li>
      <li>Huntington’s affects the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen); you can actually see gross atrophy on imaging or pathology (see right).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the relevance of Mary’s psychiatric history?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>As mentioned above, psychiatric findings corroborate a diagnosis of Huntington’s.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the risk, if any, to Mary’s children? Is there a role for predictive testing?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>They do have a significant risk, especially due to <i>anticipation</i>.</li>
      <li>Since the children are of an age where they can make their own decisions, testing should be up to them.</li>
      <li>Since Huntington’s has no cure, predictive testing likely will not change clinical decision making, especially while they’re still asymptomatic.</li>
      <li>The overwhelming majority of people actually choose not to be tested.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Define anticipation as it relates to this case.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Anticipation</em> → where the onset of a disease begin earlier and earlier with successive generations.</li>
      <li>Seen with trinucleotide repeat disorders, where the repeated area expands with subsequent generations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
