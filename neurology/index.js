Compare the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways of the basal ganglia.  Know the major subdivisions of the thalamus, their main connections and primary function.  Describe the location and major functions of the hypothalamus and epithalamus.Review of the Cerebrum  Components of the Cerebrum:          Cerebral Cortex (Gray Matter)                  Superficial cortical layer of gray matter containing neuronal cell bodies                    Cerebral White Matter                  Deeper layer of white matter containing fibers connecting cell bodies to other cortical areas and the rest of the brain                    Deep Gray Matter                  Comprises the basal ganglia; the deepest layer of large collections of neuronal cell bodies.                    Basal Ganglia  Basal Ganglia → deep layer of neuronal cell bodies located in the cerebrum (deep gray matter).          Shown in pink on the right.      Note that this is c-shaped; as we discussed in Anatomy of the Cerebrum, the cerebrum develops embryologically as a c-shape.      Since the basal ganglia is part of the cerebrum, it follows this shape as well.      In coronal sections, since the caudate nucleus sort of loops around a bit, you can often see it represented twice.        Objective      Identify the main structures that comprise the basal ganglia.    Anatomically, it consists of the following:            Caudate nucleus.      Putamen.      Globus pallidus.      Amygdala.        Lentiform nucleus → refers to the putamen + globus pallidus.  Thalamus → just medial to the lentiform nucleus.  Caudate nucleus → has 3 parts: (1) Head, (2) Body, (3) Tail.  Amygdala → Although many anatomical texts refer to the amygdala as a separate structure, anatomically it should be considered part of the basal ganglia.          As can be seen on the right, this is a round structure on the tail of the caudate nucleus. (recall that cauda = tail).      The amygdala is part of the limbic system, which governs our emotions.        Functions of the Basal Ganglia:          Motor → coordinate speed and strength of movements.      Cognition, learning, emotions.        Today, we’ll be focusing primarily on the motor function of the basal ganglia.          This is what’s most applicable clinically; dysfunctions in the basal ganglia lead to movement disorders.      Anatomic Location of the Basal Ganglia  Below are coronal and transverse (horizontal) cross-sections of the brain.  Note that the insular cortex can easily be seen here as the gray matter that is covered by the parietal and temporal lobes.  Below is an coronal section at an anterior location on the basal ganglia.  Note that we don’t see the thalamus here:          This is because the thalamus is posteromedial relative to the lentiform nucleus, so it’s posterior to the level at which the cross section was taken (see right).        Note the anatomy of the lentiform nucleus:          The Putamen is more lateral.      The Globus pallidus is more medial.        Below is a transverse (horizontal) section through the basal ganglia.          Here, you can actually see the head of the caudate nucleus, and where it attaches to the lentiform nucleus.      You don’t see the body of the caudate because it’s superior to the level of the cross section.      But you do see the tail as the ‘C’ curves back into the plane.      You can also see the thalamus more medially (the unlabelled midline gray matter).        Note that the globus pallidus has 2 parts, which are involved in different motor control pathways.:          External      Internal        Anatomic Components of the Basal Ganglia      Basal Ganglia → putamen + globus pallidus + caudate nucleus + amygdala.    Lentiform Nucleus → globus pallidus + putamen.    Striatum → putamen + caudate nucleus.    Lentiform nucleus is comprised of 2 more functionally dissimilar parts (putamen and globus pallidus).    Striatum is comprised of 2 more functionally similar parts (putamen + caudate nucleus).

State the origin and intracranial location of the middle meningeal artery and its significance in intracranial hemorrhage.Cranial Nerves  Objective      Name the cranial nerves, state where they originate in the CNS, outline their intracranial course, state where they exit from the cranial cavity and give their main functions.    12 (Pairs) of Cranial Nerves.  (VERY DIRTY) Mnemonic: Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, To Touch And Feel (a) Virgin Girl’s Vagina And Hymen.            O → Olfactory (CN I).      O → Optic (CN II).      O → Oculomotor (CN III).      T → Trochlear (CN IV).      T → Trigeminal (CN V).      A → Abducens (CN VI).      F → Facial (CN VII).      V → Vestibulocochlear (CN VIII).      G → Glossopharyngeal (CN IX).      V → Vagus (CN X).      A → (Spinal) Accessory Nerve (CN XI).      H → Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII).        Of these, 4 nerves carry parasympathetic innervation:          III → Oculomotor.      VII → Facial.      IX → Glossopharyngeal.      X → Vagus.        Some of these nerves play a role in our senses:          Olfactory Nerve (CN I) → smell.      Optic Nerve (CN II) → sight.      Facial &amp; Glossopharyngeal (CN VII, IX) → taste.      Vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) → hearing &amp; balance.      Functions of the Cranial Nerve  Unlike with the spinal nerves roots, where the dorsal roots are all sensory, and the ventral roots are all motor, the cranial nerves are a hodgepodge of motor and sensory innervation.  To remember these, use the following mnemonic:          Some Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Big Brains Matter Most.      Or, if you’re of the dirtier persuasion, you could use Big Breasts.        S → Sensory (smell).  S → Sensory (vision).  M → Motor (+ parasympathetic).  M → Motor.  B → Both.  M → Motor.  B → Both (taste + parasympathetic too).  S → Sensory (hearing and balance).  B → Both (taste + parasympathetic too).  B → Both (+ parasympathetic).  M → Motor.  M → Motor.Origins of the Cranial Nerve  Generally the lower numbers exit the brain more anteriorly, and the higher numbers exit the brain more posteriorly.          The exception is the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII); it actually exits anteriorly to XI.        Origins of the Cranial Nerves:          CN I → Olfactory bulb      CN II → Optic tract      CN III &amp; IV → Midbrain      CN V → Pons      CN VI-VIII → Pons/Medulla      CN IX, X &amp; XII → Medulla      CN XI → Spinal cord        CN V comes off exclusively from the pons; VI-VIII come off and the junction between the pons and medulla.Exits of the Cranial Nerves  I → Cribriform Plate.  II → Optic Canal.  III, IV, V1, VI → Superior Orbital Fissure.          This is easy to remember; all the nerves that move the eye, plus the branch of the trigeminal that provides sensory information near there.        V2 → Foramen rotundum.  V3 → Foramen ovale.  VII, VIII → Internal Acoustic Meatus.  IX, X, XI → Jugular Foramen.          Recall that the sigmoid sinus also runs through here, to become the internal jugular vein.        XII → Hypoglossal Canal.Summary of the Cranial NervesSensory Innervation of the Dura Mater  Objective      Outline the sensory nerve supply of the dura mater.    The dura mater has sensation, largely through the CN V (trigeminal).  Recall that the trigeminal nerve has 3 branches:          Ophthalmic (V1) → to the eye region.      Maxillary (V2) → to the maxilla.      Mandibular (V3) → to the mandible.        Their innervation of the dura mater however, is more complicated.          V1 → antero-medial dura, but also sneaks to the back of the head to innervate most of the cerebellar tentorium.      V2 → over where the maxilla would be.      V3 → near where the foramen ovale is (where the mandibular leaves).      Cervical Spinal Nerves → mainly from C2, C3, innervates the dura over the posterior fossa.      Arterial Supply of the Cranial Cavity  Objective      Describe the intracranial course of the main arteries supplying the brain, name their main branches and state their areas of supply.    There are 4 arteries (2 pairs) that supply the brain itself:          Anteriorly, 2 x Internal Carotid Artery, branching off the common carotids.      Posteriorly, 2 x Vertebral Artery, branching off the subclavians.        As we saw in MSK, the vertebral arteries go through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae, and enter the foramen magnum.  In addition, there is another pair of arteries that enters the skull, but doesn’t enter the brain:          2 x middle meningeal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, which is a branch off the external carotid.      The middle meningeal tracks along the inner surface of the skull, and supplies the meninges with blood.      Note that the middle meningeal runs near the thin pterion! This will be important later on.        Recall from ENT the branches of the external carotid:          Superior Thyroid.      Ascending Pharyngeal.      Lingual.      Facial.      Occipital.      Posterior Auricular.      Maxillary.      Superficial Temporal.        Mnemonic → Some Anatomists Like Freaking Out Poor Medical Students.          Of these, the middle meningeal comes off of the maxillary artery.        Arteries of the Cranial Cavity      4 vessels supply the brain:              2 x Internal Carotid Artery, coming off the common carotids.        2 x Vertebral Artery, coming off the subclavians.              2 other vessels enters the skull, but don’t supply the brain:              2 x Middle Meningeal Artery.            Foramina for the Cranial Vessels  The foramina through which the key vessels of the skull pass through are:          Carotid Canal → Internal Carotid Arteries.      Jugular Foramen → Internal Jugular Veins      Foramen Magnum → Vertebral Arteries.      Foramen Spinosum → Middle Meningeal Arteries.        The foramen spinosum is a tiny hole that’s lateral to the foramen ovale (which was where V3 went through).  What else goes through the jugular foramen?          Recall that the sigmoid sinus enters the jugular foramen, to become the IJV.      In addition to this, we also mentioned that cranial nerves IX, X, XI also go through the jugular foramen.        Correction → the original slide said that the internal carotid goes through the foramen lacerum. This is incorrect; it actually goes through the carotid canal (as mentioned above).          Although the foramen lacerum is close to the carotid canal, nothing actually goes through it, because in living people, it’s actually covered in cartilate.        Foramina for the Cranial Vessels      Carotid Canal → Internal Carotid Arteries.    Jugular Foramen → Internal Jugular Veins    Foramen Magnum → Vertebral Arteries.    Foramen Spinosum → Middle Meningeal Arteries.  The Circle of Willis  Objective      Define the term “Circle of Willis” and state its functional significance.    Circle of Willis → a circle of blood vessels formed between the 4 major arteries that feed the brain.          Slick setup; by having anastamoses between the cerebral arteries, there is collateral circulation if any of the 4 arteries are affected.      Good at compensating for the gradual occlusion of one vessel (eg. plaque accumulation), but insufficient for compensating for sudden changes (eg. a burst aneurysm).      Location → runs around the pituitary stalk and optic chiasm (very small). Above the cavernous sinus.        Anatomy of the Circle of Willis:          Posteriorly, the L &amp; R vertebrals combine to form the basilar artery.      This then splits to form 2 x posterior cerebral arteries.      Anteriorly, the L &amp; R internal carotids give off anterior cerebral arteries.      The posterior cerebral arteries connect to the ICAs via the posterior communicating branches.      The two anterior cerebral arteries connect via a single anterior communicating branch.      After the ICAs give off the anterior cerebrals, they continue as the middle cerebral arteries.        THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIES ARE NOT PART OF THE CIRCLE OF WILLIS.          See the figure; the middle cerebral arteries are not part of the circle itself.        Objective      Outline the distribution of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries to the cerebral cortex.    You can figure out the distribution of the cerebral arteries based on how they exit the Circle of Willis:          The anterior cerebral arteries exit straight out, so they supply the midline.      The middle cerebral arteries exit to the sides, so they supply the lateral brain.      The posterior cerebral arteries reflect backwards, so they supply the posterior and inferior brain.        Note that the middle cerebral arteries are considered the terminal branches of the internal carotid arteries, and the posterior cerebral arteries are the terminal branches of the basilar artery.Cranial Hematomas  Cranial hematomas can be classified into 3 groups, depending on where the blood leakage occurs:          Epidural Hematoma.      Subdural Hematoma.      Subarachnoid Hematoma.        Because the structures in each compartment difer, the causes of each differ as well.1. Epidural Hematoma  Objective      State the origin and intracranial location of the middle meningeal artery and its significance in intracranial hemorrhage.    Epidural Hematoma → blood in the epidural space (between the dura mater and the skull).  Cause → Typically due to a fracture at the pterion, which tears the middle meningeal artery.          Recall that the pterion was the thinnest part of the skull, and that it’s nearby the path of the middle meningeal.      This causes filling of the potential space between the dura and skull.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          The classic presentation is that the person passes out, but then come-to and seem normal (lucid interval).      Gradual compression of the brain then results in coma.      Without relief of the pressure, the central structures of the brain will try and herniate through the foramen magnum.      This compresses the structures that control your breathing, which can lead to respiratory failure.      2. Subdural Hematoma  LESS COMMON THAN A SUBARACHNOID OR EPIDURAL HEMATOMA.  Subdural Hematoma → blood in the subdural space (between the arachnoid and dura mater).  Cause → Sudden acceleration-deceleration of the brain parenchyma.          Results in tearing of the reflections of the meningeal layers of the dura mater.      This can also tear the bridging veins, which transmit blood from the cerebral veins in the subarachnoid space up to the venous sinuses (which lie between the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura).      This results in venous leakage into the subdural space.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          The seepage of blood here is generally slower since it’s of venous origin.      Symptoms may appear weeks after the injury.      3. Subarachnoid Hematoma  Subarachnoid Hematoma → blood in the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater).  Cause → Typically due to a ruptured aneurysm; typically saccular/berry aneuryms (round outpouchings).          Recall that the cerebral vessels and the CSF run in the subarachnoid space.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          “Thunderclap” headache → extremely intense.      Nausea, vomiting, LOC.      Neck stiffness due to increased pressure on the meninges.      Visual changes.        Summary of Hematomas                    Type        Location        Cause        Symptoms                            Epidural        Between skull and dura mater        Fracture of pterion, resulting in tearing of the middle meningeal artery        Brief lucid interval followed by coma                    Subdural        Between dura mater and arachnoid mater        Acceleration-deceleration injury, resulting in tearing of the bridging veins        Often slow progression since venous flow is slower                    Subarachnoid        Between arachnoid mater and pia mater        Ruptured aneurysm, typically of a cerebral artery        Thunderclap headache, severe nausea, vomiting, LOC            Hydrocephalus  Hydrocephalus → ‘water in head’.          Caused by conditions where the CSF that’s produced in the brain can’t escape.      The accumulation of CSF puts pressure on the brain, which can cause serious consequences.      In patients &lt; 2 y/o with hydrocephalus, the sutures haven’t fused yet so the skull can expand to accomodate this growth.      This results in the infants that you see with massive skulls.        Hydrocephalus can be categorized as 2 types:          Non-communicating (aka. Obstructive) → the CSF can’t reach the subarachnoid space.      Communicating (aka. Non-Obstructuve) → the CSF can reach the subarachnoid space, but can’t drain into the venous sinuses via the arachnoid granulations.      Obstructive Hydrocephalus  Also known as non-communicating hydrocephalus.  Here, the CSF made in the ventricles can’t get out into the subarachnoid space.          As a result, the ventricles dilate due to continued CSF production and accumulation.      This pushes the cerebrum against the skull and flattens the gyri.      Non-Obstructive  Also known as communicating hydrocephalus.  Here, although the CSF can reach the subarachnoid space, the arachnoid granulations can’t drain the excess CSF.          This is usually a consequence of a bleed or meningitis, which scars the meninges.      This scarring blocks outflow of CSF via the arachnoid granulations.      Since the CSF can get into the subarachnoid space, but can’t get out, it ends up pushing the brain from the outside.        Intead of pushing the brain OUT from within (obstructive), here you’re pushing the brain IN from outside.          This is conceptually analogous to a subarachnoid hematoma.        Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus:          In some patients, the excess CSF distributes in the subarachnoid space so uniformly that there isn’t a marked rise in the ICP.      This is referred to as a normal pressure hydrocephalus.      In these patients, symptoms can be very non-specific: gait disorder, incontinence, dementia. In other words, it’s almost impossible to differentiate from old age!        Summary of Hydrocephalus                    Type        Cause        Result                            Obstructive (Non-Communicative)        CSF can’t get into subarachnoid space        CSF pushes the brain OUT from within                    Non-obstructive (Communicative)        CSF can get into the subrachnoid space, but can’t drain into the venous sinuses        CSF pushes the brain IN from outside            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/17/anatomy-cranial-cavity-2.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity I", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define the neurocranium and name the bones and sutures contributing to it.  Define the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae and list the main osteological features of each.  Describe the meninges, their specializations (dural folds, venous sinuses, arachnoid granulations), their relationship to one another, and their clinical significance with respect to intracranial hemorrhage.The Neurocranium  Objective      Define the neurocranium and name the bones and sutures contributing to it.    The skull is classically divided into 2 parts:          Neurocranium → the part that holds the brain.      Viscerocranium → the bones of the face.        Calvaria → roof of the neurocranium.  Cranial Base → floor of the neurocranium.Osteology of the Neurocranium  The bones of the neurocranium include:          Frontal Bone → single.      Parietal Bone → paired.      Sphenoid → single bone; located in the middle of the skull.      Temporal Bone → paired.      Occipital Bone → single.        Some features on the inferior aspect of the neurocranium are as follows:  On the temporal bone:    The reason our bones have bumps (tubercles, tuberosities, etc), are due to the attachments of structures, which act to gradually pull on the bone.          External Auditory Meatus → your ‘ear hole’, one on each temporal bone.      Mastoid Process → can be felt as a ‘bump’ behind your ear, formed due to the pulling action of the sternocleidomastoid.      Styloid Process → very pointed, and pronounced. Called ‘styloid’ because it’s shaped like a pen.        On the occipital bone:          Occipital condyles → this is what articulates with the atlas (C1), and allows you to nod.      Foramen magnum → ‘big window’, through which your brain stem and spinal cord exits the cranial cavity.      External occipital protuberance → where some muscles of the neck (eg. trapezius), and the ligamentum nuchae attach.      Sutures of the Neurocranium  Sutures → joints between the flat bones of the neurocranium.          Once they fuse, they don’t move together, but they are still considered joints.        The sutures are as follows:          Sagittal suture → easy to remember; in the sagittal plane, between the two parietal bones.      Coronal suture → separates the frontal bone from the two parietal bones.      Lambdoid suture → shaped like a λ, separates the occipital bone from the two parietal bones.      Frontal/Metopic suture → only present in infants because the frontal bone arises from two parts, which fuse later on. The suture between them is the metopic suture.        The flat bones grow into the sutures without requiring a cartilaginous template.          Recall from ITM (long time ago!) that the flat bones of the head are formed by intramembranous ossification.                  With intramembranous ossification, the bone forms directly from a mesenchymal membrane, without requiring a template.          Contrast this with the long bones in our body (arms, legs), which are formed by endochondral ossification, where a cartilaginous model gets ossified later.                      When you’re an infant, you have soft parts in your skull called fontanelles, which are large membranous openings between the bones of the skull.          These allow the bones to glide over each other during birth, and allow for the skull to fit through the vaginal opening.      Fontanelles disappear within 18 months of birth.        The sutures in infants also remain open to allow for rapid brain growth in the first couple of years.Clinical Application  Craniosynostosis → premature fusion of the cranial sutures.          This results in reduced growth in the region where the sutures fused prematurely.      The most common example is where the sagittal suture fuses prematurely, resulting in a narrow head.      In cases where the metopic suture (between the two pieces of the frontal bone) fuses too early, you can end up with a pointy forehead.        Craniosynostosis will result in abnormal brain development, unless the affected sutures are released (involving surgery).Landmarks of the Skull  These landmarks indicate where sutures of different bones meet.  Examples include:          Bregma → the intersection between the frontal and sagittal suture.      Lambda → the intersection between the lambdoid and sagittal suture.      Pterion → at the blending of the sutures between the temporal bone, parietal bone, and sphenoid bone. Forms an H shape.        Of these 3, the most clinically important landmark is the pterion, because it’s structurally where the skull is the thinnest.The Cranial Fossae  Objective      Define the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae and list the main osteological features of each.    The cranial fossae are depressions in the internal cranial base, and are formed by different parts of the brain.  The cranial fossae are as follows:          Anterior → contains the frontal lobes.      Middle → contains the temporal lobes.      Posterior → contains the cerebellum and brainstem.It was called the sella turcica (the Turkish seat) because of its resemblance to a saddle used by the Turks which had supports in the front and back.        In the centre of the middle cranial fossae is the region where the pituitary is held (recall, the sella turcica).  The height of each of these fossa is in descending order: the anterior fossa is the most shallow, and the posterior fossa is the deepest.          So if you poured water into the anterior cranial fossa, it would cascade down into the middle, and then posterior fossae.        Summary of the Cranial Fossae      There are 3 fossa that comprise the cranial base.                      Fossa        Contains                            Anterior        Frontal Lobes                    Middle        Temporal Lobes                    Posterior        Cerebellum &amp; Brainstem            Anterior Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Frontal Bone (green).      Sphenoid Bone (red).      Ethmoid Bone (yellow).        Frontal Component:          Although the frontal bone forms the front of the skull, it also reflects to form the roof of the orbit and the anterior cranial fossa.        Sphenoid Component:          The part in the anterior fossa is the lesser wing of the sphenoid, which is named relative to the greater wing, which you can see in the middle cranial fossa.      At the tips of the lesser wing of the sphenoid are the anterior clinoid processes (clinoid = bed post). These are also formed by the tugging of the dura.      In combination with the posterior clinoid processes in the middle fossa, these form a ‘4-poster bed’ that surrounds the pituitary.        Ethmoid Component:          The part of the ethmoid bone that forms the anterior cranial fossa is called the cribriform plate, which is named as such because it has many small holes that allow the olfactory nerves to get through to the nose.      Along the midline of the ethmoid is the crista galli (crest of the rooster), which sort of looks like a mohawk.                  The crista galli is formed by the tugging of the dura on the ethmoid.                    Middle Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Sphenoid Bone (red).      Temporal Bone (orange).      Parietal Bone (pink).        Note that the temporal bone has 2 parts:          Squamous → sheet-like; this is what we saw on the outside of the neurocranium.      Petrous → ‘like a rock’; this is the hardest bone in the body! The middle and inner ear are found here.        An important part of the middle cranial fossa is the sella turcica:          This is where the pituitary sits.      There are 3 parts which comprise the sella turcica:                  Hypophyseal fossa → aka. the pituitary fossa; this is the seat.          Tuberculum sellae → this is the anterior wall.          Dorsum sellae → this is posterior wall.                    Off the dorsum sellae are the posterior clinoid processes, which as we mentioned before, form a 4-poster bed along with the anterior clinoid processes.      Posterior Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Temporal Bone (orange).      Parietal Bone (pink).      Occipital Bone (purple).        Key components in the posterior fossa include:          Foramen magnum → where the spinal cord and brain stem exit the cranial cavity.      Clivus → latin for slope; refers to the little slide down into the foramen magnum where the medulla sits.      Internal occipital protuberance.      Internal occipital crest.        As with the crista galli, the internal occipital protuberance and internal occipital crest are formed by the pulling of the dura.The Meninges  Objective      Describe the meninges, their specializations (dural folds, venous sinuses, arachnoid granulations), their relationship to one another, and their clinical significance with respect to intracranial hemorrhage.    The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord, and consist of 3 layers:          Dura mater → ‘tough mother’; the tough outer layer.      Arachnoid mater → beneath the dura; named as such because of the spidery, web-like appearance of its fibres.      Pia mater → ‘tender mother’; referred to as such because it is faithful/clining; it adheres closely to the brain.      Dura Mater  Tough mother.  Comprised of an outer periosteal and inner meningeal layer.  The meningeal layer actually pulls off of the periosteal layer and folds in on itself to produce folds.  There is a potential space between the dura and the skull, and between the dura and arachnoid mater.          Epidural space → between the dura mater and skull.      Subdural space → between the dura and arachnoid mater.        Generally, there is no space in either of these; however, they can get filled as a result of injury (eg. with a epidural or subdural hematoma).  Additionally, wherever the inner meningeal layer reflects to form a fold, there is a gap formed between the outer periosteal and inner meningeal layers.          Within these gaps are venous sinuses; this will be shown later on.      Arachnoid Mater  Spider-like.  Thin, transparent membrane.  Covers the brain, but does not enter the sulci.  Separated from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space.  Unlike the epidural and subdural space, the subarachnoid space is a realized space.          The CSF and cerebral arteries and veins are located in the subarachnoid space.        In addition, there are arachnoid granulations, which are projections that pop through the dura mater and interact with the venous sinuses there.          These function to drain excess CSF, in order to maintain the intracranial pressure.      Pia Mater  Faithful, clinging.  Thin, delicate membrane.  Adherent to the surface of the brain → unlike the arachnoid mater, this goes into the sulci.Meningitis  Meningitis → inflammation of the meninges.          Typically caused by a virus, but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and even some drugs.        Symptoms: headache, fever, drowsiness.  Can lead to: inflammation and sepsis, coma, death.Signs of Meningitis  Kernig’s Sign → straight leg raises causes marked pain/discomfort in the neck.  Brudzinski’s Sign → the opposite; here, you lift up the neck, and the legs involvuntarily lift up.  Nuchal Ridigity → an inability to flex the neck due to rigid muscles.  Lumbar Puncture → take a sample of the LSF.          Taken at the level of L4 (PSIS); recall from MSK that this is done to avoid the spinal cord.        Kernig’s sign and Brudzinski’s sign are highly specific, but not very sensitive; hence they’re good for ruling-in meningitis.  Summary of the Meninges      Meninges cover and help protect the brain    3 layers of meninges:              Outermost layer is dura mater        Middle layer is arachnoid mater        Innermost layer is pia mater              Potential space between dura mater and skull isepidural space    Potential space between dura mater and arachnoidmater is subdural space    Real space between arachnoid mater and pia mater issubarachnoid space               This is where cerebral arteries and veins and CSF run              Meningitis = inflammation of meninges.  Dural Folds  As mentioned previously, the inner meningeal layer of the dura mater separates from the outer periosteal layer to form folds.  These function to separate regions of the brain, and prevent the brain from moving around too much.  The largest and most important fold is the cerebral falx; this is a fold that separates the L and R hemispheres of the brain.          Attaches to frontal crest, crista galli, internal occipital protuberance and the midline of the calvaria.        In addition, there is the cerebellar tentorium.            It’s named as such because it acts as a tent for the cerebellum.      This separates the cerebellum from the cerebrum.      Continuous with the cerebral falx.      There is a ‘tentorial notch’ anteriorly that allows the brainstem to pass through.        Other dural folds include:          Sella Diaphragm → forms a roof over the pituitary, with a small opening for the infundibulum (pituitary stalk). Like a blanket over the pituitary (to go along with the 4-poster bed).      Cerebellar falx → similarly to the cerebral falx, this partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres.        Summary of Dural Folds                    Name        Location                            Cerebral Falx        Between the L and R hemispheres of the cerebral cortex                    Cerebellar Tentorium        Forms a ‘tent’ over the cerebellum                    Sella Diaphragm        Covers the pituitary; small opening for the stalk                    Cerebellar Falx        Partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres            Venous Drainage of the Cranial Cavity  As mentioned before, these form between the outer periosteal and inner meningeal layers of the dura; hence, they’re surrounded by dura mater.          Large veins from the brain empty into sinuses which ultimately drain into the internal jugular veins (IJV).      In addition, the veins also serve to receive CSF from the arachnoid granulations (mentioned previously).        Along the cerebral falx, there are 2 important venous sinuses:          Superior sagittal sinus → along the top fold.      Inferior sagittal sinus → along the bottom fold.        The superior sagittal sinus travels all the way to the back of the head, to the confluence of the sinuses.  The inferior sagittal sinus stops at the anterior border of the cerebellar tentorium, and then connects to the confluence via the straight sinus.  From the confluence of the sinuses, the blood then goes transversely through the transverse sinuses, and then through a s-shaped sigmoid sinus.  Finally, they exit through the jugular foramen.          Aptly, once the sigmoid sinuses leaves the jugular foramen, they’re no longer called sigmoid sinuses, but  instead called internal jugular veins.        The arachnoid granulations are located primarily along the superior sagittal sinus, and also in lateral offshoots called lateral venous lacunae.  As mentioned before, this is where excess CSF leaves the cranial cavity.  Because of the pressure created by these lacunae, you can actually see depressions on the inside of the skull!   Venous Drainage of the Skull      There are 2 main sinuses along the skull; the superior sagittal sinus, and the inferior sagittal sinus.    The superior sagittal sinus drains directly into the confluence; the interior sagittal sinus drains indirectly via the straight sinus.    Once blood reaches the confluence, it travels along the side of the skull via transverse sinuses, and then into an s-shaped vessel called the sigmoid sinus.    The sigmoid sinus passes through the jugular foramen; once it passes this, it’s now known as the internal jugular vein.  The Cavernous Sinus  The cavernous sinus is probably the most clinically important sinus.          Unlike the other venous sinuses, which form tubes, this is more of a plexus.                  As a result, blood in the cavernous sinus is more sluggish, and is more prone to infection.                    In addition, the cavernous sinus is an important area of venous communication; it connects to a number of places outside the cranial cavity, such as the face, jaws, etc.      POTENTIAL ROUTE FOR INFECTION → an infection can start from outside the neurocranium, and get inside via the cavernous sinus!        Clinical Examples:            One example of how an infection can track into the brain is via the facial vein, which communicates with the ophthalmic vein, which then communicates with the cavernous sinus.      As a result, an infection in the danger triangle (shown right), can track into facial vein → ophthalmic vein → cavernous sinus → meningitis.      So if you’re really unlucky, and you have a gruesome pimple there, you could get meningitis!!      Another example is with a tooth infection, which could track to the pterygoid venous plexus → cavernous sinus → infection.      The petrosal sinuses are named as such because they relate to the petrosal portion of the temporal bone.  The cavernous sinus communicates with the rest of the sinuses of the skull via petrosal sinuses.          Superior petrosal → runs along the border of the middle and posterior cranial fossae, and enters the sigmoid sinus.      Inferior petrosal → typically drains into the internal jugular (past the jugular foramen), but sometimes drains into the sigmoid instead.        Importantly, everything leaves through the jugular foramen.  Remember      The cavernous sinus is an important route through which an infection could track into the brain.    It drains via superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, into the sigmoid sinus/IJV.  Relations of the Cavernous Sinus  The cavernous sinus lies around the sella turcica and pituitary; hence it’s near a lot of vulnerable structures.  These include:          Optic tract.  Interestingly, the internal carotid artery actually runs through the cavernous sinus (an artery runs through a vein)! This is the only place in the body where this happens.      Internal carotid artery      Abducens (CN VI) → runs with the ICA.      Oculomotor (CN III)      Trochlear (CN IV)      Ophthalmic (V1 of Trigeminal)      Maxillary (V2 of Trigeminal)        So what could happen with a cavernous sinus infection?          Problems with eye tracking (CN III, IV, VI).      Abnormal sensation in the ophthalmic and maxillary regions (V1 &amp; V2).      If the infection came from the ophthalmic vein, then eye problems may be seen too.        These symptoms are described as Cavernous Sinus Syndrome:          Presentation → think of the surrounding structures:                  Orbital or facial pain, orbital swelling and chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), fever, oculomotor neuropathy, trigeminal neuropathy.                    Causeds → anything in or nearby the cavernous sinus.                  Typically from cavernous thrombosis, due to infection.          Also can be caused by carotid aneurysms (ICA runs through cavernous sinus), carotid-cavernous fistulas, meningiomas, or pituitary tumours.                      Cavernous Sinus Syndrome      Caused by anything that causes pressure near the cavernous sinus.    The symptoms that it causes can be deduced from the surrounding anatomy:              Internal Carotid Artery.        Motor Innervation to Eye → CN III, IV, VI.        Sensory Innervation to Upper Face → V1 and V2 of CN V.            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/17/anatomy-cranial-cavity-1.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cerebrum", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Know the names and locations of the major sulci, fissures and the name location and border of the lobes of the cerebral cortex.  Know the names, locations and function of the motor, sensory and association areas of the cerebral cortex.Major Regions of the Brain  Cerebrum = the largest part of the brain, and includes the cerebral cortex.  Parts of the brain include:          Cerebrum.      Diencephalon.      Midbrain.      Pons.      Medulla Oblongata.      Cerebellum &amp; Spinal Cord.        Through our neuroanatomy lectures, we’ll be working from the top down, starting from the cerebrum.The CerebrumOverview of the Cerebrum  The cerebrum is comprised of 3 parts:          Cerebral cortex (aka. gray matter) → comprised of neurons.      Cerebral white matter → comprised of axons; this serves to connect different regions of the cerebral cortex and the subcortical structures.      Deep gray matter → made up of the basal ganglia.        The cerebral cortex is split into 2 hemispheres, the L and R hemisphere.  In humans, we have a gyrencephalic brain (the cortex has folds), while in smaller mammals like rodents, they have a lissencephalic brain (the cortex is smooth).          Another important differentiator is the amount of cerebral white matter; humans have significantly more neural interconnections.        Remember      The cerebrum is comprised of (1) cerebral cortex, (2) cerebral white matter, and (3) deep gray matter.    The cerebral cortex is comprised of neurons; the cerebral white matter is comprised of axonal interconnections.  Overview of the Cerebral Hemispheres  The two cerebral hemispheres is the largest part of the brain; it comprises 83% of the total brain mass.  Different regions have different functions:          Sensory.      Motor.      Multi-modal Association Areas (perception &amp; interpretation).        The surface of the cerebral cortex has grooves and ridges.          Gyri = ridges.      Sulci = grooves.        When a sulcus is particularly deep, it’s instead referred to as a fissure.  Some of these gyri and sulci are consistent between brains, and help provide an anatomical landmark to separate different regions.Lobes of the Cerebrum  The cerebrum has 5 lobes (paired):          Frontal.      Parietal.      Temporal.      Occipital.      Insular (hidden; insulated)        The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by the central sulcus.  The frontal and temporal separated by the lateral (sylvian) fissure.  The occipital and parietal lobes are aptly separated by the parietal occipital sulcus.  The insular lobe is hidden beneath the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.          As shown to the right, if you reflect these apart, then you can see the insular lobe hiding underneath.      This is why the insular lobe is named as such; it’s ‘insulated’ by the other lobes.      Subdivisions of the Major Lobes  On either side of the central sulcus (separating the frontal and parietal lobes), are two gyri:          The precentral gyrus is the primary somatomotor cortex.      The postcentral gyrus is the primary somatosensory cortex.        Hence, the precentral gyrus lies in the frontal lobe; the postcentral gyrus lies in the parietal lobe.  Before the precentral gyrus, and after the postcentral gyrus, there are another two conserved grooves:          Precentral sulcus.      Postcentral sulcus.        This can be seen to the right; there are 3 sulci (precentral, central, and postcentral), and 2 gyri (precentral and postcentral).  This process of subdivision makes it possible to further classify components of each of the lobes (see right).          Although this may seem complicated, the naming is fairly straightforward.      For example, the frontal lobe can be split into a superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus, which are split by a superior and inferior frontal sulcus.      You don’t need to remember these subdivisions.        Brodmann Classification → this was an attempt to classify the areas of the brain based on their cellular composition; 52 distinct areas were identified.Development of the Cerebral Cortex  The cerebral cortex and lateral ventricles developed originally as a c-shaped structure.  More details are described in the IL; you have to do it; it will be tested!  Key Points on the Cerebrum      The cerebrum is composed of:              Cerebral cortex (gray matter) → neurons.        Cerebral white matter → axons.        Deep gray matter → basal ganglia.              Different anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex have different functional roles; functions include:              Sensory.        Motor.        Multi-modal association (perception, interpretation.)              Gryi = ridges, sulci = folds. Deep sulci are known as fissures.    The cerebral cortex and the lateral ventricles formed a c-shape during development.    Key Points on the Cerebral Lobes      The (paired) lobes of the cerebral cortex include:              Frontal Lobe        Parietal Lobe        Temporal Lobe        Occipital Lobe        Insular Lobe              The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by the central sulcus.    The parietal and occipital lobes are separated by the parietal occipital sulcus.    The temporal and frontal/parietal lobes are separated by the lateral (sylvian) fissure.    The insular cortex is buried beneath the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes and can be seen if these lobes are pulled out of the way.    Anterior to the central sulcus is the precentral gyrus, which is the primary motor cortex.    Posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus, which is the primary sensory cortex.    The major lobes can be subdivided based on the prominent sulci that they contain and their location on the lobe (superior, middle or inferior positions on the lobe). Brodmann mapped 47 different regions of the cortex.  Sensory Regions of the Cortex  The sensory regions of the cortex are ALL located behind the central sulcus.  In addition to the postcentral gyrus which we mentioned previously, there are other key sensory regions.  These sensory regions can either be classified as primary, or secondary.          Primary sensory areas are responsible for the reception of sensory information.      Secondary sensory areas are responsible for the processing of sensory information.        For instance, the primary visual cortex is a primary sensory area. It’s responsible for the reception of visual information, but not it’s interpretation (eg. it doesn’t mediate object recognition).  Object recognition is instead mediated by the visual association area, which is a secondary sensory area.Primary Sensory Areas of the Cortex  In addition to the primary somatosensory area (the postcentral gyrus, which we mentioned earlier), there are a few other primary sensory areas of the cortex:          Primary visual cortex → located at the very back of the occipital lobe. This is responsible for the reception of visual information, but not it’s interpretation (eg. it doesn’t mediate object recognition).      Primary auditory cortex → lies on the superior aspect of the temporal lobe, near the primary somatosensory cortex.      Gustatory Cortex → this is responsible for taste, and it lies at the very bottom of the primary somatosensory area.      Visceral Cortex (not shown) → this is where visceral information is fed to. It’s not seen on the diagram because it’s located on the insular cortex.      Secondary Sensory Areas of the Cortex  Information flows from the primary sensory areas (which receive information), to the secondary sensory areas (which make sense of the information).  Secondary sensory regions of the cortex include:          Somatosensory Association Cortex → responsible for interpreting touch, vibration, and proprioception information. Located just behind the primary somatosensory area.      Visual Association Area → responsible for interpreting visual information. Located just in front of the primary visual cortex.      Auditory Association Area → responsible for identifying auditory information, but not speech comprehension.      Wernicke’s Area → the auditory association area feeds into Wernicke’s area, where speech comprehension takes place.                  In 90% of individuals, Wernicke’s area is on the left side.          So what is the corresponding region on the right side being used for? Studies suggest that it’s also somewhat involved in speech, but also plays a big role in understanding emotional context.    Classically, the olfactory cortex is referred to as a ‘primary’ sensory area, but evidence suggests that the olfactory bulb itself has a primary function, and the olfactory cortex plays a larger role in association. See here.                    Olfactory Cortex (not shown) → this isn’t easily seen on the exterior of the cortex; it’s located on a medial bulge on the temporal lobe called the uncus.        Also shown to the right is the calcarine sulcus, which extends into the brain.  This is important because the primary visual cortex runs on either side of the calcarine sulcus.  The part that can be seen on the outside of the cortex is only a small part of the actual visual cortex.Summary of the Sensory Areas of the Cortex  Primary Sensory Regions                    Name        Location        Function                            Primary Somatosensory Area        Postcentral Gyrus        Reception of touch, vibration, proprioception info                    Primary Visual Cortex        Back of the Occipital Lobe        Reception of visual information                    Primary Auditory Cortex        Top of temporal lobe, near primary somatosensory area        Reception of auditory information                    Gustatory Cortex        Bottom of the primary somatosensory area        Reception of taste information                    Visceral Cortex        Insular lobe        Reception of visceral information              Secondary Sensory Regions                    Name        Location        Function                            Somatosensory Association Cortex        Posterior to the postcentral Gyrus        Interpretation of touch, vibration, proprioception info                    Visual Association Area        Anterior to primary visual cortex        Integration of visual information                    Auditory Association Area        Posterior to primary auditory cortex        Interpretation of auditory information, but not speech recognition                    Wernicke’s Area        Deep to auditory association area, generally on the left side (ie. right-brain-dominant people)        Speech interpretation                    Olfactory Cortex        Medial bulge on temporal lobe (uncus)        Interpretation of olfactory information            Motor Regions of the Cortex  The motor regions of the cortex are ALL located in front of the central sulcus.  Motor regions of the cortex include:          Primary Motor Cortex → contains pyramidal cells, which send impulses to spinal cells and and out to muscles in order to produce movement.      Premotor Cortex → as the name suggests, is located anterior to the primary motor cortex.                  Just like how the somatosensory association cortex integrates information from the primary somatosensory area, the premotor cortex helps plan and coordinate more complex movements.                    Broca’s Area → the ventral part of the premotor cortex, which specifically controls movements necessary to speech.                  Broca’s area is dependent on Wernicke’s area. Although Broca’s is needed for speech, Wernicke’s is necessary for you to understand what you want to say.          Hence, in order to have proper speech, you need both Broca’s and Wernicke’s area to be functional.                      Summary of the Motor Areas of the Cortex                    Name        Location        Function                            Primary Motor Cortex        Precentral Gyrus        Contains pyramidal cells which send impulses down to muscles                    Premotor Cortex        Anterior to the primary motor cortex        Helps plan and coordinate complex motor movements                    Broca’s Area        Ventral part of premotor cortex        Control of muscles involved in speech            Sensory &amp; Motor Homunculi  In both the primary somatosensory cortex (the postcentral gyrus), and the primary motor cortex (the precentral gyrus), there are anatomic regions that map to different body parts.          These maps are referred to as homunculi.      For both the sensory and motor homunculi, their orientation is upside down; that is, the region corresponding to the feet is at the top of the brain, and the region corresponding to the head is at the bottom.        The size of each region of these primary cortices relates to the sensitivity or dexterity of the corresponding body part.          On the somatosensory side, it relates to the sensitivity of that part of the body (the digits and lips are more heavily weighted; the trunk is less heavily weighted).      On the motor side, it relates to the dexterity of that part of the body (the face and hand is heavily weighted; the legs are less weighted).        Importantly, the somatosensory and somatomotor control is crossed.          That is, the left somatosensory cortex receives sensory information from the right side of the body, and vice versa.      Similarly, the left motor cortex sends instructions to the &lt;/i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; side of the body.      Multimodal Association Areas  Although the secondary sensory areas of the cortex let you interpret information from different senses, they don’t allow for the integration of this information.  Multimodal association areas resolve this by allowing for the integration of multiple modalities. These include:          PMAA → Posterior Multimodal Association Area.      AMAA → Anterior Multimodal Association Area.      Limbic Region        PMAA (Posterior Multimodal Association Area)          Also known as the general association or Gnostic cortex.      Located on the temporal + parietal lobes.      Since it’s on the posterior cortex (near all the sensory regions), it’s involved in the integration of sensations (tactile, visual, etc).      Gives you an awareness of the spatial location of the body, how to move your body through space, and to make sense of the environment.      This is also where we generate ideas on what we want to do.      Note that the PMAA receives processed information from the secondary sensory areas.        AMAA (Anterior Multimodal Association Area)          Receives information from PMAA, integrates it with past experience, evaluates options, and selects an appropriate response.      Includes your working memory.      Involved in personal and social interactions.      Executive area for task management.        Limbic Region          Responsible for memory and emotion.      Will be saved for a later lecture.      Within cerebral cortex, key region involved is the cingulate gyrus, which is c-shaped and lies right on top of this band of fibres called the corpus callosum, which connects the L &amp; R hemispheres.      Flow of Information Through the CortexFibre Connections of the Cerebrum  The fibre connections of the cerebrum form the white matter; they’re comprised of axon bundles.  Depending on the starting point and the ending point of these fibres, they are given different names.  Generally speaking, there are 3 types of fibres:          Association Fibres.      Commissural Fibres.      Projection Fibres.        Association Fibres are fibres that connect two regions that are in the same hemisphere. They can either be short or long:          Short → an association fibre that starts and ends in the same lobe.      Long → an association fibre that travels between lobes.        Commissural Fibres are fibres that travel between the two hemispheres.          The largest bundle of these is a commisural fibre pathway known as the corpus callosum.      It is the main connection between the left and right hemispheres of the brain.        Projection Fibres are fibres that connect the cerebral cortex to the subcortical structures.          These are the fibres that connect the cortex to the rest of the brain.      Afferent fibres heading to the cortex, and efferent fibres leaving the cortex merge in a large bundle of fibres called the internal capsule, which distributes to the subcortical parts of the brain.      When the internal capsule reaches the cortex, the fibres branch out to connect to different regions; this forms what’s known as the corona radiata.        Summary of White Matter      There are 3 types of fibres in the brain:              Association Fibres → between regions on the same hemisphere of the cortex.                      Short association fibres → between regions on the same lobe, on the same hemisphere.            Long association fibres → between regions on different lobes, on the same hemisphere.                          Commissural Fibres → between regions on different hemispheres.        Projection Fibres → between the cortex and the subcortical regions.            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/anatomy-cerebrum.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Neuroanatomy", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Know and understand the basic functions of the nervous system and the divisions responsible for these functions.  Know the anatomical parts of a neuron, the types of neurons and support cells and compare the types of neurons found in the nervous system.Functional Neuroanatomy  CNS (Central Nervous System) → brain &amp; spinal cord.           Functions as an integration and command centre.        PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) → nerves &amp; ganglia.          Acts as a communication link between the CNS and the end organs.        Divisions of the PNS            Sensory aka. afferent (inward) division      Motor aka. efferent (outward) division      Both the sensory and motor divisions of the PNS can be subdivided into somatic and visceral systems:                  Somatic (innervate areas which interact with the environment).          Visceral (innervate areas within your body); also called autonomic.                    The visceral (autonomic) motor system can be further divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.        Somatosensory innervation includes touch sense, vibration sense, and proprioception.Example  Below is an example of how the brain elicits visceral motor changes, namely cardiovascular change in response to mental stress.  In the population, there are 2 different populations of people, that react to stress differently:          Cardiovascular reactors to mental stress      Cardiovascular non-reactors to mental stress.        A study done here in London, exposed these two groups to stress (eg. mental math).          Some students had a significant increase in HR; others did not.        What regions of the brain mediates the differences in this response?          DLPFC (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex) and INS (insular cortex) activity was seen in non-reactors, none was seen in reactors.        Summary of Functional Neuroanatomy      The nervous system is responsible for many many simple andcomplex functions    The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinalcord and is an integration and command center.    The PNS the Peripheral is made up of nerves and ganglia and primarily a communication link.    The four major divisions of the peripheral nervous system are:              Somatosensory → afferent information from the environment.        Somatomotor → efferent commands out to skeletal muscles.        Visceral sensory → afferent information from organs and blood vessels.        Visceral motor → efferent output to the organs and blood vessels).              Visceral NS = autonomic NS.    Regions in the CNS are also responsible for these four components, while others are more involved in integrating responses  Anatomy of the Neuron  Dendrite → where impulses are received.  Axons → where impulses are sent through.  Cell Body.  Nucleus.  Myelin Sheath → insulates the neuron to increase conduction speed.Types of Neurons  Neurons are defined as unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar.  The distinction is based on the number of cellular projection from the cell body.   Unipolar neurons only have 1 projection, bipolar neurons have 2, and multipolar ones have multiple projections.          Multipolar Neuron                  99% of neurons.          Consists of many dendrites, and one long axon; hence there are multiple projections coming from the cell body.          Include motor neurons and interneurons (which mediate reflex arcs).                     Unipolar Neurons                  Sensory neurons.          Here, the cell body is connected to the peripheral processes by a single branch, so it is ‘unipolar’ (see below).          In the body, these cell bodies actually bunch together; this is what forms ganglia!                     Bipolar Neurons                  Seen with special sensory organs (such as the eyes).          Bipolar neurons are mainly located in the retina of the eye.                       Summary of Neuron Types                    Type        Characteristic        Examples                            Multipolar        Multiple projections from cell body        Motor neurons, interneurons                    Unipolar        One projection from cell body        Sensory neurons                    Bipolar        Two projections from cell body        Special sensory organs            Myelination of Neurons  Myelination allows for more rapid conduction of nerve impulses, by allowing the impulses to jump between interruptions in the sheath (Nodes of Ranvier).  This jumping is known as saltatory conduction.  Schwann cells create the myelin sheath in the PNS.  Oligodendrocytes create the myelin sheath in the CNS.  Not all nerves are myelinated ones; in cases where fast conduction isn’t required (eg. some visceral nerves), nerves aren’t myelinated.  Remember      Schwann cells create the myelin sheath in the PNS.    Oligodendrocytes create the myelin sheath in the CNS.    Neurons are fragile; they also need support cells.          These cells are known as astrocytes; they have a number of functions, including the buffering of glutamate and calcium.      The also form a neurovascular unit by communicating with the vasculature; this is the medium through which neurons are supplied.      Nomenclature of Neuronal Groupings  The naming of collections of neurons (or cell bodies) differs depending on whether you’re dealing with the CNS or PNS.          In the PNS, a collection of cell bodies is called a ganglia; in the CNS, a collection of cell bodies is called a nucleus.      In the PNS, a collection of neurons is called a nerve; in the CNS, there are many possible terms, including tract, fasciculus, column, funiculus, and lemniscus.        There is one notable exception; there is a large collection of neuronal cell bodies in the CNS called the basal ganglia, and not the basal nucleus.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/intro-neuroanatomy.html"},

Covers all material from weeks 1-6, greater emphasis on all clinical material.      MCQ and short answer, many questions will be case based.      Tips for this Course  A huge amount of information is covered in a very small time period.  Don’t skip the IL’s → they ARE on the exams (recall MSK…).  Learn your neuroanatomy well.  Prepare in advance.  Consider completing the practice quizzes and look at the additional resources.          There are 2 other sets of practice questions in the additional resources.        MSK &amp; Neuro integration problems are new this year.          Aim to integrate neuro and MSK issues and make things more integrative.        PCCIA: New topic; Social accountability.          New topic → Social Accountability.      Group Project → Development of a hospital policy on Physician Assisted Death.      Example Questions  What is pyramidal distribution weakness?          Here, leg flexor weakness &gt; leg extensor weakness.      If you have a brain/spinal cord problem (pyramidal aka Upper Motor Neurone weakness), you end up with this.                  In the arms, the flexors are stronger than the extensors, so the arms are bent.          In the legs, the extensors are stronger than the flexors, so the legs can’t bend well.                      What is the DDx for acute onset of aphasia (difficulty producing +/- understanding speech)?          Ischemic stroke.      Hemorrhagic stroke (intracranial hemorrhage).      Migraine aura.  When patients have a seizure in the part of the brain involving speech, then that part may be so exhausted that it can’t function normally.      Seizures (post ictal Todd’s deficit, will see later).      Psychogenic (intentionally/unintentionally ‘faking’ symptoms).                  Intentionally → Malingering.          Unintentionally → Conversion disorder.                    Suggested Resources  Cecil’s Essentials of Medicine → Very good resource.  Blumenfeld’s “Neuroanatomy through Clinical cases”          Chapter 2 is a good exam review.      Expensive (~ $100).      Useful Terms  Plegia → paralysis; essentially no voluntary movement.  Paresis → weakness.  Ataxia → difficulties with motor coordination.  Dominant hemisphere:          The hemisphere where language is housed (not necessarily )      Typically the left hemisphere in right handers.      With left handers, half of people will have a dominant right hemisphere, and the other half will have a dominant left (just like righties).        MCA → middle cerebral artery.          Common place for a stroke to occur.      An MCA stroke causes face and arm &gt; leg contralateral weakness, due to the arrangement of the neural homunculus.        Homunculus → a spatial mapping of the parts of the brain which control different parts of the brain.          The man in the motor cortex is ‘standing on its head’ (ie, the legs are controlled by the top of the brain, then the arms, then the face).      Motor Homunculus → areas which require finer detail have a larger neural representation (eg. face, hands); areas which require less (eg. feet) have a smaller representation.      Sensory Homunculus → different from the motor homunculus; sensitive regions like the lips and fingers are more heavily represented.        Different regions of the homunculus supplies different regions of the homunculus.                  ACA supplies the leg component.          MCA supplies the hand and face.          PCA supplies the eyes.                    ACA = Anterior Cerebral Artery.       MCA = Middle Cerebral Artery.      PCA = Posterior Cerebral Artery.      These 3 arteries come out from the Circle of Willis (which we’ll see later).      Imaging Axes  Just like what we saw with MSK:          Sagittal.      Axial (transverse).      Coronal (frontal).      General Approach to Neurological Problems  What is the problem? → History and P/E.  Where is the lesion? → localization.  What is the DDx?          Using key points on the history and the localization      What is the most likely diagnosis?      What should I not miss (treatable Dx, serious Dx)?        What investigations should be ordered?  Are treatments possible?Case Example  Case Summary      A 24 year old woman was physically fit and very healthy. One evening, she notices some tingling in both feet. Assuming she’s just over tired, she heads to bed. The next morning she stumbles after getting out of bed, and finds her legs feel very weak. She makes an appointment to see her GP the next day.    The next day, she cannot walk independently and needs to have support from her friend to walk. Her arms now feel weak and she has difficulty getting dressed.    In the GPs office, she has bilateral and relatively symmetrical weakness in her arms and legs. Her reflexes are absent. Her sensory examination is normal.    Key points:          Bilateral, symmetric weakness.      Reflexes are absent.      Sensory findings → tingling.      Sensory exam is normal.        What is the problem?          Subacute onset of progressive generalized weakness associated with areflexia and normal sensory exam, despite mild sensory symptoms.        Where is the lesion?          Not the brain nor the brain, recall that you would expect hyper-reflexia.      Hence this is a lower motor neuron problem, but probably isn’t due to a problem with the muscle, or neuromuscular junction, since there are sensory symptoms (tingling) as well.      Hence this is probably a peripheral nerve problem.        What is the DDx?          Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) until proven otherwise.        What shouldn’t you miss? (treatable, serious)          Acute spinal cord pathology (can cause shock and lead to paradoxical short term hyporeflexia).      Myasthenia gravis, inflammatory mypopathy, botulism, tick paralysis, etc.        What investigations should be ordered?          Nerve conduction study.      Lumbar puncture (LP).                  With GBS, will see albuminocytologic dissociation, which is pathognomonic.          This is an elevation in the CSF proteins, without an elevation in the WBCs (hence a ‘dissociation’).                      Are treatments possible?          IVIG → shortens the duration of symptoms, and gets them better faster.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/intro-neuroscience-eye-ear.html"},
