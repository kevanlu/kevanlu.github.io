	{"title": "Child Health Small Groups &ndash; Febrile Seizures &amp; the Floppy Infant", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Given a history of a child presenting with a paroxysmal event and fever, list a differential diagnosis.  Describe the characteristic features of typical (simple) febrile seizures and atypical (complex) febrile seizures.  For a child with a febrile seizure, determine whether investigations are indicated.  In a child with a febrile seizure, outline a treatment plan and provide a prognosis.  Describe the aspects of the history and physical examination that would support a diagnosis of meningitis in a child with a fever and seizure.  List preventive strategies, complications and long term prognosis for childhood meningitis.Case #1  Case Summary  You are asked to evaluate Markus, a 15 month old boy, brought to the emergency department by ambulance.  What would be your first step?          ABCs, Vitals.        Additional Information  Marcus is quiet in his mother’s arms. When you move him to the examining table he begins to cry. He is pink in room air. Air entry is equal bilaterally.  RR = 25 HR = 165 BP = 88/52 Temp = 39.4 C  You obtain some additional history from Markus’ mother:  Markus was well until this morning when he developed a fever (39.5-40 C). His mother gave him a 120 mg of acetaminophen. About 20 minutes ago, Markus was sitting with his mother when Markus’ eyes rolled back and both arms and legs began to shake. He looked pale and did not respond to his name. Markus mother was very alarmed and her husband called 911. The shaking stopped after 4-5 minutes and Markus went limp. He never stopped breathing. In the ambulance Markus woke up and began crying. Now he is drowsy, but seems to be returning to his usual self.  In general, what conditions would you consider for a paroxysmal event such as this? What would be most likely in a 15 month old?          Meningitis; in this case, since he has a fever.      More generally, seizure and syncope are the most common causes for a transient LOC.      Other causes include hypoglycemia, migraines, BPPV, and breath-holding spells.        What further information would you want to get in the history?          Take a full pediatric history; focus on family history.      Events before and after the seizure.      Immunizations, allergies, medications, as usual.        What are the most common considerations in the differential diagnosis for seizures associated with fever? What is the most likely diagnosis for Markus?          Most common diagnosis: simple febrile seizure.      You would want to rule out meningitis.        How are febrile seizures defined? How common are febrile seizures? At what age do they occur most often?          Febrile seizure → seizure associated with high body temperature, with no other systemic findings.      Up to 5% of children will get them.      They occur most often between the ages of 6 months to 6 years.        Additional Information  Markus had been unwell for 1 day with a high fever, cough and nasal congestion. Just prior to the seizure, he was alert but resting in his mother’s arms. There is no vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or fussiness.  Past medical history is unremarkable.  Family history is significant for an uncle who has epilepsy and a cousin with febrile seizures.  How are febrile seizures classified?          Simple (benign) → lasts less 15 minutes, does not recur within a 24 hour period, no neurologic findings.      Complex (atypical) → focal features OR lasts longer than 15 minutes OR pre-existing neurological conditions OR more than 1 in 24 hours OR outside of normal age range (6 mo to 6 years).        What would you look for on the physical exam?          Signs of meningitis → Kernig’s, Brudzinski’s, nuchal rigidity, headache, fever, etc.      Signs of infection.      Growth parameters.      Skin findings suggestive of an underlying diagnosis.        Additional Information  On exam: Height = 83 cm Weight = 12.6 kg HC = 48.8 cm  He is alert, prefers to be with his mother, and is otherwise is in no distress. His mother says he is quieter than usual. There is no bruising or neurocutaneous stigmata. Anterior fontanelle is just palpable and almost closed. Pupils are equal and reactive. Extra ocular movements are conjugate. The red reflex is present bilaterally and the fundi are normal. There is no sunsetting of the eyes. The Brudzinski and Kernig signs are difficult to assess. Neurologically, he moves both arms and legs equally. His tone appears normal.  His mouth exam shows moist mucosa without erythema. There is a clear nasal discharge. The tympanic membranes are non-inflamed. Respirations are regular. The rest of the examination is normal.  What do you conclude?          Growth parameters are normal; 95th percentile for age. No micro or macrocephaly.      Neuro exam is normal; suggests it’s likely benign.      Sounds like a simple febrile seizure.        Additional Information  A dose of acetaminophen is given and he improves considerably over the next 30 minutes. His mother reports that he is back to his usual self.  What investigations would you do for Markus?          CBC, lytes, glucose.       Would you do a lumbar puncture? Probably not, since he seems to be improving.      Would you do an EEG? Not recommended; after a simple febrile seizure, may often find changes on EEG, but they often don’t mean anything; no predictive value for prognosis.        Should this child be admitted?          No; he seems healthy.      It ultimately depends on their social situation; if it’s a single parent or they live far away from the hospital, admitting them might be better.        Under what circumstances should a child be admitted?          Very young.      Abnormalities on bloodwork.      Growth abnormalities.      Residual neurological deficits, focal neurological symptoms.      Signs of meningitis.      Social circumstance; distressed parents, single parent, lives far away.        How would you treat Markus once he’s home?          Tylenol/ibuprofen for comfort.      Reassure parents that isolated simple febrile seizures have no long term consequences; prognosis for development is very good.      Tell them that if they have another seizure, wait 5 minutes if seizes again; if longer than 5 minutes, call EMS right away.        What is the prognosis for children with simple febrile seizures?          Prognosis is very good; no impact on long-term development or IQ.        What is the probability of developing epilepsy?          Up to 4%.      Baseline ~ 1%.        What factors increase the risk of recurrent febrile seizures?          Increased risk of epilepsy: FHx, complex vs simple seizures, # of seizures, AbN neurological exam.      Increased risk of febrile seizures: younger age of onset, mildness of fever, time between onset of fever and onset of seizure.        How would you counsel Markus’ mother?          Reassure mother as before.      Wouldn’t recommend an anti-epileptic since this is a simple febrile seizure.      If have another seizure:                  Put on side; to prevent airway obstruction.          Contact EMS if seizures haven’t stopped after 5 minutes.                    In rare situations, extreme parental anxiety about recurrent, severe simple febrile seizures warrants prophylaxis at the beginning of each febrile illness. This is not routinely recommended. Oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg Q8 hours at the beginning of a febrile illness) is the only medication recommended in such circumstances.      Case #2  Case Summary  Six year old Sammy presents to the emergency department with fever, lethargy and a possible seizure. Sammy was well until 3 days ago when he developed fever, malaise, clear nasal discharge and decreased appetite. Sammy’s mother suspected an ear infection. This morning Sammy complained of head and neck pain and was given ibuprofen. He stayed home from school. He had little energy and looked pale. He vomited twice.  Approximately 20 minutes before arrival in the ER, Sammy’s left arm and leg began to shake. When this did not stop Sammy’s mother called for an ambulance. By then his entire body began shaking and Sammy was unresponsive and looked dusky.  What is your differential diagnosis for Sammy’s presentation? Which diagnosis is most likely?          Meningitis.      Focal seizure.      Encephalitis, brain abscess, tumour.        How does the presentation of meningitis differ in an infant vs. an older child?          More non-specific findings, such as loss of appetite, and lethargy.      Will often have concomitant infections.        Additional Information  Exam findings: Temp 40.0°C, HR=100, RR=25 (irregular), BP 120/90, Wt=20kg.  Sammy is lethargic and difficult even for his mother to arouse. He looks pale and unwell. He seems bothered by the brightly lit examination room and keeps his neck rigid. He has positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs. His tympanic membranes are red and bulging. The pupils are reactive. His heart, lungs and abdomen are normal. His color is pink but his hands and feet are cool to touch. He moves all his extremities weakly but symmetrically. The deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally.  Why is Sammy’s neck stiff? What are Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs?          Due to inflammation of the meninges.      Kernig’s sign → straight leg raise causes pain due to stretching of the meninges.      Brudzinski’s sign → flexion of the head causes hip flexion to relieve stretching of the meninges.        What features of Sammy’s presentation are characteristic of meningitis? How else can this illness present?          Preceding signs of infection.      Lethargic, decreased LOC, photophobic, positive Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs.      In general, if there’s a meningitides infection, may have a meningococcal rash.      In younger patients,         What would you do next (and why)?          Empiric AbX.      Blood cultures, blood work.      CT to r/o cranial lesion.      If CT normal, then LP.                  Gram Stain.          Culture &amp; Sensitivity          WBC Count + Differential          Protein &amp; Glucose.                      When is an LP contraindicated?          Focal neuro signs.      Stuperous/comatose.      Bleeding disorder.      Infection at site of puncture.        Why would increased ICP warrant a CT scan before a lumbar puncture can be done?          To avoid the risk of herniation with loss of ICP with drawing out of CSF.        What are most common offending organisms of bacterial meningitis in an older child? Is this different from the most common offenders in infants?          In older children and adults, gram positives are more common. In younger children, gram negatives are more common.      More common in older child:                  Strep. pneumoniae          Neisseria Meningitidis                    More common in infants:                  E. coli          Strep. agalactiae (GBS) (GS +, but also possible)                      Additional Information  A stat CT scan of the brain is normal. The LP results are as follows:                    Value        Result        Normal Range                            Opening Pressure:        150 mm H2O        (50-180 mm H2O)                    WBC        4500/µL        (&lt; 4 / µL)                    Neutrophils        85%        (1-3%)                    RBC        2 / µL        (0-3 / µL)                    Glucose        2.1 mmol/L        (2.2-3.9 mmol/L)                    Protein        980 mg/L        (80-320 mg/L)              What do you conclude? Why?          He has meningitis.      From the GS, it’s most likely to be Strep. pneumoniae.        How will he be managed?          Systemic antibiotics (Ceftriaxone + Vancomycin).      Dexamethasone to reduce inflammation and reduce risk of deafness.      IV fluids.        What are the complications of meningitis in children?          Acute → Seizures, coma, death, SIADH.      Long-term → deafness, learning disabilities, hydrocephalus, paresis.        How can bacterial meningitis in children be prevented?          Immunizations -&gt; prevnar for pneumococcus, Hib for hemophilus, menjugate for meningococcus.      Prompt treatment even with low clinical suspicion.        Who is most at risk of bacterial meningitis?          Young children, unimmunized, non-breast fed (receive Abs from maternal milk).      Hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell anemia (spleen dysfunction).      Immunocompromised.      Case #3  Case Summary  You are called to assess a male newborn of 9 hr old who has not yet fed well and that thenurses have found to be extremely “floppy”.  Jose was born at 36 weeks gestation following a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios and concerns regarding decreased fetal movements. Labour required augmentation with oxytocin. Birth weight was 3.0 kg. Extra suctioning was needed and bag mask ventilation was provided for the first 2 minutes of life.  The nurses are concerned Jose’s poor suck and fatigue with feeding. They would like you to start an IV. Jose has had brief intermittent episodes of tachypnea.  Jose’s mother has had one prior miscarriage. She has not been working over the past few years. In the maternal family history there are several family members with cataracts. Mother’s sister has had several miscarriages.  Weakness = active.  Hypotonia = passive.  Hypotonic may not necessarily have weakness; patient with weakness also probably hypotonic.  Neonatal, 80% central, 20% peripheral. Here, more likely peripheral since deep tendon reflexes absent. Also facial muscle weakness (ptosis). Child seems alert (less likely to be central).  Central: dysmorphic features, axial hypotonia, etc.EMG for musclesNCS for nerves.Would you give IV fluids? If acutely dehydrated yes; otherwise NG tube.Progression; congenital form is more severe. Something that you’d pass on. Life expectancy is decreased.Motor delay, probably no cognitive delay; however for some reason the congenital form DOES have cognitive delay.What is the expected course for this child?Given the genetics of this disorder and the findings in this family, what other factors will need to be considered?- Feeding will be difficult due to swallowing weakness.- Feeding study; if suggestive of choking; g tube (ng tube only temporary).- Respiratory function is at risk; respiratory compromise. Increased risk of choking, aspiration pneumonia.- Other manifestations of myotonic dystrophy:	- Cataracts.	- Diabetes (T2DM).	- Males are infertile (testicular atrophy), can often be later in life if not congenital.	- Frontal baldness.	- Congenital form can also AV blockage.Prolonged hospitalization, infertility, cognitive f(x), etc.Autosomal dominant + risk of anticipation (increased risk of congenital myotonic dystrophy with other children).Reassure mother that it’s not her fault; avoid assigning blame.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/04/16/child-health-small-groups-floppy-infant.html"},

Most of talk was yesterday; just highlights today.The younger you are; the less specific the presentation.Headache, stiff neck, etc. may be missing in infants/toddlers.Hence: 1. Beware &lt;2 year old infants/toddlers.Oftentimes, babies will often have other intercurrent infections (eg. will have otitis media as well). Miss it; get sued, lose your license, bah.Non-specific presentation:1. Loss of appetite2. Lethargy3.

Important with HSV is that it’s treatable (Acyclovir). Single most important prognostic factor for outcome for HSV encephalitis = time to treat with Acyclovir. Hence start even with low degree of confidence.INVESTIGATIONS.LISTEN FROM HERE.If child has focal findings or papilledema, then do imaging first to make sure there is no structural risk of herniation – want to know if there is free communication of fluid between brain and spinal cord; the problem occurs when you create a pressure differential between brain and spinal cord; want CSF to equilibrate in pressure.If you mess up and ICP was high and you did an LP, leave needle in, and give a dose of mennitol quickly over 20 minutes; which will suck H20 out of brain; which will dehydrate brain and bring pressure down; give mannitol over 24 h until it’s safe to take needle out.If child still spiking fevers after 48 hours and neuro symptoms not returning to normal, then repeat LP.LP is rarely normal; if LP is normal, then the patient does NOT have meningitis.Side effects of LP: Low pressure headache; bed rest, fluids.Also traumatic tap (hit blood vessel on the way):	- To correct protein value: Subtract 1 mg protein /1000 rbcs.	- To correct wbcs, subtract 1 wbc/500-1000 rbcs.- Image only if focal neurological signs or stuperous/comatose.MEMORIZE THAT CHART FOR CSF FLUID EXAMINATION:Normal CSF: &lt;5 lympocytes, CSF glucose &gt;= 2/3 plasma conc. (so also gotta do blood glucose), protein &lt; 0.4YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THESE.Neonates have a DIFFERENT normal CSF.40-100 white cells. Predominantly monocytes and lympocytes. (no neutrophils, etc).Protein limit higher: &lt; 1.0 g/L.Acute bacterial meningitis = white count in THOUSANDS, almost all polymorphs. Protein up, glucose down.Partially treated bacterial meningitis (that kid with otitis media that you gave amox):- Here you’ll have attenuated findings; mix of polys and lymphs; glucose less low.Viral, protein N, except may go down if mumps.TREATMENT; copy these.Complications:Cerebral edema -&gt; decreased LOC.SIADH secretion -&gt; seizures.Mannitol can often reverse cerebral edema; significant improvements!Hydrocephalus; may be asymmetric if blockage only occurs on one side.Case ExamplesFROM FIRST PARAGRAPH; need to think of meningitis here; recall non-specific symptoms.DTRS = deep tendon reflexes symmetrical.Undiagnosed meningitis for at least 24 hours!!

	{"title": "Neurology &amp; Systemic Disease", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Integrate knowledge from cardiology, respirology, and nutrition into the assessment of neurological problems.  Using a systems approach, formulate appropriate differential diagnostic lists for loss of consciousness, dyspnea, and multifocal cerebral dysfunction.  Know the difference between syncope vs. seizure.  Know the neurological causes of dyspnea.  Be aware of neurological disorders caused by nutritional deficiencies.Case #1  Case Summary      A 54 year old male patient with presents to the emergency room with an episode of loss of consciousness.    He had been drying dishes and then said he wasn’t feeling well. His wife then saw him fall to the floor, have generalized stiffening of his muscles, and become unresponsive to her.    She called 911 and he was brought to ER.    On arrival, he was back to his normal self.    What is the differential for transient loss of consciousness?  With any neurological problem, a psychogenic cause is always on the differential, even if it’s not that common.          Syncope (hypotensive, cardiac).                  Cardiac causes → arrythmia, cardiac outflow obstruction (eg. aortic stenosis).          Hypotension → vasovagal episode, other cause of hypotension.                    Seizure.      Psychogenic seizure.      Rare causes (don’t need to know):                  TIA (transient ischemic attack)          Narcolepsy.          Acute increases in ICP (eg. acute hydrocephalus).                      Trauma is also a possibility, although there would be a precipitating history if that were the case.  Syncope vs. Seizure      Syncope can often seem very similar to seizure; differentiating factors are as follows:                               Syncope        Seizure                            Warning symptoms        Light headedness, nausea, palpitations        Aura possible but not necessary                    LOC        Sudden        Sudden                    Eyes        Open and may be deviated up        Open and may be deviated to one side                    Limb movements        None, tonic, or clonic movements        None, tonic, or clonic movements. May be asymmetrical                    Duration of LOC        10-60s        60s to multiple minutes                    Post ictal period        Brief disorientation for up to 5 minutes        Disorientation for several minutes up to several hours. May have Todd’s paresis                    Urinary incontinence        Rare        More common                    Tongue biting        None        Possible to lateral tongue              What are the most valuable differentiating features?          Asymmetry → a seizure will often have asymmetrical features due to a focal source; this isn’t the case with syncope.      Post-ictal period → a seizure will have a prolonged post-ictal period; a       Urinary incontinence → more common in seizure than syncope.      Tongue Biting → NOT seen with syncope, but possible with a seizure (to lateral tongue).        Evaluation of Syncope vs Seizure:          History.      Physical Examination.      Lab Investigations:                  EEG.          EKG, holter, echo → r/o cardiac causes.          Bloodwork → CBC, lytes.          Tilt table testing → test for orthostatic hypotension.          Occasionally Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (continuous EEG recording + video monitoring).                    Case #2  Case Summary      48 year old woman presents to her family doctor with progressive dyspnea over the last 2 months. There has been an occasional dry cough. The MD looks through her records and notes that she is otherwise healthy and is on no medications.    What are the broad categories of possibilities for her dyspnea?    What are general causes of dyspnea?          Cardiac → CHF, cardiac ischemia, cardiac outflow, etc.      Respiratory → asthma, COPD, etc.      Anemia      Neurological → due to weakness of the respiratory muscles. Rare relative to cardiac/resp/hematological problems.        ASDFKADF  Plexus, brain rule out because won’t cause dyspnea.      Rare central causes; ondine’s curse; loss of involuntary action of breathing.    Rest could theoretically cause respiratory muscle weakness.  Muscle = hereditary and inflammatory myopathies.  NMJ = myasthenia gravis.  Peripheral nerve = phrenic nerve palsy, GBS.  Root; multi-level cervivcal radiculopathy (C3,4,5).  Anterior horn cell: ALS; thoracic motor neurons often affected first (intercostal muscles)  Spinal cord:          High cervical myelopathy (above C3,4,5).      She complained of dyspnea which was more severe when she was lying down. She has taken to sleeping in a lazy boy chair so that she can be more upright. Milder SOB during the day.	- FROM THIS; ORTHOPNEA, sounds like CARDIAC CAUSE.• Denies: Ankle edema, chest pain, sputum production, extremity muscle weakness, diplopia, dysphagia• Exam: Normal cardiac exam, JVP normal, no peripheral edema, unremarkable chest auscultation, CN exam normal, muscle bulk and power normal, reflexes normal.• Diagnosis???Doesn’t sound like cardiac, or resp.What muscle does most of breathing when supine? Diaphragm (diaphragmatic paralysis).When upright, intercostals do more work.So this person had bilateral phrenic nerve palsy.TL;DR; RULE OUT CARDIAC/RESP/HEME causes, and only then consider neuro causes.• CXR to see if diaphragm moves.• Diaphragm fluoroscopy during inspiration/expiration• PFTs seated vs supine• Phrenic nerve conduction studies• Imaging of the neck and mediastinum -&gt; why is there phrenic nerve palsy (lesion, passes?)Case #3  Case Summary      9 year old girl choked on a pickle and developed a phobia of eating any foods. Despite parental encouragement, she would only drink coke, water or juice. Over the next several weeks, she started to stumble which her parents felt was related to her low calorie intake.    She was admitted to pediatrics for management of her weight loss and nutrition.    A NG feeding tube was placed on admission.    Within a day of the admission, she started to complain of diplopia. Her parents also stated she seemed confused.    On Examination:              Had difficult recounting a story that was just read to her.        Bilateral impairment of eye abduction, with nystagmus noted in adducting eyes        No nystagmus in primary position. Remainder of CN normal.        Power full throughout. Reflexes symmetrical and 2s throughout. Sensory exam normal.        Bilateral dysmetria with finger to nose testing and heel to shin testing. Severely ataxic gait.            Localization?- Bilateral 6th nerve palsy (brain stem or nerves going out) -&gt; ponto-medullary junction.- Dysmetria = bilateral cerebellar dysfunction.- Cognitive impairment!?!?!??!! How does this play into this? DOESN’T FITSince can’t be localized to a single part of the nervous system, this suggests generalized dysfunction with strong involvement of the pons.Dx: Wernicke’s Encephalopathy (Acute thiamine deficiency):Classic Triad:1.

Two days later his wife notices word finding difficulties (he is substituting incorrect sounds or words). She takes him to ER.    In ER he has a mild temp at 37.9, HR 108 and regular. HS normal.

Even though he’s had new acute events, his initial event was 2 days ago. Long clogged blood vessels are very leaky, and at high risk of hemorrhage.The blood vessels distal to the obstruction will be ischemic. SO if you break off the old clot, the new ischemic blood vessels are leaky, and prone to rupture.This is why there’s only a limited WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY for using thrombolysis for a stroke.Even if this is the first stroke, and within window of opportunity, still a risk if Pt. has endocarditis.Infection can travel up through blood vessels, can cause aneurysm, prone to rupture.Hence no anticoagulation for people with endocarditis; just treat their infection (Abx, ask cardiac surgery if need valve replacement).Management of Stroke Patients with Suspected EndocarditisBlood cultures x 2 (why ? sometimes 1st culture negative; infected valve may only throw off bac intermittently).Ask lab to keep culture for possible HASEK organisms (take longer to culture):	Hemophilis, aggregibacter, cardiobacterium, eikenella, kingella.Transthoracic +/- tranesophageal echo.Investigate for source of bacteria (particularlydental)• If blood cultures negative, strongly consider possibility of Non-bacterial endocarditis secondary to malignancy.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/04/16/neurology-systemic-disease.html"},
	{"title": "Approach to the Floppy Infant", "text": "Lecture Overview  Definitions and Overview.  Considerations in the clinical encounter.  Localization and classification.  Examples.Definitions and OverviewSome Definitions  Tone → the resistance to passive motion around a joint.          Phasic tone → muscle response to a rapid stretch. Mediated by the deep tendon reflexes.      Postural tone → muscle response to low intensity (gravity) forces.        Hypotonia → low muscle tone with a passive stretch around a joint.What is a ‘Floppy Infant’?  ‘Floppy’ Features:          Low muscle tone (hypotonia).      Weakness.      Ligamentous laxity and flexibility of the joint.            Ligamentous laxity can be seen in connective tissue disorders such as Ehler-Danlos syndrome and Marfans syndrome, and can often be mistaken for hypotonia.    Recall that reflex arcs are negatively inhibited by CNS; loss of CNS innervation then results in hyper-reflexia.  Infant physiology is different, in that some descending central mediation pathways in that infants have low muscle tone.      Even some of the biochemical systems (eg. GABA) can have paradoxical phenomena in children.    Floppy infant often non-neurologic, not neurological.          Non-neurologic causes are manifold, and include: electrolyte disturbances, sepsis/infection, dehydration, visual impairment, hypothyroidism, cardiac disease, failure to thrive.        Of the neurological causes, the majority are central; the minority are peripheral, and an exceedingly rare amount are a combination of the two.  WAIT, DOESN’T A CENTRAL PROBLEM RESULT IN INCREASED TONE AND HYPERREFLEXIA?          THIS IS UNIQUE TO INFANTS.      Low tone can be a more protracted manifestation of central problems.      2001 study from Montreal, list of causes of floppy infants in children.Central causes = 33.Peripheral = 17.Variety of different causes.2005 study, 89 children with floppy infant presentation.Dx could be established in 60.Most are central, were a few peripheral causes.Considerations in the clinical encounterClinical considerations:• History:– Pregnancy: decreased fetal movement, breech presentation, perinatal difficulties.– Other signs of central problems: cognitive/language delay, seizures– Feeding– Respiratory– Cardiac– Family historyBrain drives a lot of other vital functions.Look also for signs that help differentiate b/w central and periphral (eg. seizures, cognitive/language delay).Clinical considerationsThe Floppy Infant• Neurological physical exam:– General position: frog leg, decreased – Reflexes: directly strike muscle– Tone– Reduced muscle mass– Arthrogryposis– Normal sensation– Visual alertnessArthrogryposis.describes congenital joint contractures in two or more areas of the body.

This patient is both stuporous and has focal neurologic signs:          Hence, a lumbar puncture is CONTRAINDICATED, since you risk herniation.      However, you can’t do a CT scan to rule out a focal lesion, because there isn’t one nearby!        So what should you do?          Empiric antibiotic treatment (Ceftriaxone + Vancomycin) should be done right away.      This buys the patient more time, during which you can ship the patient to an area where there is a CT scanner.      In other words, empiric treatment, and then ship them out.

	{"title": "CNS Infections", "text": "Lecture Overview  First hour → lecture on the involved diseases.  Second hour → series of cases.Lecture Objectives  Given a history and physical examination, students should be able to make a diagnosis of the type of CNS infection present in the patient.  When asked, students should be able to outline a plan for managing suspected meningitis in the presence of altered sensorium and/or focal neurological findings.  When presented with the results of a CSF examination, the student should determine the type of meningitis afflicting the patient and the most common offending organisms.  Students should be able to write an antibiotic order for the empiric treatment of meningitis in the adult.  In a patient with herpes simplex encephalitis, students should list the antiviral therapy used.Infections of the Nervous System  There are 4 main types of CNS infections:          Bacterial → acute pyogenic meningitis, abscesses, etc.      Viral → meningitis, encephalitis, etc.      Fungal      Protozoal.        Of these, bacterial meningitis is the most important to recognize clinically.  Objective      Given a history and physical examination, students should be able to make a diagnosis of the type of CNS infection present in the patient.  Features of Meningitis in Adults  Fever, headache, altered mental status, photophobia.  Resisting neck flexion (stretches the meninges, causes pain).  Other signs of Meningitis (related to stretching of the meninges):          Kernig’s Sign → straight leg raise causes pain/discomfort of the neck. (mnemonic: K = knees).      Brudzinski’s Sign → neck flexion causes the patient to flex their hips.      These signs are less reliable in comatose or young patients.        Meningococcal rash (purpuric rash) → suggests septicemia and is pathognomonic of Neisseria Meningitides.Features of Meningitis in Infants &amp; Newborns  Fever, irritability and poor feeding.  Drowsiness.  Vomiting, convulsions.  Bulging fontanelle (late sign).  Meningococcal Rash.  Objective      When presented with the results of a CSF examination, the student should determine the type of meningitis afflicting the patient and the most common offending organisms.  Causes of Meningitis  Most common causes in children &amp; adults:          Strep. pneumoniae      Neisseria Meningitidis        Most common causes in neonates          E. coli      Strep. agalactiae (GBS)        Haemophilus influenzae used to be a common cause as well, but is now almost non-existent due to vaccination against it.  Listeria monocytogenes is also possible if the patient has other comorbidities:          Immunocompromised.      Elderly, alcoholic, DM.        S. aureus is also possible if recent head trauma/neurosurgical procedure (S. aureus is commonly found in the skin, so it can transmit via an open wound).  Objective      When asked, students should be able to outline a plan for managing suspected meningitis in the presence of altered sensorium and/or focal neurological findings.  Management of Meningitis  Tests that can be done for meningitis:          Blood culture → positive in 50% of patients with meningitis, because it often spreads via hematogenous spread.      Lumbar puncture → used to nail a diagnosis; ask for the following tests to be done on the LP: This is pretty similar to what you ask for with a joint aspiration with a suspected septic joint (recall, 3C’s and a G). Here, instead of asking for crystals, you ask for Protein + Glucose                  Gram Stain.          Culture &amp; Sensitivity          WBC Count + Differential          Protein &amp; Glucose.                      WARNING: Never perform a lumbar puncture on a patient that:          Is stuperous/comatose.      Has focal neurological deficits.        This is because these patients might have a space filling lesion, and a LP could result in cerebral herniation or DEATH:          Removal of CSF takes away some of the ‘padding’ around the brain; with less CSF keeping it afloat, it can sag.      If the brain already has a space filling lesion, then loss of this CSF could then result in herniation → bad!        Remember      NEVER perform a LP on a patient that is:              Stuperous/comatose.        Has focal neurologic deficits.              General Management Approach:          Perform blood cultures and start empiric antibiotics      Check for CNS focal signs or decreased LOC:                  If absent, do a lumbar puncture.          If present, an LP is contraindicated, so a CT scan should be done to r/o a mass lesion.                          If a CT doesn’t show a mass lesion, proceed with an LP.              If a CT does show a mass lesion, refer to neurosurgery.                                          With the results of the LP, you can then tailor your empiric antibiotics to the causative organism.      Approach to a Lumbar Puncture  As mentioned in MSK;   Objective      When presented with the results of a CSF examination, the student should determine the type of meningitis afflicting the patient and the most common offending organisms.  Spinous processes go a bit down, so you aim a little up.Dura is tough, so you feel a bit of a pop.Can check CSF levels in glass manometer; which directly reflects ICP; normally 10-20 cm of CSF; &gt; 20 suggests increased ICP.Decreased glucose pumped into CSF; glu down (not as much because bacteria eats it up).put table here.  Objective      Students should be able to write an antibiotic order for the empiric treatment of meningitis in the adult.  Adults: a) Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q4h (3rd Generation Cephalosporin)b) Vancomycin 2 g IV q12hVancomycin is a backup b/c a fair amount of pneuomococci can be resistant to ceftriaxone.Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin are also used empirically in infants and newborns, but in dosages based on weight.Inflammation can cause complications, so steroids can also be used acutely.Early treatment with dexamethasone: 10 mg IV with first dose of antibiotic and every 6 hours for four days• Significant reduction in morbidity and mortalityEspecially inflammation of 8th nerve -&gt; deafness.SystemicComplications–Hyponatremia, septic shock, adrenal insufficiency2) Meningealinflammationproducingcranial nerve palsies (especially CN 8 –sensorineural deafness) – more on this in Dr. Parnes’ sensorineural hearing loss lecture3) Meningealfibrosisandaqueductalstenosis – hydrocephalus (CSF pressure build up)Inflammation of blood vesselsInflammation of nerves (CN 8 most common for some reason).Meningeal fibrosis and aqueductal stenosis can result in reduced CSF exiting= hydrocephalus (both communicating or non-communicating); CSF pressure buildup.Secondaryvasculitis(inflammationof vessels) of both veins and arteries – infarction of brain tissue5) Cerebritis (inflammation of brain), abscess, and infarctions can all produce seizures6) Cerebraloedemacanresultinbrain herniation and deathBrain Abscess (a localized collection of puss buried in the brain)• May be due to a contiguous source of infection from the middle ear, mastoids, penetrating wound , but can also be hematogenous.Clinical Presentation: Headache, seizures, altered sensorium, and focal neurological deficitsCommon organisms: anaerobes, enterobacterial, streptococcus, and staphylococcusTreatment: Surgery plus antibioticsSame presentation; but since a focal lesion, can have focal findings.Example of a basilar skull fracture allowing bacterial organisms into the brain.Occipital lesion; L homonymous hemianopia.Acute frontal sinusitus -&gt; subdural empyema.

	{"title": "Clinical Neurology Small Group 2", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary  Juan is a 37 year‐old right‐handed man who presents to the neurology clinic after a series of unusual spells. He describes that suddenly he starts feeling nauseous, with a sensation of deja‐vu, and sometimes a feeling in his abdomen that rises up to his throat. Then he wakes up on the ground confused and is unable to communicate well with others. His roommate had witnessed 2 of these events and is able to describe that Juan looks pale, is unresponsive, and has prominent lip smacking and chewing movements. He also described repetitive movements of his left hand picking at his clothes. In one of those events, his roommate saw that Juan had a twisting movement of his right arm followed by turning of the head to the right and then jerking movements of his limbs. On that particular occasion, Juan lost control of his bladder.  He has had a total of 8 events over the last 4 months. Each event lasted approximately 40‐50 seconds, with the exception of one lasting 1 minute (the second one described by his roommate).  Juan’s past medical history is remarkable for a single simple febrile seizure at the age of 3, in the context of an episode of otitis media. His family history otherwise is unremarkable.  Juan’s neurological exam was normal.   What is the differential diagnosis of Juan’s spells?  What type of seizures is Juan experiencing? → 3 different types.          Several simple partial seizures.                  These are seen in his sudden spells of nausea + deja vu.          More specifically, these are auras; a sensory-specific subgroup of simple partial seizures.          Where you have a sensation rising from your abdomen to your throat, this is called an epigastric aura.                    Complex partial seizures                  Where he had a loss of consciousness, but his findings still seemed confined to one side (unilateral motor phenomena).          Unilateral motor phenomena include ‘twisting motions of his right arm’, and ‘turning of head to the right’.                      What is the localization of these seizures within the nervous system?          Key points to focus on:                  Possible post-ictal Wernicke’s aphasia.          Deja vu = meso-temporal lobe.          Repetitive motions of his left hand.          Twisting motion of his right arm.          Turning of the head to the right.                    These are suggestive of a L-sided temporal lobe problem, particularly the deeper regions.      Wernicke’s area is most commonly located on the L temporal lobe, but can often not help lateralization because the seizure can travel to the other side.      Earlier findings are better for localization, before it spreads.        Does he have epilepsy?          Epilepsy = &gt;2 unprovoked seizures.      So this is a L temporal lobe epilepsy.        What are the possible etiologies for his seizures?          UGHH.      Early febrile seizures = risk factor for future epileptic seizures.      Most likely etiology; mesial temporal lobe sclerosis.      Second most likely; tumours.        What test would you order next? And subsequently?          EEG to confirm the diagnosis.      MRI to determine if there is an anatomic cause (eg. sclerosis or tumour).      EEG for diagnosis and to aid localization.      MRI for etiology.      EEG -&gt; L temporal spikes.

No clear indications for surgery; really depends on the patient’s values.          Failure to respond to a few anti-epileptic drugs.          Significant functional issues.          2 failures of monotherapy or combination? Pharmaco-refractive after 2 anti-epileptic drugs.          Temporal lobe epilepsy are generally very refractory to medications; having surgery too late can lead to worsening of neurologic f(x) due to damage caused by epilepsy.

There had been some improvement over the next several hours, but when his partner Jack called home at 9:15 hrs, he noted that Ming’s speech was halting and limited – he called 911 immediately. Jack noted that Ming had been experiencing intermittent palpitations lately but no chest pain, shortness of breath or fainting.  Past Medical History: A two year history of mild essential hypertension. Medications: Hydrochlorothiazide. NKDA  Physical Examination  Ming was alert and rubbing the left side of his head. BP was 165/90 and the pulse 110 beats per min irregularly irregular. Afebrile. No carotid bruits. Chest was clear. Heart sounds were normal to ausculation without murmurs. Good peripheral pulses. The abdomen soft and benign. No cutaneous lesions were seen.  Ming was able to follow simple commands and appeared to comprehend conversational speech but his responses were effortful and limited to one-word answers. He appeared frustrated. He was unable to read aloud and could only write his name. On cranial nerve examination, his visual fields were full to threat. His pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light. He had full extraocular movements without nystagmus. He reacted to pinprick bilaterally. He had a mild right lower facial droop. His palate was midline and the tongue deviates slightly to the right. His muscle bulk was normal. He had reduced tone on the right. There was a right pronator drift. Strength testing was full on the left with very mild weakness of right shoulder abduction, elbow extension and finger extension. Right hand rapid alternating movements were slow. Lower extremity power was full bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes were present, perhaps slightly reduced in the right arm. The right toe was extensor and the left was flexor.  Distinguish between fluent and nonfluent aphasia.          Fluent aphasia → the patient will be able to speak, but will be nonsensical.                  Wernicke’s aphasia is a classic example, where the speech generating region of the brain is okay, but the speech recognition area is affected. Here, the patient is mechanically able to speak, but what they say won’t make sense.                    Nonfluent aphasia → the patient is unable to speak.                  Broca’s aphasia is a classic example, where the speech generating region of the brain is affected, but the speech recognition area is okay. Here, the patient will be able to understand commands, but will be unable to verbalize.                      Define pronator drift.          Pronator Drift → a finding where, when you put your hands out in front of you in supination, and close your eyes, one arm will drift down with pronation.      A positive finding suggests upper motor neuron problems, and is useful in patients where there is no apparent muscle weakness. Pronator drift will reveal more subtle situations where the short lasting phasic innervation is preserved, but the tonic innervation is affected.        Localize the lesion and discuss why.          L frontal lobe, around Broca’s area.        Discuss the differential diagnosis.          Stroke -&gt; ischemic or hemorrhagic.      Post-ictal stroke during sleep?      Migraines (unlikely since no previous history).        Discuss the presumed etiology of his clinical presentation.          Most likely to be a stroke; MCA      A-fib, increases risk of VTE, ischemic stroke.        Discuss the immediate management of this patient.          CT/MRI to DDx ischemic or hemorrhagic.      If ischemic, immediate tPA; within 4.5 hours of onset.      If hemorrhagic, stabilize vitals &amp; supportive Tx. BP control. No specific pharmacologic Tx; don’t administer pro-thrombotic factors; 2 studies haven’t shown improved clinical outcomes.      NEVER PRESCRIBE ANTI-THROMBOTIC DRUGS (even Aspirin) WITHOUT BRAIN IMAGING!!        Outline an approach to the investigation of this patient.          EKG -&gt; determine if A-fib, since suspicious P/E findings      Echocardiogram; look for anatomic causes of A-fib. CAD is common cause of A-fib.

Describe the common herniation syndromes.  Explain the components of the Glasgow Coma Scale.  Describe the mechanisms of head injury.  Describe the pathophysiology of head injury.  Describe the management of severe traumatic brain injury.Epidemiology of Traumatic Brain Injury  Fairly common → 20/100,000 head injuries per year.  Peak incidence: 15-24 y/o (young people).  Etiology:          Young → MVA.      Old → falls.        Mortality:  There is a worse mortality with a subdural hematoma because patients with subdural hematomas often have more severe comorbidities.          Epidural hematoma → 10-25%.      Subdural hematoma → 45-70%.      The Glasgow Coma Scale  Objective      Explain the components of the Glasgow Coma Scale.    Glasgow Coma Scale → an easy to determine, objective, reproducible, and predictive scoring algorithm to determine a patient’s level of consciousness.          There are 3 sections, and you get 1 point in each section just for showing up; hence, the lowest score you can get is 3.      The maximum possible score that you can get is 15.        The GCS is assessed as follows:          Eye Opening:                  Spontaneously → 4.          To speech → 3.          To pain → 2.          None → 1.                    Verbal Response:                  Orientated → 5.          Confused → 4.          Inappropriate (eg. swearing) → 3.          Incomprehensible → 2.          None → 1.                    Motor Response:                  Obeys commands → 6.          Localizes to pain → 5.          Withdraws from pain → 4.          Flexion to pain → 3.          Extension to pain → 2.

	{"title": "Facial Paralysis", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Outline an approach to a patient presenting with an acute facial paralysis.  Briefly discuss the differential diagnosis of acute facial nerve paralysis.Anatomy of the Facial Nerve  The facial nerve has a complex course and complex function:          Skeletal motor.      Visceral motor.      General sensory.      Special sensory.        What do you need to know?          Lot of different sections: copy from picture.      Important parts = tympanic -&gt; mastoid -&gt; stylomastoid foramen.      Endoneureum, perineureum, epineureum, recall MSK.      Recovery depends on degree of injury.        DON’T MEMORIZE THESE NUMBER’S  Biggest complication of ear surgery = facial paralysis.  Extratemporal:          Pes anserinus      To zanzibar by motor car.      Sunderland CLASSIFICATION- COPY FROM MSK.- Neuropraxia, axonotmesis, neuromesis = SEDON CLASSIFICATION.- Problem is that 2nd, 3rd and 4th = axonotmesis, poorer differentiation.- 3rd degree, since endoneureum damaged, can have cross-talk after regeneration (eg. smile with blink due to nerve crosstalk)	- SYNKINESIS = cross-talk b/w fibres.- 4th degree = perineureum.- 5th degree = epineureum disrupted; outside is damaged; no recovery unless nerve is repaired.COPY THIS PRETTY CHARTTopodiagnosis:Based on course of facial nerve.eg. can you tear? can you produce saliva on that side?Now we just do a CT scan, blehh.Testing the facial nerve.- Best way is via electroneuronography (ENoG); record compound action potential (CMAP) in facial muscles; compare good side to paralyzed side.- Test useful between 3 days and 3 weeks of paralysis.	- Why do you need to wait 3 days?	- You need 3 days for that nerve to degenerate out via Wallerian degeneration.	- Hence you need to wait those 3 d.	- Test too early, will look functional.- The only ‘relatively objective’ measure of facial nerve integrity.	- &gt;90% reduction in CMAP - 50% of patients with poor function.	- &lt;90% reduction in CMAP - excellent prognosis.- Test from stylomastoid foramen out to face.ENoG vs EMGEMG looks at muscles, ENoG looks at nerves.IGNORE EARLY TESTING BULLET.Fibrillations suggest denervation.Polyphasic potentials suggest recovery &amp; reinnervation, will be seen 6-12 weeks before nerve beginning to work again.Electrical silence = denervation + FIBROSIS and loss of motor endplates.	- Usually after 1-2 years; WORST POSSIBLE SIGN.Facial paralysis has a tons of causes; of which Bell’s palsy is the most common.Can think of etiology based on pathway of nerve. or types.MOST COMMON ETIOLOGIES ***Acute facial paralysis; LMN ONLY!!!!!!!!

	{"title": "Vertigo", "text": "Dizziness = layterm, encompasses vertigo, ataxia, lightheadedness, etc.Vertigo = illusion of movementLecture Objectives  Understand pathologic and physiology nystagmus.  Signs and symptoms of vestibular disorders.  Approach to ‘dizziness’.  Treatments for peripheral vertigo.  Describe BPPV, Menieres Disease, labyrinthitis, ototoxicity.Vestibular Physiology  The vestibular system takes 3 inputs:          Visual.      Vestibular.      Proprioceptive.        Processing then occurs in the cerebellum.  Output is to the extraocular muscles and flexors/extensors.  The vestibular system functions as ‘image stabilization’; it helps us keep the world seem balanced.Canal Orientation  Posterior canal on both sides is on the same plane as superior canal on other side?  So posterior canal on one side works with superior canal on other side.  Will be important later on for BPPV.  PARALLEL.  Base cilia?  Stereocilia?  Towards condrocilium = stimulation? Away = inhibition?Inside canal, direct fluid away from canal (ampullofugal canal) stimulates it?!Two canals work at same time; one is stimulated, one is inhibited; difference is what drives the VOR.  Nystagmus → a rhythmic back and forth movement of the eyes with a quick phase and a slow phase.          The direction of the nystagmus after the fast phase.      If you put cold or hot water in the ear, it actually generates a nystagmus (hot water = depolarization, cold water = hyperpolarization/inhibition).                  Horizontal canal closest to ear drum; so it’s what affected, in horizontal plane.                    So hot water on R side will increase ‘strength’ on R side vs L, drifts R-&gt;L, and then snaps back.      Since nystagmus named after FAST part, this is a R nystagmus.        Similarly, cold in L; R pushes harder, will drift left, then snap back.          Each eye tries to ‘push’ eye in opposite direction.        COWS (ENG/VNG Electronystagmography, Videonystagmography)          Cold opposite.      Warm same.

In utricle!?!?		- Lets say they go into horitontal canal; canal is tilted upwards, so will be pushed down.		- What about superior canal, has to go all the way up; very hard.		- Posterior canal = easier to get in, easy to fall all the way into the nadir of the vestibular system, difficult to get out.- DIAGNOSIS:	- Dix-Hallpike Maneuver	- Turn head 45 degrees in direction you want to Tx	- Doesn’t test both ears at same time.	- Lay head over edge of bed, will see classic nystagmus.	- Since posterior and superior canal are involved in rotatory nystagmus!!		- Will see rotatory nystagmus		- 5 things you see in Dix-Hallpike			1. Nothing at first (latency due to crystals moving into position)			2. Rotatory nystagmus (‘superior pole beating towards the ground’; hence L = CW, R = CCW)			3. Limited total duration; crystals settle.			4. Direction reversal on sitting (crystals fall back other way to inhibit canal); will get opposite.			5. Fatigue of response over time; crystals disperse, less able to stimulate canal.		- Watch videos of Dix-Hallpike.- TREATMENT:	- Reassurance; not a tumour, not a stroke.	- Habituation exercises in past.	- PARTICLE REPOSITIONING MANEUVER = GOLD STANDARD		- Some ppl call this the Epley maneuver.		- See the video! Really cool; idea is to get crystals out of the canal.			- Visualize in 3D!			- Ideal way to fix this would be to do a reverse somersault; someone actually came up with a fancy ass $$$ expensive machine to do this!!		- 33% recurrence rate over next year. But can learn maneuver on themselves.			- 80% treatable in single treatment session.			- 95% treatable in 3 sessions.	- Surgery in rare cases.		- Dr. Parnes who gave yesterday’s lecture invented this!Dizzyfix; only way to get ball through contraption is to do the Epley maneuver.Also an app for that.Same guy who made the hat made the app!BPPV SUMMARY  Most cases of BPPV arise from free-floating posterior canal endolymph particles.  Most can be cured by particle repositioning.  Persistent, recurrent or atypical cases are rare.  For intractable BPPV, posterior semicircular canal occlusion is a safe and effective proceudure.MENIERE’S DISEASEIn ear you have perilymph and endolymph?

	{"title": "Conductive Hearing Loss", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Diagnose a conductive hearing loss.  Create a differential diagnosis for conductive hearing loss.  Manage common ear disorders like acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion.Types of Hearing Loss  Conductive          Where air conduction &lt; bone conduction.      In other words, sound transmits better through the bone than through the outer and inner ear.      This is caused by any condition that prevents sound from transmitting from the outer ear to the inner ear.        Sensorineural          Where air conduction = bone conduction.      This is where the transmission of sound is okay, but there’s a problem with the inner ear or vestibulocochlear nerve.        Mixed          Partly conductive, partly sensorineural.      Some amount of air and bone conduction loss.      Outer earPinna = auricle.Idea is to funnel sound into the ear canal.Minimal role into sound transmission.Amplifies high frequency sounds.Assists in sound localization.Tympanic membrane.What do you see with an otoscopic exam?Here, you can see the handle of the malleus, as well as additional structures. Head of stapes, facial nerves.Stapedius = protective mechanism, dampens movement of stapes with loud sounds.Tensor tympani, goes to neck of malleus.Stapedius by facial nerve.Tensor tympani = trigeminal nerve.Impedance-Matching of the middle ear.In electronics, impedance matching is the practice of designing the input impedance of an electrical load or the output impedance of its corresponding signal source to maximize the power transfer or minimize signal reflection from the load.Sound vibrations have to move fluid in inner ear, create waves, 99.9% of sound energy reflected from air to fluid medium.P = F/AAugmenting the signal involves both.1. Difference in surface area of eardrum to stapes footplate (20:1)2. Lever action of the ossicles (1.3:1)Hearing assessment.May be as simple as a tuning fork.More precise with audiometer + sound booth (no ambient sound).Audiogram; measure threshold of hearing with both ear and bone conduction.Determine how much hearing loss there is, and what type of hearing loss there is.Decibels WRT to frequency plotted.Decibels = loudness, relative measurement of sound.0 decibels = threshold of hearing in normal ear.Range of human hearing is huge, so log scale.WEBER TESTW in weber, so point = middle, put on middle of head.Middle of head, push hard to get that bone conduction!Localization of sound to one ear suggests:	- Louder in ear with conductive loss.	- Louder away from ear with sensorineural loss.Weber test considerations The Weber test reflects conduction loss in the ipsilateral ear because, in the event of impaired conduction, ipsilateral sensorineural hearing is perceived as louder; this is the same reason humming becomes more salient when covering the ears.RINNE TESTPress firmly on head, so hard that you pull on other side of head.If you press lightly, will get false negative response (since bone conduction is attenuated).Press on hard bone (mastoid bone).Don’t wait until can’t hear, just ask which is louder!!! Waste of time!!!!If 1 (on bone) is louder, then it’s a conductive hearing loss!Low freq affected more than high freq; otosclerosis.Throughout frequencies, atresia of ear!?Surgery to recreate an ear canal is risky, facial nerve is closeby.Bone conductive hearing aid, vibrates bone depending on surrounding sound.BAHA = bone anchored hearing aid, this is anchored to the bone itself, to transmit vibrations through skull.More convenient than older versions, which had to be strapped on.Disorders of the External Auditory Canal:Outer third or inner 2/3s?Outer third, thick skin, adnexa (hair follicles, sebaceous glands, etc), cartilage.Medial 2/3s. = thin skin, no hair, bony, exquisitely sensitive.	- Outer ear doesn’t hurt much, inner ear super sensitive.	- Be mindful of this when doing otoscopic examination.Impacted cerumen (earwax).You need a COMPLETE impaction to have hearing loss.If you have a little space, can hear fine.Oftentimes, will be mostly occluded, and water in ear will fill this out completely.Family docs clean this out with syringe. Not a sterile procedure. Don’t use cold water (warmed).Try to squirt along roof, water goes around, and circulates back and washes out.This isn’t done in ENT clinic, they have fancier shit.Foreign bodies… stones, q-tips, etc.Don’t try to grab it, get a hook in behind it and pull it out.Bony protuberances of ear canalExostoses of the ear canal.‘surfer’s ear’, common in california.Chronic cold water in ear, triggers these little bony growths for some reason.Bacterial otitis externa (swimmer’s ear)Itchy, pain, swollen, sore on pulling pinna, reduced hearing, may have watery discharge.Reduced hearing if full of exudate.Most common offending organism is pseudomonas aeruginosae, staph is second.Tx; in environment, Syringe with vinegar for a few days, will kill if pseudomonas infection.Cipro, pseudomonas coverage, non ototoxic, especially if perforated tympanic membrane.Q-tips are dangerous, could obstruct, trauma, spread bacteria.• CIPRODEX® Ciprofloxacin &amp; dexamethasone If no perforation:GARASONE®SOFRACORT®CORTISPORIN®OtotoxicALL 3 HAVE AN AMINOGLYCOSIDE COMPONENT.DON’T USE THESE IF THERE’S A PERFORATIONBETTER NOT TO USE THEM.Mechanism of delivery, otowick, like a compressed sponge, will blow up when it gets wet, apply drops to lateral surface, will absorb and spread to the inner ear.Necrotizing otitis externa or malignant otitis externa= worst ear infection you could ever have.= osteomyelitis of skull base from ear.Could kill if left untreated.See granulation tissue at junction of bony and cartilaginous ear.Older diabetic, suspect!Fungal Otitis Externa:Often aspergillus (nigra) = black spores.Or candida (white mycelium).MIDDLE EAR CONDUCTIVE HEARING LOSSOtitis Media (mostcommon cause)• TM Perforation• Ossicular fixation– Otosclerosis• OssicularDisarticulation• CholesteatomaN = translucent middle ear.  Otitis Media          Epidemiology.                  Increasing incidence?          Increases after newborn period.          2/3 with AOM by one year of age.          1/2 with &gt; 3 episodes by 3 years.          Most common in 6-11 months.                    Can cause eardrum rupture.      Sudden onset of middle ear inflammation + &gt;1 of following:                  Pain, fever, irritability.                    Risk factors                  Day care          Second hand smoke.          Age of first infection.          Breast feeding thought to be protective.

Yellowish discoloration + air-fluid level often seen post-infection. Air-fluid = half cleared already.      COMPLICATIONS:                  Lots of complications: intratemporal, intracranial.          Intracranial complications often life-threatening.          These complications used to be common before w/o Abx, now rare.                      Acute Mastoiditis          Bulding + swelling behind ear.      CT scan shows destruction of bone.        Meningitis          MOST COMMON SERIOUS COMPLICATION of otitis media.      Majority of patients &lt; 1 y/o.      Acute otitis media:                  H influenzae.          Strep. pneumoniae.          IV Abx.          8% mortality.                    Chronic otitis media:                  Proteus          Klebsiella          Diphtheroids.          Surgery          30% mortality.                    Meningitis often causes hearing loss due to labyrinthitis (deafness due to inflammation of blood vessel feeding inner ear).                  Hence sensorineural hearing loss.                    3 most common organisms:      SAME FOR ALL ENT.                  Strep pneumoniae.          H. flu          M. catarrhalis.                    Previous studies have shown that the majorityof cases of acute otitis media will resolvewithout specific therapy• Antibiotic usage varies from 31 % in theNetherlands to 98% in the US and Australia- We’re more like the US.• Cannot predict who will develop a complication• Do not know organism without a myringotomyCPG guidelines, &lt; 6 years of age, immune system less robust.Even if uncertain (can’t see tympanic membrane)PASTE HERE  Tx Guidelines: Amoxicillin @ 40 mg/kg per day: for 10  days &lt; 2 years  for 7 days &gt; 2 yearsSecond-line agents:If no response to amoxicillin, complications, or recurrence.Suppurativecomplications• Acute symptomsdespite appropriateantibiotics &gt;6 wksOver 12 weeks, 90% will clear; few will have persistent effusion, will consider tubes (small tube in eardrum).Tube keeps hole patent (eardrum has a propensity to heal itself).Eventually the eardrum will push the tube out like a foreign body, will only last 6-12 months.Children have a shorter, smaller, flatter eustachian tube.OM + effusionpneumatic otoscopy, blows air into ear at same time.Bulbed tip helps seal air canal.Helps you see if tympanic membrane vibrates normally.If doesn’t, suspect fluid in middle ear, or perforation.Tympanogram; audiologists, measures movement of eardrum.Normal pattenStiff = otosclerosisHypermobile = ossicular disruption.Flat = fluid in middle ear/rupture.LISTEN TO THIS LATER.Heraing loss &gt; 30 months of with a 20 decibel or worse hearing threshold in the better ear, consider hearing tubes.Chronic negative middle ear pressure.Collapse of eardrum, over ossicular erosion.Will eventually progress into an cholesteatomas.Eardrum keeps sucking back, blocking desquamation of skin of middle ear.

Malleus = small hammer.2. Incus = anvil3. Stapes = stirrup.Malleus -&gt; Incus -&gt; stapes articulation.Base of stapes fits into oval window that = opening between middle and inner ear.Plugged up with base of stapes.So tympanic membrane moves b/c of sound -&gt; moves tympanic membrane -&gt; moves malleus -&gt; moves incus -&gt; moves stapes -&gt; pushes in and out of oval window into inner ear.This amplifies sound vibrations into inner ear.Lever system between bones amps up frequency ~1.3 x.Tympanic membrane = 17x size of oval window.Hence 1.3x17 = ~25 times amplification.This is necessary to get the inner ear fluid moving.Tiny bones, tiny muscles:Tensor tympani; attaches to malleus (1st in chain, which attaches to membrane); holds back the malleus to dampen sound waves.Stapedius, attaches to the stapes, and dampens wild movements of the stapes before it enters the oval window.It’s thought that these muscles not only dampen, but also help ‘tweak’ input to filter out ambient noise. Jury’s still out.What nerves innervate these muscles?- CN VII for Stapedius.- CN V for tensor tympani.- Malleus and incus innervated by trigeminal nerve.- Stapes by facial nerve.Why? Evolution.Jaw = first arch derivative; nerve to jaw = trigeminal.Ears are derivative from the jaw, (V3).Stapes is derived from lever system (second arch derivative in fish) = facial nerve.Malleus and Incus• Part of jaw• Innervated by CN V3Stapes• Part of structure thatworks on jaw• Innervated by CN VIITherefore:Tensor tympani – CN V3Stapedius – CN VIITympanic MembraneHealthy ear, can see handle of the malleus.Relationships of the middle ear.Connected posteriorly with the mastoid air cells.Anteriorly to pharynx with auditory tube.Consequence: INFECTIONS:	- Middle ear should be an air filled sac.	- Auditory tube normally closed, unless yawn/chewing.	- Hence, an infection easily seals it shut.	- Goes too far posteriorly, can get into mastoid air cells -&gt; mastoiditis.	- Infection of mastoid air cells.Auditory tube connects middle ear to nasopharynx.More horizontal in infants and children than adults.	Hence they’re more susceptible to ear infections.	Also when you sleep on your site; prevents drainage.Tube easily closes; prevents infection from escaping ear.OTITIS MEDIA; you feel like you’re underwater.- Infection of middle ear.- Infected fluid; sounds like you’re underwater.- Tympanic membrane = red and inflammed.- Tympanic membrane is the weakest part; escape for pressure.	- Can see bubbles, redness, inflammation on tympanic membrane.	- Can burst tympanic membrane; relief (pressure drains), can’t hear well for a few days.	- If this is a chronic problem (tubes put in ears), allows for drainage.	- Problem with tubes: hole, so when swimming, fluid can get into inner ear (hence you need earplugs).Facial nerve pathway:Crazy path through this region:Internal acoustic meatus -&gt; facial canal	Both sides = mastoid.	Goes medial to middle ear (between middle and inner ear), and then it goes posteriorly.	(RELATIONS OF MIDDLE EAR IMAGE): looking into medial wall; past which will go into inner ear. Then curves around to go posterior to middle ear.	So actual nerve loops around medial and posterior.Carries on, gives off some branches, goes through stylomastoid foramen; terminal branches of facial nerve.	Terminal branches mostly motor, innervate muscles of facial expression.	Not chewing muscles (trigeminal).	Go through parotid; 5 branches: (To zanzibar by motor car).	Parotid plexus.Branches within the facial canal:	Greater petrosal nerve	Nerve to stapedius	Chorda tympani nerveLISTEN TO THIS.Greater petrosal nerve -&gt; lacrimal gland in eye.Chorda tympani:	- Taste to anterior 2/3 of tongue.	- Submandibular and sublingual glands (parasympathetic).Bell’s palsy- idiopathic damage to facial nerve, leading to paralysis of the facial muscles.Lateral wall of middle ear.Tympanic membrane• Malleus – attached totympanic membrane andattached to incus• Incus – attached to stapes• Tensor tympani – insertson handle of malleus• Chorda tympani nerveCAN’T SEE STAPES, ATTACHES TO MEDIAL WALL.Why important to know that chorda tympani goes through middle ear?Ear infection can affect taste in anterior 2/3, or with salivation (submandibular, sublingual), on same side.Medial wall of middle earMostly bone. Bunch of bumps that protrude into middle ear.Promontory -&gt; overlies cochlea.Oval window, covered by stapes; transfers sound to cochlea.Round window, closed by membrane.Tympanic plexus, super confusing. Branch of glossopharyngeal nerve.One offshoot goes off to innervate parotid gland.In picture, above facial nerve, can see part of semicircular canal.INNER EARHearing + balance.Covered more in neuroanatomy.Cochlea = hearing apparatus.Vestibular system = balance + equilibrium.Bony labyrinth.Bony temporal bone (thickest part of skull), petrous part of temporal bone.Like a fossil cast. Surrounded by bone. Filled with perilymph.Inner ear, surrounded by bone, filled with perilymph.Real structure inside = membranous labyrinth.Like a balloon that a clown twists for you.Then filled with another fluid, the endolymph.Bony labyrinth -&gt; perilymph -&gt; membranous labyrinth -&gt; endolymph.Cochlea = snail like thing (hearing apparatus).The rest is the vestibular apparatus = 3 semi-circular canal.Round window, covered with membrane. Bows out to compensate for increased pressure from stapes.Basically, as stapes presses in, round window protrudes out into middle ear.SOUND CONDUCTIONSound wave enters external acoustic meatus and moves tympanic membrane• Energy transferred into vibration of the tympanic membrane• Vibration of tympanic membrane causes movement of malleus then incusthen stapes• Movement of stapes = movement of oval window that causes wave in perilymphwithin cochlea• Basilar membrane in cochlea vibrates and stimulates receptor cells in spiralorgan (of Corti)• Receptor cells conduct impulses to the brain through the cochlear division ofCN VIII, where the brain interprets the wave as soundFLuid moves differently depending on location on organ of corti.Topographic map, responds to different frequencies.Lets us differentiate between frequencies (labeled-line coding).How do you localize sound?

	{"title": "Ophthalmology Focal Problems", "text": "Glaucoma  Case Summary  An asymptomatic 68-year old male was referred to Ivey Eye Institute after a routine eye examination revealed optic nerve changes. His intraocular pressure was 28mmHg in the right eye, and 15mmHg in the left eye.  Glaucoma → optic nerve damage.  Incidence can be as high as 10% in the older population.  Can be classified into 2 categories:          Open-angle →      Closed-angle →        Describe what you see in the above photos          Difference in the cup:disc ratio (R &gt; L). The cup:disc ratio on the R is greater than the left.      If they were both the same as in the R eye, and the pressures weren’t elevated, then this may just be a normal variant (they were born that way).      Normal intraocular pressure = 21; &gt; 21 is suspicious.        What is the most likely diagnosis?          Enlarged cup:disc ratio combined with an increased R intraocular pressure suggests glaucoma.      More specifically, this is suggestive of open angle glaucoma.      Look at the angle and make sure that it’s open, to verify the diagnosis.        What constitutes a ‘suspicious’ appearing optic nerve  What constitutes an elevated intraocular pressure?  What are the main risk factors for this condition?          Age; older age increases risk.      Family history of glaucoma.      Race; Africans have an increased risk.      Thin corneas.        List 3 classes of medications that reduce intraocular pressure and their mechanism of action          Prostaglandin analogues → increased outflow.      Beta blockers → decreased production.      α-2 agonists → both increased outflow and decreased production.      (Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) → decreased production.        What are the main systemic side effects of these medications?          Beta blockers → bronchospasm in asthmatics, reduced HR.      α-2 agonists → can cause apnea in children.      Strabismus  Case Summary      A 3-year-old child was noted to have an in-turning eye for the past several months. It was intermittent at first, but is now constant.    Strabismus  Corneal light reflex. Hirschberg reflex.  Often have wide inter-canthal bridge.  Children do not fix and follow until 3 months of age.  What is the medical term for an ‘in-turning eye’? An ‘out-turning’ eye?          Esotropia → in-turning eye.      Exotropia → out-turning eye.        What are relevant questions that should be asked on history?          Duration of symptoms, OPQRST.      Is the in/out-turning constant or intermittent?      Trauma → eg. forceps delivery at birth.      Prematurity.      Developmental milestones (assess neurological development).        What is the danger of preferential fixation with one eye?          Amblyopia → where the visual cortex doesn’t develop properly on the side that receives input from the affected eye (sensitive period).        What physical sign is visible in the photograph?          Esotropia → in-turning of the L eye.        What tests can a family doctor do in their office if they are concerned about strabismus?          Corneal light reflex.      Cover test (cover the good eye, and see if the bad eye can fixate).        When should a child with strabismus be referred to an ophthalmologist?          ASAP; you don’t want amblyopia to develop!        What are the treatment options for strabismus?          Occlusion (patching) → cover the good eye.      Glasses → if accomodative (LOOK UP).      Surgery → if more conservative options fail.      Chronic Visual Loss  Case Summary      A 60 year-old male complains of a progressive decline in vision in his right eye over the last 6 months.    What is responsible for this patient’s visual loss?          Cataracts → there’s whiteness over the pupil.        What are the early symptoms of this ocular condition?          Blurry vision.      Poor night driving. Starbursts or halos may be seen.        What part of the eye is affected by this condition?          The lens (it gets cloudy).        What are some risk factors for this ocular condition?          Age      Steroid use.      Diabetes.      Radiation exposure (the lens is particularly susceptible to radiation due to high cell turnover).      Trauma, inflammation.        How can this patient’s vision be improved?          Lens replacement → cataract surgery.        Name some other causes of painless progressive loss of vision          Diabetic retinopathy.      Glaucoma.      Optic nerve compression.      Retina  Describe what you see in the photo.          Hemorrhage → in the centre of the image.      Drusen → yellow flecks on the surface of the retina. Drusen are made up of lipids, a fatty protein. Drusen are often a normal clinical finding with age, and do not necessarily suggest macular degeneration.      Vessel changes → more narrow and tortuous.         What is the most likely diagnosis?          AMD -&gt; Advanced Macular Degeneration.        What testing can a family physician perform to help determine the diagnosis?          Amsler grid. Grid of squares, tell if looks distorted or not.      If not Amsler grid present, use any straight line.      Distortion because new growth of blood vessels causes distortion of placement of retinal cells.        What are the two major forms of this eye condition? Which form is more common?          Wet/Neovascular      Dry/degenerative -&gt; more common (80%)        How is this eye condition treated?          Dry, no effective treatment, aim to slow down progression (vitamins).

Cornea – The Red Eye  Case Summary      A 23-year-old female presents with a 5-day history of a red, irritated, and painful eye. She complains that her vision has declined significantly in the affected eye. She is a soft contact lens wearer.    Describe what you see in the photo.          Ciliary flush; redness around cornea; suggests inflammation.      Whiteness on cornea.        What are the red flags on history that suggest a worrisome pathology?          Soft contact lens wearing.      Vision decline.      Acute progression.        What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Medial = spinocerebellum = vermis (midline) + intermediate cerebellum (lateral to vermis).  Lateral = cerebrocerebellum = lateral cerebellum.  Vestibulocerebellum = flocculonodular lobe.          Tucked underneath the other lobules of the brain, like the insular cortex.      Important functions in eye movements, balance, equilibrium.      Structurally similar, differ in IO.      Basic Circuit.The basic circuit is the same in the cerebellum.3 parts:  Direct path = sensory input -&gt; motor output.  Indirect side-loop:          Mossy fibre side loop.      Purkinje cell, major output of cerebellum.      For motor learning, this is the ‘student’; what has to be       Parallel fibre to purkinje cell connection IMPORTANT.      One purkinje cell receives lots of parallel fibres.                  WEAK SIGNAL, but connects from many.                      Climbing Fibre input.          To the purkinge cell.      This is the error detection signal.      Circuit used for learning what needs correcting (the teacher).      Purkinje cell only gets input from ONE CLIMBING FIBRE.      Hence, each purkinje cell gets weak input from multiple mossy fibres, and strong input only one climbing fibre.MOSSY FIBRE INPUT = WEAK BUT BROAD.CLIMBING FIBRE INPUT = STRONG BUT PRECISE      Purkinje cells INHIBIT the deep cerebellar nuceli. Only output from the cerebellum.FUNCTION OF THE 3 FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF THE CEREBELLUM:  Vestibulocerebellum = flocculonodular lobe.          Input: vestibular organs (inner ear).      Output: vestibular nuclei to eye, limb, and trunk (help maintain balance).      Function: tunes balance (stance and gait), and the vestibulo-ocular reflex.      Damage: balance problems:                  Ataxic gait (wide-based, looks drunk, poor sense of balance)          Romberg sign (imbalance worsens if eyes closed).          Nystagmus.                      Spinocerebellum          Input: Vision, audtion, seomatosensory and muscle afferents =&gt; LOTS.      Output: TO THE SPINAL CORD via the fastigial nucleus (vermis).      Function: Tunes and adjusts ongoing movements and muscle tone.      Damage:                   Ataxic gait due to poor control of muscle problems (unlike before, where ataxia due to balance issue).          ‘Drunk-driver test’ -&gt; falls when walking heel to toe.          Hypotonia -&gt; low muscle tone.                      Cerebrocerebellum          Input: From cerebral cortex, relaying a copy of the motor command sent to the spinal cord.      Output: Via the dentate nucleus to the motor and premotor cortex.      Function: add skill and coordination to movements.      Damage:                   Ataxia during skilled movement.          Dysmetria (inaccurate movement) and dysynergia (poor coordination).          Intention tremors -&gt; tremor right at end of motion.          Fails the finger to nose test.                    Cerebrocerebellar deficits present IPSILATERALLY; contrast to most problems which affect contralateral side.      EXAMPLE OF CEREBELLAR FUNCTIONVOR = vestibulo-ocular reflex, helps keep your eyes fixated on same place when your head moves.Gain of VOR = 1 if appropriately tuned.If motion of visual world on retina, then inappropriately tuned.Inappropriate tuning (retinal slip) results in a STRONG error signal from the climbing fibre, in addition to the signals from the mossy fibres that show what was done (student).Adujst strength at which parallel fibres talk to purkinje cells to modulate the response.Meniere’s Disease.Something wrong with fluid of inner ear.Affects vestibular afferents.1. At disease onset, produces a VOR imbalance, which results in nystagmus.2. Cerebellar response rebalances VOR to cause nystagmus to subside.3. As Meniere’s resolves, your VOR is now tuned to the pathological condition.4. Now you have nystagmus in the opposite direction.5. Nystagmus eventually disappears once the cerebellum restores the proper VOR gain again.(find cool eye animations!)Prism experiments.Put on googles which shift visual world.Goggles put mismatch in visual world.Body rapidly corrects within a few throws.When prisms removed, then have deviation in the opposite direction because we’re now tuned to the pathological condition.In patients with cerebellar lesions, they CANNOT ADAPT TO THE PRISM.The cerebellum acts like a repair shopIt learns to adapt to new tasks, and learn new motor skillsMotor disorders produced by lesions outside the cerebellum are quickly masked by this repair shopCerebellar lesions produce more long‐lasting disorders because the repair shop is itself damagedNeurophysiology of the Basal GangliaThe basal ganglia releaseappropriate movements andsuppress inappropriatemovements from premotor andmotor areasDamage to the basal ganglia is inpart responsible for Tourette’ssyndrome, which causes therelease of inappropriateutterances.TIC LIKE BEHAVIOURS.Focus on motor control here, but also plays a role in many other things, including emotion.Basal ganglia = caudate nucleus + putamen + globus pallidus + amygdala.Striatum = caudate + putamen.Substantia nigra pars reticulata projects to the superior colliculus for control of eye movements.Substantia nigra pars compacta = critical in parkinsons.Subthalamic nucleus = balancing output of basal ganglia.Striatum receives dopaminergic innervation from SUBSTANTIA NIGRA (PARS COMPACTAA).At rest, tonic inhibition from basal ganglia.WHen you want to move, inhibition of inhibitory stimulation from basal ganglia -&gt; permissive.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/24/neurophysiology-cerebellum-basal-ganglia.html"},

	{"title": "Descending Motor Pathways", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Name and describe the function of the major motor pathways through the brain to the spinal cord.  Understand the overview of motor control at all levels of the neuraxis.Spinal ReflexesMotor Neurons  Command from brain to spinal cord, what does it act on?  Synapse on lower motor neurons.  There are 2 of them:          alpha motor neuron, primary one that goes to extrafusal muscle fibres (standard skeletal muscle).      gamma motor neuron, goes to intrafusal muscle fibres (this has FEEDBACK through the 1a afferents to the alpha motor neurons). Gives info on dynamic state of muscle.      Intrafusal muscle fibers are skeletal muscle fibers that serve as specialized sensory organs (proprioceptors) that detect the amount and rate of change in length of a muscle.         Look at 2 reflexes  1 Stretch  2 Flexor withdrawal reflexes.Stretch Reflexes  Intrinsic spinal cord reflexes:          eg. tapping patellar tendon.      1a fibre afferent to spinal cord, causes excitation of alpha motor neuron, going out to the synergistic muscle. eg. knee extensors (quads).                  Monosynaptic reflex (1 synapse involved in this stretch reflex).          Can ALSO have interneuron involved, which inhibits the antagonistic muscle.          ALWAYS PRESENT AT LEVEL OF SPINAL CORD.          Always gets activated, but is suppressed by descending commands from spinal cord, which are much stronger inputs to the alpha motor neurons.                    With a CNS injury (no central command), these reflexes become more dominant. THIS IS WHY YOU GET INCREASED REFLEXES WITH A CNS PROBLEM.      Process of cephalization (control by higher brain).        Autonomic dysreflexia -&gt; extreme sympathetic response to minor stimuli. Often seen with spinal cord injury, can be medical emergency.  A lower motor neuron lesion causes flaccid paralysis, loss of stretch reflex, and atrophy          Since both require the efferent to be functional.      The stretch reflex (myotatic reflex) is a muscle contraction in response to stretching within the muscle. It is a monosynaptic reflex which provides automatic regulation of skeletal muscle length.When a muscle lengthens, the muscle spindle is stretched and its nerve activity increases. This increases alpha motor neuron activity, causing the muscle fibers to contract and thus resist the stretching. A secondary set of neurons also causes the opposing muscle to relax. The reflex functions to maintain the muscle at a constant length.FLEXOR WITHDRAWAL REFLEXThe withdrawal reflex (nociceptive or flexor withdrawal reflex) is a spinal reflex intended to protect the body from damaging stimuli.[1] It is polysynaptic, causing stimulation of sensory, association, and motor neurons.[1]eg. touching hot object.A nociceptor is a receptor of a sensory neuron (nerve cell) that responds to potentially damaging stimuli by sending signals to the spinal cord and brain. This process, called nociception, usually causes the perception of pain.Painful (nociceptive) input comes into marginal zone of dorsal horn.Through a series of interneurons, cause a response that causes avoidance of the painful input.eg. pulling hand away from hot object.eg. excitation of flexors, inhibition of extensors.A strong enough stimulus can also radiate to the other side of the spinal cord and have the opposite effect.Makes sense sometimes; if you withdraw your foot on one side, it’d make sense to extend your other foot. Compensatory effect.DOESN’T REQUIRE THE BRAIN, although it can get involved (eg. to suppress it, walking on hot coals).The motor unit comprises a group of extrafusal muscle fibers and the alpha motorneuron that innervates them. The alpha motor neurons in the ventral horn of thespinal cord terminate on the extrafusal muscle fibres for muscle contraction. Gamma motor neurons terminate on the intrafusal fibres of the muscle spindleand control the length and tension of the spindle which determines the frequency offiring of the sensory fibres from the muscle spindle and participate in the spinalstretch reflex. The stretch reflex involves activation of 1a afferents by stretch of a muscle spindle.The 1a sensory nerve has an excitatory synapse with the alpha motor neuron of thesynergist alpha motor neuron to cause muscle contraction. This is a known as amonosynaptic reflex. CAN HAVE DISYNAPTIC WITH INHIBITION OF ANTAGONIST. The 1a afferents can also lead to activation of interneurons with inhibition of themotor neuron to antagonist muscles resulting in relaxation of the antagonistmuscles to facilitate the monosynaptic reflex. A lower motor neuron lesion causes flaccid paralysis, loss of stretch reflex, andatrophy. The flexor withdrawal reflex involves activation of nociceptive sensory fibresleading to excitatory output to ipsilateral flexor muscles and inhibition of theextensors. The opposite can occur in the contralateral limb. This reflex involves largenumbers of interneurons. DESCENDING MOTOR PATHWAYS.CORTICOSPINAL PATHWAY- Corticospinal tract, carries information from motor cortex to spinal cord.	- PMC -&gt; Internal capsule -&gt; midbrain (cerebral peduncles) -&gt; pons -&gt; medulla (pyramids) -&gt; corticospinal tracts.	- Recall decussation at pyramidal decussation.		- 85% cross at pyramidal decussation, to become the LATERAL CORTICOSPINAL TRACT, contralateral info from cortex.		- 15% don’t cross, to become the ANTERIOR CORTICOSPINAL TRACT, ipsilateral info from cortex.	- Recall cerebral peduncles contain:		1. Cerebrospinal tract.		2. Corticopontocerebellar pathway, doesn’t go past pons, turns into cerebellum.- Most axons in the corticospinal tract decussate (cross).TERMINATION.LATERAL CORTICOSPINAL TRACT- A lot terminate directly at lower motor neurons, thought to be for more precise movements.- Others go through interneurons.ANTERIOR CORTICOSPINAL TRACT- Here, MOST these will cross at the level of the spinal cord, vs. the pyramidal decussation, to get to the contralateral side.- Very few will stay on the ipsilateral side to innervate motor neurons.- IGNORE ALL THIS SHITTTT.Corrollary:Any spinal cord damage between decussation and termination will cause mainly ipsilateral weakness.Any damage above the pyramidal decussation will cause mainly contralateral weakness.WHY DOES AN UMN NOT CAUSE FLACCID PARALYSIS?- Reflex pathway (just a loop through the spinal cord) maintained, so you still have some output to the muscles. Prevents atrophy too.- Clinically, spasticity results from the loss of inhibition of motor neurons by CNS, causing excessive muscle contraction. Unopposed spinal reflexes.CORTICOBULBAR PATHWAYCorticobulbar tractLike corticospinal tract.Except only to motor cranial nuclei, except for III.Difference is that most of your face movements are bilateral.These distribute to both the ipsilateral and contralateral cranial nuclei, unlike the corticospinal tract, which mainly distributes to the contralateral nuclei.Exception: lower facial muscles of 7 contralateral only, EXCEPT FOR FOREHEAD, hehehe	- This is why lower facial muscle palsy is a common finding with strokes.	- RECALL THAT THIS =/= BELL’S PALSY because the forehead is supplied by both hemispheres	- CNS = forehead spared.	- Hence a UMN problem that affects one side of the corticobulbar tract will cause drooping of the lower facial muscles on the opposite side, but will spare the forehead.	- A facial nerve problem (Bell’s palsy) will affect the entire IPSILATERAL side.RETICULOSPINAL PATHWAY- More diffuse system, more responsible for muscle tone on a second to second basis.- Not somatopically organized like the corticospinal tract (primary motor cortex).- Multiple sensory inputs, go into system, to affect tone.- RETICULAR FORMATION throughout brainstem.- Not called nuclei, located in brainstem where lots of fibres passing through; doesn’t have a compact nuclear formation. Diffuse neuronal bodies.- Don’t need to know all these interconnections.- Pontine reticular = ipsilateral, medullary reticular = bilateral.- To ventral horn of spinal cord, but never directly to alpha motor neuron.	- Since doesn’t require precise, fine movement.	- Always through interneuron.LATERAL VESTIBULOSPINAL PATHWAY- Balance.- CN VIII input goes into lateral vestibular nucleus.- Sends output down to spinal cord, excitatory to extensor muscles.- Makes sure that there’s always tone in extensors appropriate to what you’re doing.- Prevents you from falling over, keeps you balanced.  Lot of input from higher levels (cerebellar, etc).  Removal of higher inputs to lateral vesetibular nucleus, end up with rigidity in limbs due to excessive extensor excitation.          Decereberate rigidity.IPSILATERAL       The vestibulospinal pathway sends commands for muscle tone andactivation of extensor muscles of the trunk and limb to maintain balance. Neurons are located in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pathway descends ipsilaterally to the ventral horn of the spinal cordand terminates on interneurons that synapse with motor neuronsinnervating extensor muscles. The vestibular nucleus receives considerable modulation from higher braincentres as well as substantial input from the cerebellum. A lesion above the lateral vestibular nucleus results in a continuous state ofcontraction of the extensor muscles of the limbs, a condition known asdecerebrate rigidity. SUMMARY OF MOTOR CONTROLRegulatory loops.- Basal ganglia regulation -&gt; initation and tuning of motor actions.- Cerebellum -&gt; smoothing and coordination of muscle movements.- Cerebral cortex = contralateral.- Cerebellum = ipsilateral.- Recall spinocerebellar afferents (proprioception), go up to ipsilateral cerebellum.picture!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/23/descending-motor-pathways.html"},

A sensorimotor hierarchy within the cerebral cortex.          eg. progression from optic nerve -&gt; thalamus -&gt; primary sensory cortex.      eg. progression down.      In rats, the primary motor and sensory areas occupy nearly ALL of the cortex.      In humans, this is only a small part of the cortex.        Higher order:          Premotor (blue)      Higher order sensory areas (somatosensory association cortex, visual association cortex, etc), make sense of the visual information.      eg. V2, V3, dorsal and ventral streams of extra striate cortex.        PURPLE = assocation areas.          Takes up 80% of the cortex in humans.      This is where:                  Information from different sensory modalities is integrated.          Attention is shifted.          Planning occurs and decisions are made.          Things are remembered.                    Multisensory integration (PMAA), multiple sensations are integrated into a single perception of what’s going on.        PREFRONTAL CORTEX.  With evolution, the prefrontal cortex has become larger as a percentage of total brain size.  FUNCTIONS of the PREFRONTAL CORTEX:           SPATIAL WORKING MEMORY.                  eg. the cups game, where you hide a rock in one, and you have to remember which one it is.          Very young children, or patients with prefrontal lesions, have deficits in this task.          Can’t remember where you put keys, or where things are placed in space.                    RULE BASED BEHAVIOUR.                  Remembering and implementing rules (eg. red = stop, green = go).          Key to higher-order, context-dependent behaviour.          The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task is a common test of a patient’s ability to use rules to guide behaviour. Patients with lesions in the prefrontal cortex are deficient in this task.          Pretty cool; sort by colour, sort by shape, sort by number.                    DECISION MAKING.                  Making decisions, assessing outcomes of decisions.          After pre-frontal lesions, patients displayed no anger after mistakes.          Because of this calming effect, frontal lobotomies used to be used as a popular cure for aggression.          Unfortunately, it also destroyed their ability to make decisions and to have initiative. (neat).

MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION                   Right side: the spatial location of objects by touch, sight, or sound          Left side: the sounds of words, written words (sight) or Braille (touch)          Recall that you are left/right dominant depending on the location of wernicke’s area in the R/L area respectively. Most people are right dominant (language interpretation on L side).          R more spatially oriented usually; L more language oriented.                    ATTENTION                  The parietal cortex enables us to focus on some objects and neglect others.          Allows us to filter out some sensory information to focus on others.          Patients with parietal strokes OFTEN HAVE ATTENTION DEFICITS.                    MEMORY                  The inferior temporal lobe is involved in long‐term memory. We will look at this shortly.                      Can you spot what changes in this picture?          The ‘spotlight’ of attention.      Bunch of information comes in, can’t perceive everything. = change blindness.      Instead, we only perceive what we pay attention to, and in a complex scene, we cannot attend to everything at once. Our attention moves around like a spotlight to different parts of the scene.      At best, we can only attend to 3-5 objects at once.        INATTENTION BLINDNESS          A related phenomenon is called inattention blindness      For example, researchers questioned students who were talking on their cell phones while walking past a unicycling clown      They were twice as likely to not notice the clown as those not using cell phone      Inattention causes neglect!      NEGLECT = the converse of attention.One of the most common findings with a parietal stroke, affecting the PTO area (parietal-temporal-occipital area).A lesion of the right parietal cortex causespatients to neglect the left half of objects,regardless of where an object appears relativeto the line of sight (this is not a visual fielddeficit, as would happen after a right V1 lesion)Patients will also neglect their own body, forexample only shaving the right side of theirface, or dressing only the right side of theirbodyNEGLECT THE LEFT HALF OF THINGS, not because of sensory or motor deficits.See recovery over 1.5 months, but still problems on L side..Lesion on R side will cause L neglect, but NOT VICE VERSANeglect is lateralized.Common after R parietal strokes, but not L parietal strokes.Lesions of the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) cause neglect of the left sideof objectsSurprisingly, lesions of the left PPC do not cause neglect of the right side ofobjects. Why is this?Imaging experiments show that brain activity is distributed bilaterally to both PPCwhen attention is deployed to the right, but distributed unilaterally in the right PPCwhen attention is deployed to the left.The right PPC can deploy attention to the right or left of objectsLATERALIZATIONMany higher brain functions are lateralized to one hemisphere or another. Ourassociation cortices are not simply mirror images of each other“Dominant” hemisphere(usually the left) is moreimportant for sequential orserial tasks1) Language production andcomprehension2) Analytical math (e.g., A =B; B = C; thus A = C)“Non‐dominant” hemisphere(usually the right) is moreimportant for tasks requiringparallel processing:1) Spatial tasks and geometry2) MusicThe two hemispheres communicatethrough the corpus callosumSplit brain patientsCorpus callosum section -&gt; to prevent seizures in one side of brain from getting to other side.Imagine such a patient is shown an apple on theleft. This image is projected to the right cortex.The person can visually recognize the apple,and pick it out from other objects with the leftarm (since this is controlled by the right side ofthe brain)However, the person cannot name the applebecause it is not seen by the language center inthe left brainAlmost like two independent brains operatingin the same personSPLIT BRAINED!Myth: A common idea in popular culture is that “right‐brained” individuals aremore creative, and “left‐brained” individuals are more analyticalkernel of truth, hemispheres are lateralized, but not like this.Reality: The hemispheres operate together. In healthy people, the corpuscallosum ensures communication during the vast majority of tasks. As anexample, even though the left hemisphere is dominant for language, the righthemisphere is involved in processing intonation and emphasis. It’s not so simpleLanguage is the PROTOTYPICAL lateralized function.MemoryMemory: information that is stored (e.g., the memory of your grandmother), orthe structure that stores this information (e.g., synaptic strength in a particularpart of the brain)MemoryShort‐term/working memory Long‐term memoryReflexive/procedural DeclarativeLearning: the storage process that creates memories (e.g., how synaptic strengthis changed)Remembering: the retrieval of stored informationDifferent types of memory have different biological substrates.How is memory stored?How is memory retrieved?Reflexive/procedural = implicit.Declarative = explicit.SHORT TERM/WORKING MEMORY.‘scratch pad’ for temporary information storage.	storing numbers when adding	• storing words that one reads to form a	meaningful sentence	• Remembering the spatial location of objects	(e.g., pointing to remembered objects when	your eyes are closed)Requires PERSISTENT TONIC ACTIVITY in the FRONTAL LOBE (prefrontal cortex).

	{"title": "Ascending Sensory Pathways", "text": "Lecture Objectives  This lecture should integrate the material we’ve seen in previous lectures.  Name and describe the pathways for transmission of sensory information from the periphery to the termination in the spinal cord and brain.  Describe the sensory deficits due to lesions in the spinal cord, brain stem, diencephalon and cerebrum.Introduction  There are three main ascending sensory pathways in the spinal cord:          Dorsal Column, aka. the Medial Lemniscus Sensory System.      Spinothalamic and Spinoreticular Pathways.      Spinocerebellar Pathways.        Here, we’ll be focusing on the sensory innervation of the body; the sensory innervation to the head involves the cranial nerves, and not the spinal cord.Dorsal Column Pathway  Dorsal column → also known as the medial lemniscus.  The dorsal column contains fibres for the following sensory modalities:          Pressure      Discriminative touch (aka fine touch, conscious touch).      Vibration sense      Proprioception        The dorsal column does not cross at the level of the spinal cord.          This is an important differentiating feature from the spinothalamic tract.      Ascending nerves enter the dorsal funiculus without synapsing, and then enter the spinal cord.      The location at which there’s the first synapse is an important differentiating feature between ascending pathways:                  The medial meniscal system doesn’t synapse in the spinal cord; it just turns and ascends up.          The spinothalamic tract on the other hand synapses immediately upon entering.                    The organization of nerves in the dorsal column maintains a spatial organization all the way up to the cortex; this is known as somatotopy.                  Lower body information remains more medial in the gracile fasciculus.          Upper body information remains more lateral in the cuneate fasciculus.                    Sensory information from the head and neck enter the ventral posterior medial region of the thalamus, and thus isn’t a part of the dorsal column pathway (which is involved in sensation to the body).      Sensory information from the rest of the body enters the ventral posterior lateral region of the thalamus, which is a part of the dorsal column pathway.        What happens at the level of the brainstem?          The cuneate and gracile fasciculi terminate in the gracile nucleus and cuneate nucleus of the medulla.      This is where the FIRST SYNAPSE is.        After synapsing, the fibres then CROSS at the decussation of the medial lemniscus:          Recall that dorsal column = medial lemniscus.      The second order sensory neuron then continues, and terminates in the thalamus, in VPL (innervation to body).      The third order sensory neuron continues to innervate the postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex).        Corollaries:          Dorsal column sensory innervation is ipsilateral at the level of the spinal cord, but contralateral past the decussation of the medial lemniscus.      Hence we have that a:                  L sided medial lemniscus damage causes a R sided loss of dorsal column sensation.          L sided spinal cord damage causes a L sided loss of dorsal column sensation.                      Summary of the Dorsal Column      The dorsal column contains:              Discriminative Touch.        Pressure.        Vibration sense.        Proprioception.              Primary sensory neuron → ascends in the ipsilateral spinal cord WITHOUT SYNAPSING, and terminates at the gracile (lower body) and cuneate (upper body) nuclei of the medulla.    Secondary sensory neuron → leaves the gracile/cuneate nuclei, crosses at the decussation of the medial lemniscus, and goes to VPL.    Tertiary sensory neuron → leaves VPL, goes to the postcentral gyrus (where the primary somatosensory cortex is).    Gracile fasciculus = medial = lower extremities.    Cuneate fasciculus = lateral = upper extremities.       The cortical ‘space’ allocated to each part of the body correlates with their sensitivity:            However, this isn’t static; increased use of one region can result in increased sensitivity.      This is seen in braille readers, who rely on extended use of the somatosensory cortex in order to read braille.      Here, you see neuroplasticity; blind braille readers showed increased sensitivity in the hand that they used to read with.      Spinothalamic and Spinoreticular Pathways  These tracts carry the following sensory modalities:          Pain (nociception).      Temperature.        The spinothalamic/spinoreticular tract crosses at the level of the spinal cord:          Again, this differentiates these tracts from the dorsal column, which ascends without crossing.      Here, ascending fibres SYNAPSE IMMEDIATELY, at the dorsal horn.      Decussation then occurs immediately afterwards, at a region called the anterior white commisure.        Some fibres do not cross:          The vast majority of fibres synapse and cross at the level of the spinal cord, to become the lateral spinothalamic tract.      A minority of fibres synapse and stay on the ipsilateral side, to become the ventral/anterior spinothalamic tract.                  The lateral spinothalamic tract transmits pain and temperature.          The anterior spinothalamic tract transmits crude touch and firm pressure.                      Corollaries:          Hence, a lesion of the spinal cord will result in crossed sensory findings; a lesion on one side of the spinal cord will result in distal contralateral loss of pain/temperature, and an ipsilateral loss of vibration/proprioception.      However, a lesion in the brainstem (past where the dorsal column crosses) will result in contralateral findings for all sensory modalities.      This helps you localize an area of injury.        Destinations of spinothalamic/spinoreticular tracts:          Second order neurons:                  Some second order neurons terminate in VPL, of the thalamus.          Others actually terminate in the pulvinar or intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (recall that these were association nuclei).          Others go to the periaqueductal gray (responsible for pain suppression).          Finally, some (the ones involved in the spinoreticular tract) terminate in the reticular formation of the brainstem.                          The neurons of the reticular formation all play a crucial role in maintaining behavioral arousal and consciousness.                                           Third order neurons:                  Third order neurons distribute to primary and secondary/association sensory cortices (not just primary)          They also go to the cingulate &amp; insular cortex. Why?                          Pain is PAINFUL, and unpleasant. This response is due to integration in a different region of cortex.              The cingulate &amp; insular cortex are part of the limbic (emotional) system, and help us distinguish sensations as pleasant/unpleasant.                                            Summary of the Spinothalamic/Spinoreticular Tracts      The spinothalamic/spinoreticular tracts contain:              Pain (nociception).        Temperature.              Primary sensory neuron → enters the spinal cord, and synapses immediately.    Secondary sensory neuron → crosses at the anterior white commissure, and go to multiple destinations:              VPL of the thalamus.        Pulvinar and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus.        Periaqueductal gray (pain suppression).        Reticular formation (behaviour arousal + consciousness).              Tertiary sensory neuron → these leave the above destinations, and go to:              Primary sensory cortex (postcentral gyrus).        Secondary sensory areas (association areas).        Cingulate &amp; insular cortex (to distinguish pleasant/unpleasant sensations).                The cingulate/insular cortex response does not necessarily have to be due to direct pain:          You can actually feel unpleasant sensations due to empathy.      In one study, men were exposed to a painful stimuli, while their wives were undergoing fMRI.      Their cingulate/insular cortices showed activity suggesting that they felt their husband’s pain vicariously.      Interestingly, they never reversed the experiment (ie, subjecting the wives to pain while the husbands watched); they might not have had the same results!      Spinocerebellar Pathways  The spinocerebellar pathways play a role in subconscious proprioception:          This is your ‘innate limb position sense’, that never reaches the level of consciousness.      This is important in cerebellar smoothing and coordination of movement.      Note that this is different from conscious proprioception (‘yup, my thumb is sticking up’); but rather it’s the unconscious knowledge of where your body is in space.        As with the spinothalamic tract, ascending sensory fibres terminate immediately at the spinal cord:          They synapse at a deeper part of the dorsal horn than the spinothalamic tract, and then divert in two possible directions:                  Dorsal/posterior spinocerebellar tract → ascends straight up.          Ventral/anterior spinocerebellar tract → crosses over and ascends.                    This is important because the cerebellum, unlike the cortex, regulates the ipsilateral body.                  In other words, the R cerebellum coordinates movements for the R body, and vice versa.          Hence, the dorsal spinocerebellar tract is ascending on the ‘right’ side, but the ventral spinocerebellar tract is ascending on the ‘wrong’ side, and has to CROSS BACK (shown in green on the right).                      Corollary → some spinocerebellar routes are ipsilateral, while others are contralateral; so a one-sided spinal cord injury will not affect all proprioceptive fibres to the cerebellum.  Remember      Dorsal spinocerebellar tract ascends straight up.    Ventral spinocerebellar tract crosses over and then ascends.    Path of the spinocerebellar tracts:          The dorsal spinocerebellar tract enters at the inferior cerebellar peduncle (recall that this communicates to the cerebellum info about what your body is doing).      The ventral spinocerebellar tract enters at the superior cerebellar peduncle, and then crosses back to the ipsilateral side.      As mentioned before, this is because the ventral spinocerebellar tract has to cross back to end up on the right side of the cerebellum.      Both terminate in the spinocerebellum (vermis + intermediate hemisphere).        Summary of Pathways into the Cerebellum:          The middle cerebellar peduncle receives motor innervation from the primary motor cortex via the corticopontocerebellar pathway.                  Since the the cortex affects the contralateral body, while the cerebellum affects the ipsilateral body, these fibres must cross at the pons.                    The inferior cerebellar peduncle recveives proprioceptive info from the ipsilateral branches of the spinocerebellar pathways (the dorsal spinocerebellar tract).      The superior cerebellar peduncle receives proprioceptive info from the contralateral branches of the spioncerebellar pathways (the ventral spinocerebellar tract).      Descending info from the cortex tells the cerebellum ‘what was the order?’; ascending proprioceptive info from the spinal cord tells the cerebellum ‘where are you in space right now?’        Summary of the Spinocerebellar Pathways      The spinocerebellar pathways contain subconscious proprioception which is carried to the cerebellum.    Primary sensory neuron → enters the spinal cord, and synapses immediately.    Secondary sensory neuron → travel in 2 pathways:              Dorsal spinocerebellar tract → ascends ipsilaterally, and enters the inferior cerebellar peduncle.        Ventral spinocerebellar tract → ascends contralaterally, enters the superior cerebellar peduncle, and crosses back.

Know the cross-sectional anatomy of the spinal cord, including the differences at each level and the sensory and motor input and output organization.  Describe monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes. Review from Previous Lectures  CNS participants in the command of motor actions.          Ideomotor area (in the PMAA).      Premotor Cortex.      Primary Motor Cortex.      Basal ganglia.      Cerebellum.      Spinal reflexes.        The cerebellum is what we’ll be focusing on today.  In addition to the basal ganglia, the cerebellum acts as another regulatory centre for the motor cortex.          The basal ganglia is used to regulate the initation of actions, and tune motor cortex activity. For example, it’s used to make sure you use the right amount of force when picking up eggshells vs. picking up a rock.      The cerebellum is used to smooth and coordinate movement.        We saw the mechanism behind basal ganglia regulation in Basal Ganglia &amp; Diencephalon, via the direct/indirect striopallidal pathway.          Direct striopallidal pathway → feed-forward.      Indirect striopallidal pathway → inhibitory.        Today we’ll be looking at pathways involving the cerebellum.The CerebellumIntroduction to the Cerebellum  As mentioned before, the cerebellum plays a role in SMOOTHING and COORDINATING movement.          It acts to regulate the primary motor cortex, in addition to the basal ganglia.      Without the action of the cerebellum, you can have problems with balance, smooth motion, and fine movement.        What information would the cerebellum need to coordinate movement?          What is the command?                  This is information from the primary motor cortex.          This information gets into the cerebellum via the corticopontocerebellar pathway which we saw yesterday.          Recall that this was a pathway from the motor cortex → internal capsule → cerebral peduncle → pontine nuclei → middle cerebellar peduncle → cerebellum.                    How is your body moving with respect to itself?                  This is proprioception information, which comes from the spinal cord.          Proprioception can be divided into 2 categories: conscious and unconscious.                          Conscious proprioception needs to go through the cortex.              Unconscious proprioception doesn’t need to (it can just go into the cerebellum).                                The proprioception information that the cerebellum needs is actually unconscious proprioception.                    How is your balance? → this is vestibular information.        Inputs to the cerebellum      In order to function properly, the cerebellum requires 3 inputs:              What is the command? → ie. input from the primary motor cortex.        How is your body moving with respect to itself? → ie. proprioception input from the spinal cord.        How is your balance? → ie. vestibular input.              In other words, we need:              Primary Motor Cortex Information.        Proprioception Information.        Vestibular Information.            Anatomy of the Cerebellum  Like the cortex, there is a thin layer of gray matter on the outside of the cerebellum, with white matter inside.          However, the cerebellum has much more regular and fine folds compared to the cerebral cortex.      It also has less white matter relative to gray matter; this white matter is known as the arbor vitae, because of it’s fine branching pattern (like the tree of life).        The cerebellum can be subdivided based on anatomy (into lobes), or based on function (into regions).  Anatomical Subdivision:          Lobes of the Cerebellum:                  Anterior lobe.          Posterior lobe.          Focculonodular lobe.                    The anterior lobe is separated from the posterior lobe by the primary fissure.      The flocculonodular lobe contains the flocculus and nodule      You can see these features below, where the cerebellum has been ‘flattened out’.                  Basically, if you note the c-shape drawn on the top-left, the flattened cerebellum has been formed by unfolding it so that the c is flat.                      Functional Subdivision:          With a functional subdivision of the cerebellum, instead of splitting it into lobes anteriorly to posteriorly, you split it into sections medially to laterally.      Regions of the Cerebellum:                  Vermis          Intermediate Hemisphere          Lateral Hemisphere                    This division relates to how information enters the cerebellum      Functional Divisions of the Cerebellum  As mentioned above, the cerebellum needs 3 inputs:          Primary Motor Cortex.      Proprioception.      Vestibular.        These 3 inputs correspond to 3 ‘destinations’ in the cerebellum:          Cerebrocerebellum → receives PMC input (from cerebrum).      Spinocerebellum → receives proprioception input (from spinal cord).      Vestibulocerebellum → receives vestibular input (from otolith organs).        These destinations are comprised of the functional regions we described above:          Cerebrocerebellum = lateral hemisphere.      Spinocerebellum = vermis + intermediate hemisphere.      Vestibulocerebellum = flocculonodular lobe.      Connections to the Cerebellum  As seen before, there are 3 connections between the cerebellum and the rest of the body:          Superior Cerebellar Peduncle → connects to MIDBRAIN &amp; DIENCEPHALON.      Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → connects to PONS.      Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle → connects to MEDULLA &amp; SPINAL CORD.        Each carries different information:          Superior Cerebellar Peduncle → carries OUTPUT from the cerebellum back into the thalamus (hence it conencts to the diencephalon). It also carries some proprioception information.      Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → carries INPUT from the primary motor cortex, via the corticopontocerebellar pathway.      Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle → carries INPUT from the medulla/spinal cord, concerning proprioception and balance.      Summary of the Cerebellum  The spinocerebellum is the vermis and intermediate hemispheres on the midline of the cerebellum whose primary input is from the spinal cord.  The cerebrocerebellum is the lateral hemisphere that receives input from the cerebral cortex via the corticopontocerebellar tract.  The vestibulocerebellum is the flocculonodular lobe that receives vestibular information from brain stem nuclei.  To coordinate and refine movements the cerebellum receives the necessary information from the motor cortex on what the command is (cerebrocerebellum). It can then compare this with where the body is in space, including limb position (spinocerebellum) as well as equilibrium and balance (vestibulocerebellum). Information is then sent back to the cerebral cortex to provide a correction to the command on a continuous basis.

The Spinal CordGross anatomy of the spinal cordSpinal cord = where spinal nerves enter and exit.Cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral.Leave between vertabra (intervertebral foramina).Ends at L2 ish, filum terminaleREVIEW.Cauda equina.See MSK lectures.Filum terminale, attaches end of spinal cord to coccyx so it doesn’t float arround.The spinal cord lies within the vertebral canal. However, it only extends asfar lumbar vertebra L1 or L2. The tapered end of the spinal cord is knownas the conus medullaris. The filiium terminale is a long filament of connective tissue that anchorsthe spinal cord to the coccyx. There are 31 spinal nerves, including 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5sacral and 1 coccygeal nerve. These spinal nerves leave the spinal canalthrough the corresponding intervertebral foramina. Since the spinal cord isnot as long as the vertebral column, the spinal nerves descending below theconus medullaris are known as the cauda equina. Cerebrospinal fluid canbe sampled in the region of the cauda equina below the conus medullaris. The cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord are related tothe innervation of the limbs.Cervical and lumbar enlargement = where nerves going out to limbs originate (more output to limbs than trunk).Gray matter is H shaped structure in middleEverything on outside is FIBRES; white matter, both ascending and descending.Connect spinal cord to other parts of spinal cord, and to brain.Sensory enter spinal nerves via DORSAL ROOTS; sensory only.Before it enters, splits into multiple dorsal root filaments. Terminates at dorsal horn.Dorsal root ganglion, comprised of cell bodies of all the unipolar sensory neurons.Below that ON IMAGE = ventral root, ventral root filaments, connected to ventral horn of spinal cord.Somatomotor + visceral motor info.Ventral root = MOTOR INFO only.The dorsal and ventral roots combine to form the SPINAL NERVES.These then split into dorsal and ventral rami; unlike the roots, these contain a mix of sensory and motor innervation.	- Dorsal rami -&gt; dorsal part of body.	- Ventral rami -&gt; ventral part of body, much thicker since includes limbs.White matter on lateral side = lateral funiculus.White matter on ventral side = anterior funiculus?Cross section of thoracic spinal cord.SYMPATHETIC TRUNK.H in thoracic spinal cord is different.At this level, there’s a little bump of grey matter into white matter. (bumps on side of H)The intermediolateral nucleus (IML) = LATERAL HORN is a region of grey matter found in one of the three grey columns of the spinal cord, the lateral grey column. This is Rexed lamina VII.Location for cell bodies of sympathetic outflow. ONLY HERE SINCE SYMPATHETIC CHAIN ONLY RUNS FROM T1 to L2.Visceral motor, act like motor neurons, join ventral roots, go out to innervate organs and blood vessels of skin and muscles.Sympathetic outflow does not go directly to organ; synapses (preganglionic neuron and postganglionic neuron).Leaves spinal cord in ventral root, goes through rami communicantes into sympathetic ganglia.Synapses there, then goes back and REJOINS DORSAL AND VENTRAL RAMI, then provides sympathetic output to skin + muscle.Skeletal muscle; only the axon that leaves the spinal cord that innervates skeletal muscle, cell body remains within CNS.HENCE THERE’S NO VENTRAL ROOT GANGLION.Why isn’t there a ventral root ganglion? The dorsal root ganglion is not for protection. It is the site where the cell bodies of afferent (sensory) neurons are found. The cell bodies of efferent (motor) neurons, the axons of which form the ventral root, are located within the spinal cord, thus no enlargement. (Ganglion derives from the term for knot.)Spinal cord transection?Above sympathetic outflow, big issues with things like urination, defecation, etc.The spinal cord is the entry point for sensory information in spinal nerves. Thesensory information enters by the dorsal root. The dorsal roots separate into dorsalroot filaments before entering the spinal cord. The cell bodies of the sensory neurons are contained in the dorsal root ganglion inthe peripheral nervous system. The spinal cord contains somatic motor neurons whose axons extend to skeletalmuscle via spinal nerves. It also has contains visceral (sympathetic andparasympathetic) motor neurons with axons in the spinal nerves. The somatic and visceral motor neurons exit the spinal cord via the ventral roots. Themotor neuron axons exit the spinal cord as ventral neuron filaments before formingthe ventral root. The dorsal and ventral roots join immediately distal to the dorsal root ganglion. At thispoint the spinal nerve is a mixed nerve containing both sensory and motor fibres. Each mixed spinal nerve divides into a dorsal and ventral ramus. The dorsal ramiinnervates the skin and muscles of the back. The ventral rami innervate the skin andmuscles of the ventral trunk and limbs. Sympathetic motor neurons seen in spinal segments T1-L2, project to sympatheticganglion via rami communicantes and rejoin the spinal nerve via a separate ramicommunicantes.Dorsal funiculusVentral funiculusDorsal horn for dorsal roots.Ventral horn for motor neurons leave through ventral roots.Intermediate zone = interneurons doing connections between destinations in spinal cord.Lateral horn = ONLY BY SYMPATHETIC CHAIN. Preganglionic, have to synapse in ganglia (eg. synapse in sympathetic chain).Sections associated with the limbs have greater amountof gray matter (cervical and lumbar enlargements) White matter decreases from rostral to caudal: fewerdescending and ascending fiber fibers Gray matter of T1 to L2 has a lateral horn: the lateralhorn or the intermedial lateral cell column, the origin ofsympathetic preganglionic neurons= MAKES SENSE, less stuff going up or down! C1 necessary contains all fibres going from brain to C1 down to bottom, or back up. Sensory information at sacral joins lumbar, etc.C5 and L3 have larger size; eg. example of location where innervation to limbs take place.Note their really big ventral horns for controlling arms and hands.Anatomists (they have no life!) have looked within the spinal cord, and divided them anatomically similar to the cortex (broddman’s areas).10 laminae of rexed; different nuclei.Not important; just know that motor out through ventral horn, sensory in from dorsal horn, etc.The cuneate and gracile fasciculi together are known as the dorsal or posteriorfuniculus. The fibre tracts at the base of the spinal cord are the ventral or anterior funiculus. Sensory input terminates in the dorsal horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord. Somatic motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of the gray matter. Interneurons are located in the intermediate zone of the gray matter. The central canal contains the CSF made in the ventricles of the brain and iscontinuous with the IV ventricle. The white matter contains multiple ascending and descending sensory and motorpathways to the brain, both crossed and uncrossed.Spinal canal continuous with 4th ventricle. There is decreasing white matter caudally in the spinal cord. Some of the descendingpathways are terminating at higher levels and there are more ascending pathwaysjoining the white matter fibre tracts. There are some specialized nuclei in the spinal cord. In addition, the spinal cord graymatter has been divided into ten lamina of Rexed.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/20/anatomy-cerebellum-spinal-cord.html"},

Name the motor and sensory nerves of the orbit and describe their function  State the general distribution of the ophthalmic artery and the clinical significance of occlusion of its main branch to the retina  Outline the general distribution of the veins of the orbit, stating the clinical significance of anastomoses of ophthalmic veins with the cavernous sinus and extracranial veinsIntroduction to the Orbit  Orbit → the cavity or socket of the skull in which the eye and its appendages are situated. “Orbit” can refer to the bony socket, or it can also be used to imply the contents.  The eye is largely held in the bony orbit by a large amount of fat.  Muscles also help keep the eye in place (the extra-ocular eye muscles).Bones of the Orbit  Objective      Name the bones that form the walls of the orbit and state susceptibility to fracture.    Frontal Bone → roof.  Maxilla → floor.          The maxillary sinus lies right below the orbit; hence the floor of the orbit is quite thin.      Hence, the floor of the orbit is highly susceptible to fracture.        Ethmoid  Recall that this was in the anterior cranial cavity, and included the cribriform plate and the crista galli.          Forms part of the medial wall of the orbit, and is also highly susceptible to fracture. This part is called the lamina papyracea (paper thin), aka the orbital lamina of the ethmoid.        Sphenoid          Both the lesser and greater wing of the sphenoid are represented on the lateral wall, with a slit between them called the superior orbital fissure.      Recall from Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity 2 that the CN III, IV, V1, and VI travel through here. That is, the 3 motor nerves to the eye + the sensory innervation to the ophthalmic region.      We also see a hole in the lesser wing of the sphenoid, the optic canal; this is where the optic nerve goes through.        Zygomatic Bone → Forms the lateral-most margin of the orbit.  Lacrimal          A tiny bone on the medial side of the orbit with a hole that drains into the nose (the nasolacrimal duct).      Drains into the inferior meatus along the lateral nasal wall.      This is why your nose gets stuffy when you cry!        Bones of the Orbit      Roof → frontal bone.    Floor → maxillary bone.    Medial wall → ethmoid (lamina papyracea), lacrimal, maxillary bone.    Lateral wall → zygomatic bone, sphenoid (greater + lesser wing).    Weak Points in the Orbit:              Maxilla → thin due to the presence of the maxillary sinus immediately below.        Lamina Papyracea → thin bone, part of ethmoid, on medial side of orbit.            Blowout Fractures  Direct trauma to the orbital bones is rare; more often, fractures occur due to indirect trauma to the head.  Indirect blows that displace the orbital walls will often result in a fracture of the weak parts of the orbit.  This can result in:          Medial wall blowout fracture (fracture at the lamina papyracea).      Inferior wall blowout fracture (fracture of the maxilla above the maxillary sinus).        With an inferior wall blowout fracture, you can often see the fat surrounding the orbit herniate into the maxillary sinus.          This is known as a teardrop sign (can see this on the CT on the right).      The Lacrimal Apparatus  Lacrimal fluid (tears) is formed by the lacrimal gland.          This is an almond shaped gland located in the lateral part of the orbit, just beneath the frontal bone, and just above the eyeball.        By blinking, we spread this lacrimal fluid across the cornea, laterally to medially.  On the medial side, this fluid drains into the nasal cavities via the nasolacrimal duct.          This fluid enters the duct via superior and inferior puncta, which carry fluid into the superior and inferior canaliculi, and then into the lacrimal sac.      Muscles of the Orbit  7 extraocular muscles:          1 eyelid muscle → levator palpebrae superioris.      4 recti muscles → superior, inferior, medial, lateral.      2 oblique muscles → superior, inferior.        These function to move the eye within the orbit, or elevate the eyelid (levator palpebrae superioris).  Movements of the eye include:          Elevation      Depression      ADduction.      ABduction      Internal Rotation.      External Rotation.        Positions of the Extraocular Muscles:            The superior, inferior, medial, and lateral recti attach where you’d expect them to attach; onto the superior, inferior, medial, and lateral eye.      The superior oblique and the inferior oblique, as their names suggest, attach to the eye obliquely.      Note that the superior oblique wraps around a ‘sling’ called the trochlea, which reverses the direction of its muscles fibres.      As a result, when it pulls, it moves in the opposite direction as what you’d expect given it’s origin and attachment.      In other words, although it attaches to a similar location as the superior rectus, it actually antagonizes the superior rectus.      Something similar happens with the inferior oblique, which wraps around the eye, and antagonizes the action of the inferior rectus.        Actions of the Extraocular Muscles:            You’d think that this is straightforward; since the superior rectus attaches to the top of the eye, it should elevate it!      But it’s actually a (little bit) more complicated, because the axis of the orbit and the axis of the eye are not the same. There is actually a 23° degree difference between the two.        Since the extraocular muscles originate at the orbit, and attach to the eye, they don’t pull along the axis of the eye.                   The end result of this is that the superior and inferior rectus also function to adduct the eye, and the superior and inferior oblique also function to abduct the eye.                    Hence, their true functions are as follows:                  Superior Rectus → elevate and adduct eye.          Inferior Rectus → depress and adduct eye.          Lateral Rectus → abduction of the eye.          Medial Rectus → adduction of the eye.          Superior Oblique → depress and abduct eye (ANTAGONIZES SUPERIOR RECTUS)          Inferior Oblique → elevate and abduct eye (ANTAGONIZES INFERIOR RECTUS)                    What about the Levator Palpebrae Superioris?                    The levator palpebrae superioris attaches to the tarsal plate (cartilage of the eyelid) and does exactly what its name suggests; it raises the eyelid.          Interestingly, there is a conjoint tendon between the superior rectus and the levator palpebrae.          Hence, when you look up, you also have activation of the levator palpebrae superioris in addition to the superior rectus.          This prevents you from seeing the back of your eyelid!                      Motor innervation of the Extraocular Muscles:          Everything is innervated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III), with TWO EXCEPTIONS:                  Superior Oblique, which is innervated by CN IV (Trochlear).          Lateral Rectus, which is innervated by CN VI (Abducens).                    These are easy to remember, the superior oblique goes through the trochlea, hence ‘trochlear nerve’, and the lateral rectus abducts the eye, hence ‘abducens nerve’.      The rest of the muscles (superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris) are all done by CN III.      Testing the Extraocular Muscles  Testing the extraocular muscles is more difficult than just moving the eye in the direction of each of the muscle actions.          This is because there is redundant action between extraocular muscles, so this would not isolate the muscle of interest.      For example, if you tried to test the superior oblique by asking a patient to depress and abduct their eye, you won’t be sure if their ability to depress the eye is due to the inferior rectus or the superior oblique.        To resolve this, you have to eliminate the action of the redundant muscle:          Using the same example as above, suppose we’re assessing the action of the superior oblique:                  The superior oblique does depression + abduction.          The inferior rectus does depression + adduction.                    To eliminate the downward pull of the IR, you can adduct the eye:                  This brings the axis of the eye in line with the axis of the pulling force of the SO, so it will override the downward pull of the IR.          Now, when you depress the eye, you can be sure that this depression is primarily due to the action of the SO.                        This is reflected in the figure to the right; when you’re testing the muscles that attach above or below the eye, you actually move the eye in a direction that differs from their action.          You can remember the directions for testing by imagining that you’re flipping the actions in a mirror; everything is still the same vertically, but things are transposed horizontally.

Inferior oblique has the opposite function as the inferior rectus.  Nerves of the Orbit  Sight → Optic Nerve (CN II)  Motor to Extraocular Muscles:          Trochlear Nerve (CN IV) → superior oblique.      Abducens Nerve (CN VI) → lateral rectus.      Oculomotor Nerve (CN III) → everything else.        Sensory to Orbit → Ophthalmic nerve = V1 branch of the trigeminal.            Recall that the 3 branches of the trigeminal were the ophthalmic, maxillary, and submandibular branches.      V1 (the ophthalmic branch) then gives off 3 main sub-branches:                  Frontal          Lacrimal          Nasociliary                    Cranial Nerve Palsies to the Eye  Oculomotor Nerve Palsy           Results in unopposed action of the trochlear nerve (superior oblique; down + out) and the abducens nerve (out).      Hence, patients with an oculomotor nerve palsy will present with a depressed, abducted eye on the affected side.      Will also have ptosis on the affected side without the action of the levator palpebrae superioris.        Trochlear Nerve Palsy           Commonly injured by trauma.      The trochlear nerve innervates the SO, responsible for depression + abduction.      Hence, a palsy would result in a baseline elevation + adduction of eye (an ‘up and in’ position).      Abduction would still be possible via the lateral rectus (abducens).        Abducens Nerve Palsy           Affects the lateral rectus, the main abductor of the eye.      Results in an inability to abduct, resulting in a characteristic head turn to avoid double vision.      Often seen injured with bad falls (causing increased intracranial pressure).      Arteries of the Orbit  The main artery to the orbit is the ophthalmic artery, off the internal carotid artery.          This branches off near where it emerges from the cavernous sinus, near the pituitary gland.      This runs in the optic canal with the optic nerve.        The opthalmic artery gives off a bunch of branches, which generally run with branches of the ophthalmic nerve.          These aren’t too important, except for one branch, the central retinal artery.      The central retinal artery is a tiny artery that goes into the dural sheath of the optic nerve, and intermingles with the fibres of the nerve.      It’s important because it’s the ONLY BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE EYE.      Hence, if something goes wrong with this artery, you go blind!      This is unlike most other key organs, where there is collateral circulation. With the eye, you only have one feeding vessel!        Remember      The central retinal artery is the ONLY blood supply to the eye!    Occlusion will thus lead to BLINDNESS.  Veins of the Orbit  With the venous drainage of the orbit, note that we have 2 ophthalmic veins (superior and inferior), as opposed to only 1 ophthalmic artery.          The superior ophthalmic vein runs through the superior orbital fissure, the inferior ophthalmic vein runs through the inferior orbital fissure.        Recall from Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity I, that the facial vein connects to the ophthalmic veins, and could become a route for infection.          Recall the DANGER TRIANGLE, where an infection can spread from the facial vein → ophthalmic veins → cavernous sinus → meningitis.        Review of the Cavernous Sinus            Recall that the ICA runs through the cavernous sinus (only part of the body where an artery runs through a vein).      The abducens runs right beside the ICA, while III, IV, V1 and V2 lie on the lateral walls.      An infection that tracks into the cavernous sinus can affect all of these nerves, although the abducens is usually affected first (since it lies inside the sinus).      Worsening infections can then involve III and IV, and can even affect the optic nerve (which lies above the sinus).      Hence, knowing the anatomy of the cavernous sinus is hugely clinically important.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/19/anatomy-orbit.html"},
	{"title": "Brainstem &amp; Cranial Nerves", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Identify the 3 major subdivisions of the brainstem and describe the anatomic relationships of the major motor and sensory nuclei and the major descending and ascending tracts in the brainstem.  Know the twelve cranial nerves, where they exit the brain and their normal function.  Be able to determine the major symptoms and signs of dysfunction resulting from lesions in the brain stem.The BrainstemSubdivisions of the Brainstem  Objective      Identify the 3 major subdivisions of the brainstem and describe the anatomic relationships of the major motor and sensory nuclei and the major descending and ascending tracts in the brainstem.    The brainstem, as the name suggests, sits at the base of the brain and connects it to the spinal cord.          The cranial nerves largely come out at the level of the brainstem.        Subdivisions of the brainstem:          Midbrain.      Pons.      Medulla (Oblongata).        The midbrain is located inferior to the thalamus, and posterior to the pituitary.          Running through the midbrain is the cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius), which connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle.      The third ventricle is the space between the two lobes of the thalamus.      The fourth ventricle is the space between the pons/medulla and the cerebellum, and is continuous with the spinal canal.        The pons is a bulbous projection off the ventral surface of the brainstem.  The medulla lies below the pons, and is continuous with the spinal cord.Anatomical Features of the BrainstemVentral Surface of the Brainstem  Olfaction and vision don’t go through the brainstem, however they are shown in the figure below to be running above it:          Olfactory tract → the afferent tract for olfactory information to reach the uncus (in the temporal lobe).                  Note that olfactory information isn’t relayed through the thalamus, recall from Basal Ganglia &amp; Diencephalon that olfaction was the ONLY sensory modality that didn’t.                    Optic tract → the afferent tract for visual information to reach the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.                  Recall that the optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, and when they branch off again, they’re referred to as the optic tract.                      Ventral Features at the Midbrain:          Cerebral peduncles → continuation of the internal capsule (these were the projection fibres to and from the deep gray matter). These carry information between the brain and the lower brainstem and spinal cord.      Partially covering the dorsal midbrain are mamillary bodies that project off the hypothalamus; these are part of the limbic system.        Ventral Features at the Pons:          There are lots of medial → lateral fibres wrapping around the pons, which reflects how information that reaches the pons reflects around to feed to the cerebellum.      Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → this is the connection between the pons &amp; cerebellum, carrying the information that came down from the cerebral peduncles from the primary motor cortex.                  This peduncle is the one that tells the cerebellum “what action is being done”, which helps the cerebellum coordinate your movements.                      Ventral Features at the Medulla:          The medulla is continuous with the spinal cord, so its main role is to communicate motor information from the brain down into the spinal cord.      On the ventral surface of the medulla, you can see the medullary pyramids, which contain the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts:                  Corticobulbar tract → carries motor information of the cranial nerves.          Corticospinal tract → carries motor information down the spinal cord to the rest of the body.          There are 2 medullary pyramids (L &amp; R), which are separated by a ventral median sulcus.                    At this level, the information in the corticospinal tract (which will go down the spinal cord) is uncrossed, even though the L hemisphere controls the R body.                  To ‘fix’ this, the information crosses at a midline feature called the pyramidal decussation.                    Finally, lateral to the pyramids are the olivary nuclei, which give into the cerebellum.      Dorsal Surface of the Brainstem  Dorsal Features above the Brainstem:          Parts of the thalamus, including:                  Lateral geniculate (visual relay).          Medial genicular (auditory relay).          Pulvinar nucleus of thalamus.                    Epithalamus (pineal gland).        Dorsal Features at the Midbrain:  Recall in Neurophysiology of the Visual Cortex that the superior colliculus was one of 2 destinations for optic tract axons other than the LGN. The other was the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which controls the pupillary light reflex.          Superior colliculus (x2) → receives direct visual information, and guides orientation &amp; reflex tracking of moving objects.      Inferior colliculus (x2) → receives direct auditory reflexes, and controlls auditory reflexes (eg. startle in response to a sudden sound).      Together, the superior and inferior colliculus are known as the corpora quadrigemina.      Superior Cerebellar Peduncle → one of 3 connections to the cerebellum.        Dorsal Features at the Pons:          Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → another of the 3 connections to the cerebellum.        Dorsal Features at the Medulla:          Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle → the last of the 3 connections to the cerebellum.      Gracile tubercle and cuneate tubercle → sensory relay nuclei from spinal cord.  This sensory information is fine touch, proprioception, and vibration sense ONLY; pain and temperature run in a different tract.                  the fibre tracts carrying the corresponding neurons are the cuneate + gracile fasciculus.          As we’ll see in a later lecture (Ascending Sensory Pathways), the gracile fasciculus carries lower body sensory information, and the cuneate fasciculus carries upper body sensory information.                      The cerebellar peduncles:          As mentioned above, there are 3 cerebellar peduncles, that are responsible for connecting the cerebellum to the rest of the brain.                  Superior cerebellar peduncle → connects cerebellum to midbrain and diencephalon.          Middle cerebellar peduncle → connects cerebellum to pons.          Inferior cerebellar peduncle → connects cerebellum to medulla and spinal cord.                    We’ll see in a later lecture (Ascending Sensory Pathways), that each of these 3 peduncles carry different information.      As a brief summary:  The superior cerebellar peduncle also carries some proprioceptive information, as we’ll see later.                  The superior cerebellar peduncle takes OUTPUT from the cerebellum back to the cortex.          The middle cerebellar peduncle takes INPUT from the primary motor cortex (“what was the order?”)          The inferior cerebellar peduncle takes INPUT from vestibular and some proprioceptive sources (“what is my balance like? Where am I in space?”).                    Summary of Features of the Brainstem  Midbrain → the midbrain mainly functions to relay information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, via the cerebral peduncles.          Also present are the superior and inferior colliculi, which receive direct visual and auditory information, respectively.        Pons → the pons mainly functions to relay motor output from the brain into the cerebellum via the middle cerebral peduncle:          As we’ll see later, it is part of a pathway called the corticopontocerebellar pathway, which is exactly what it sounds like.        Medulla → the medulla is continuous with the brainstem, so its dorsal side mostly functions to carry sensory information up, and its ventral side mostly functions to carry motor information down.          Sensory information is carried up by the gracile (medial) and cuneate (lateral) fasciculi.      Motor information is carried down by the corticospinal tracts, which cross at the pyramidal decussation.

Cranial NervesExits of the Cranial Nerves  The exits of the cranial nerves are as follows:          Above Brainstem → I, II.      Midbrain → III, IV.      Pons → V, VI, VII, VIII.      Medulla → IX, X, XII.  It’s easy to remember that XI comes off the spinal cord because the nerve itself is called the SPINAL accessory nerve.      Spinal Cord → XI.        A screening neurological exam, which covers II, III, IV, VI, IX, X, XII, includes at least 1 cranial nerve from each of the midbrain/pons/medulla.          Hence, even though you don’t cover all the cranial nerves, you still have enough information for localization.        More specifically, their exits are as follows:          III comes off the ventral midbrain.      IV comes off the dorsal midbrain, and reflects to the ventral side.      V comes off the pons proper.      VI, VII, VIII come off the interface between the pons and medulla (medially to laterally).      IX, X, XI come off in a row along the medulla &amp; spinal cord (superiorly to inferiorly).      XII comes off the medulla medial to the IX, X, XI row.        Exits of the Cranial Nerves      Above Brainstem → I, II.    Midbrain → III, IV.    Pons → V, VI, VII, VIII.    Medulla → IX, X, XII    Spinal Cord → XI.  Functions of the Cranial Nerves  The optic nerve is considered to the part of the CNS, since it is derived from the diencephalon during fetal development:          As a result, the nerve fibers are covered by myelin produced by oligodendrocytes rather than Schwann cells (of the peripheral nervous system).       The nerve is actually encased by the dura and pia- arachnoid membranes and lies within the subarachnoid space.       Also, neuropathies that only effect the peripheral nervous system, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, do not affect the optic nerve.        Remember      The optic nerve is considered to be part of the CNS.  Cross-Sections of the BrainstemCross Section of the Midbrain  Below is a cross section of the midbrain, at the level of the inferior colliculi (recall, these receive direct auditory information).          On the dorsal side, you can see the inferior colliculi.      On the ventral side, you can see the cerebral peduncles, which as we said, was an extension of the internal capsule.      We also see CN III exiting the midbrain (III &amp; IV exit midbrain).        Note that the substantia nigra is part of the midbrain; we saw that this projected dopamingeric innervation to the striatum of the basal ganglia, and was affected in Parkinson’s.  Around the cerebral aqueduct (which connects the 3rd and 4th ventricles), is an aptly named periaqueductal gray:          As the name suggests, this is gray matter around the cerebral aqueduct.      It plays an important role in pain suppression at the level of the spinal cord.        Of less importance is the red nucleus, which plays a minor role in motor control.  There are also lots of other small nuclei related to cranial nerve input and output.Cross Section of the Pons  Below is a cross section of the pons, bisecting the cerebellum.          Between the pons and cerebellum you can see a gap; this is the 4th ventricle.      In addition, you can see parts of all 3 of the cerebellar peduncles:                  Superior cerebellar peduncle coming from the diencephalon &amp; midbrain.          Middle cerebellar peduncle coming from the pons.          Inferior cerebellar peduncle coming from the medulla &amp; spinal cord.                      Here you also see the corticospinal tract; this is a continuation from the cerebral peduncle carrying motor information to the rest of the body.          Note that the corticospinal tract is much smaller than the cerebral peduncle; this is because a lot of the fibres have terminated!      These other fibres end at the pontine nuclei, synapse in the pons, and then travel along the middle cerebellar peduncle into the cerebellum.      This is part of the corticopontocerebellar pathway.        The Corticopontocerebellar Pathway      Motor information travelling down the cerebral peduncle either:              Continues down to the rest of the body via the corticospinal tract.        Goes into the cerebellum to control balance/coordination via the corticopontocerebellar pathway.              The corticopontocerebellar pathway is a 2 neuron pathway:              Primary neuron → starts at the primary motor cortex, travels down the cerebral peduncle, and synapses with the pontine nuclei.        Secondary neuron → travels from the pontine nuclei, decussates (crosses), goes into the middle cerebellar peduncle, and enters the cerebellum.              Cross Section of the Medulla  Dorsal Side:          Gracile nucleus → point of termination for lower limb (dorsal column) somatosensory information coming up from the spinal cord.      Cuneate nucleus → point of termination for upper limb (dorsal column) somatosensory information coming up from the spinal cord.        Ventral Side:          Pyramid → comprises the fibres of the corticospinal tract and the corticobulbar tract, above the level of the pyramidal decussation (where the fibres cross to the contralateral side).      Olivary nucleus → lateral to pyramid, recall that we said that this gives input to the cerebellum.      CN XII → recall that we mentioned that this did not run in that row along the side of the medulla/spinal cord with IX, X, and XI. This is more medial, as shown here.        In addition there are visceral sensory &amp; motor nuclei here.  Summary      Scattered throughout the brain stem is a large collection of neurons known as the reticular formation. The reticular formation does not form discrete nuclei. Based on the location in the brain stem, the reticular formation can participate in several functions, including control of movement, modulation of pain, autonomic reflexes and arousal.    There is also a large amount of white matter in the brain stem consisting of pathways for brain stem connections as well as pathways for axons connecting the forebrain (cerebrum and diencephalon) with the spinal cord.    Midbrain Cross-Section      The inferior and superior colliculi (auditory and visual reflexes) are seen as large nuclei in the dorsal region of the midbrain.    The periaqueductal gray is a large collection of neurons surrounding the cerebral aqueduct (connects the III and IV ventricles). The periaqueductal gray is involved in suppression of pain and autonomic responses.    The red nucleus is another large group of neurons observed ventrally in the midbrain and is involved in flexion movement of the limbs.    Immediately dorsal to the cerebral peduncles is the substantia nigra that contains the dopamine neurons that terminate in the striatum.    Pons Cross-Section      The pontine nuclei are seen as a very large collection of nuclei in the ventral pons.    The corticospinal tract is located within the pontine nuclei. It is much smaller than the cerebral peduncle in the midbrain since many of the axons have terminated in the pontine nuclei.    The corticopontocerebellar pathway is an important pathway for motor control.               One set of neurons originates in the motor region of the cerebral cortex and project to the pontine nuclei via the internal capsule (diencephalon) and then via the cerebral peduncles (midbrain).         In the pontine nuclei there is a synapse onto a second set of neurons that first decussates (crosses the midline) and then enters the cerebellum via the middles cerebellar peduncle. This pathway sends information regarding motor commands to the cerebellum.              Medulla Cross-Section      The gracile and cuneate nuclei are located in the dorsal region of the medulla. They relay somatosensory information from the spinal cord to the thalamus.    Autonomic control nuclei (visceral sensory and motor) are located near the midline in the medulla. Other autonomic and respiratory control nuclei are located in the pons and midbrain.    The inferior olivary nucleus is located in the ventral part of the medulla. It has connections with the cerebellum for proprioception (limb position in space).    The pyramids containing the corticospinal axons for motor control are located at the very ventral aspect of the medulla.

	{"title": "Neurophysiology of the Visual Cortex", "text": "Central Visual Pathways  Signals are conveyed via the retinal ganglion cells up the optic nerve, and into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus.  Before reaching the LGN, some of the fibres of the optic nerve cross over at the optic chiasm.  After a synapse in the LGN, visual signals are then sent to the primary visual cortex (located around the calcarine sulcus).  What nerves cross at the optic chiasm?            Information from the left visual field is sent to the right visual cortex and vice versa.      Note that this is NOT THE SAME as having everything from the right eye go to the left visual cortex (this DOESN’T happen).      What actually happens is that everything on the left side of what you see goes to the right cortex, and vice versa. This is confusing, because the image information from the left visual field enters both the left and right eyes.      Hence, the fibres that actually cross are as follows:                  Information from the left visual field going into the left eye.          Information from the right visual field going into the right eye.                    Note that, as shown below, the L &amp; R visual field is defined by the fixation point that your eyes are focused on.      Clinical Correlations  Given the above crossing pattern, we can make some predictions as to what clinical findings we’d see with different pathologies.Example 1  Below, the L optic nerve is cut, so we don’t see anything from the L eye.  On the bottom right, the figure shows the visual deficit experienced by the patient, NOT the portion of the retina that’s affected.  Because you can receive information from both the L &amp; R visual field from both eyes, you’d end up with the following:          No information from the L or R visual field coming into the L eye.      Information from both the L and R visual field coming into the R eye.        Hence, we have blindness in the L eye.Example 2  Here, the optic chiasm is split in two.  Now, what we lose is the information crossing the optic chiasm. As before:          Information from the left visual field going into the left eye.      Information from the right visual field going into the right eye.Note that temporal and nasal refer to the lateral and medial sides of the each visual field respectively.        This results in the visual defect shown below → bitemporal hemianopsia.          When you close the R eye, you lose the L visual field.      When you close the L eye, you lose the R visual field.        Recall that this was a common finding with large pituitary adenomas, which compress the optic chiasm.Example 3  Here, the R optic tract is cut.  Note that optic nerve = before the optic chiasm, while optic tract = after the optic chiasm.  Since the R optic tract receives the information from the L visual fields of both eyes, you end up losing the L visual field information from both eyes.  This results in a finding called left homonymous hemianopsia.          Homonymous = same on both sides.      Hemianopsia = half cannot see.        Remember      Optic nerve = before the optic chiasm.    Optic tract = after the optic chiasm.  Projections of the Optic Tract  90% of the optic tract axons go to the LGN of the thalamus (top right)  The other 10% go to the midbrain (bottom right), to 2 particular regions:          Superior colliculus (guides orientation).      Edinger-Westphal Nucleus (for the pupillary light reflex).        Note that the Edinger-Westphal nucleus mediates the pupillary light reflex, and not the LGN.          Hence, you don’t need a functioning thalamus to have a functional pupillary light reflex!        The LGN is composed of 6 layers:          Layers 1-2 receive information from magnocellular cells.      Layers 3-6 receive information from parvocellular cells.      This is a continuation of the functional division that we saw in the processing in the retina.      Furthermore, the information from each eye remains segregated at this point (each layer is monocular).      In other word, although layers 1 and 2 both receive information from magnocellular cells, they receive this information from a different eye.      Convergence only happens at the level of the visual cortex.        Recall from the previous lecture that:          Magnocellular (M) ganglion cells receive information mainly from rods in the peripheral retina.      Parvocellular (P) ganglion cells receive information mainly from cones in the fovea.      In addition, since the rods are the light sensitive ones, the M-cells also project to the midbrain to mediate the pupillary light reflex and orientation.      Projections from the LGN  Neurons from the LGN project to the primary visual cortex.          This is via a fibre bundle called the optic radiation.      As mentioned before, the primary visual cortex is located along the calcarine sulcus in the occipital lobe.        SYNONYMS for the Primary Visual Cortex:           Striate cortex, V1, area 17  Recall from Introduction to Neurophysiology that layer 4 of the cortex is responsible for reciving information, and that layers 3 &amp; 5 are responsible for sending it.      Area 17 is based on the Brodmann classification we saw previously.      The term ‘striate cortex’ derives from the ‘stripy’ appearance of the cortical layers, due to intense input from LGN into layer 4 of the cortex.        Summary of the Path of Visual Information      Light    Photoreceptors              Rods        Cones              Bipolar Cell    Retinal Ganglion Cell              Magnocellular (M) Cells correspond mainly to rods.        Parvocellular (P) Cells correspond mainly to cones.              Optic Nerve    Optic Chiasm              Information from the left visual field in both eyes go to the right side.        Information from the right visual field in both eyes go to the left side.              Optic Tract → the name for the optic ‘nerve’ past the chiasm.    Lateral Geniculate Nucleus → 6 layers.              Layers 1-2 receive information from the M cells.        Layers 3-6 receive information from the P cells.        Projections also go to the midbrain instead of the LGN, to the superior colliculus and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (pupillary light reflex).              Optic Radiation    Primary Visual Cortex  Processing in the Primary Visual CortexRetinotopy  The retina contains an orderly representation of the visual world, which is carried forward up the visual pathway (LGN, V1, and beyond).  Retinotopy describes how the retina is mapped to a given structure.          Note that this isn’t a one-to-one representation of the visual world; there is an over-representation of the fovea, where the majority of photoreceptors are located.      Almost 50% of V1 is devoted to processing images from the area at or near the fovea.        Retinotopy in V1:            Going from superficial to deep in V1, we go from central to peripheral. In other words, the superficial regions of V1 correspond to the areas near the fovea, and the deep regions correspond to the peripheral retina.      Furthermore, below the calcarine sulcus is the region corresponding to the upper visual field, and above the calcarine sulcus is the region corresponding to the lower visual field.      Types of V1 Neurons  V1 neurons respond to specific stimulus features, such as orientation, movement, and size.  These representations can be demonstrated through neurophysiological recordings pioneered by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel (Nobel prize, 1981)            They recorded the brain of animals while they displayed visual stimuli, such as moving bars of light.      The observed neurons that would only emit action potentials from bars that were oriented vertically, for example.      From these studies, they identified 3 types of cells.        Classes of V1 Neurons          Simple Cells → respond to preferred orientation.      Complex Cells → respond to preferred orientation AND direction.      Hyper-complex Cells → respond to preferred orientation AND direction AND size.        See the below video for an example (super cool):          Simple Cell → see clip from 1:50 to 3:00.      Complex-cell → see clip from 7:15 to 8:00      Hyper-complex cell → → 9:00 to 9:35, 10:30 to 11:00        Neurons in V1      Simple Cells → respond to ORIENTATION.    Complex Cells → respond to ORIENTATION + DIRECTION.    Hyper-complex Cells → respond to ORIENTATION + DIRECTION + SIZE.    These neurons are simple feature detectors, much like the centre-surround organization seen in the retinal ganglia.  As we move further and further away from the retina, we end up seeing more complicated feature detectors (eg. face recognition, place recognition, etc),  This also relates to the nature of the deficits seen following lesions in different parts of the central visual pathways.Formation of V1 Neurons  How do these V1 neurons obtain these characteristics?          This is through the convergence of simpler feature detectors, as shown below.        SIMPLE CELLS:          Simple cells are are built by the convergence of centre-surround cells.      As mentioned before, these cells recognize edges by having the centre of the receptive field respond differently from the surrounding area.      By integrating information from a series of centre-surround cells detecting an edge, you can detect the orientation of that edge.          COMPLEX CELLS:          Complex cells are built by the convergence of centre-surround cells.      Here, by knowing the orientation of an edge at multiple points, you can observe the translation of an edge, and its rotation.      This lets you detect the direction of that edge.        HYPER-COMPLEX CELLS:          Hyper-complex cells are built by the *convergence of complex cells.      As before, by integrating information from simpler feature detectors, they can detect size.      Hypercolumns in V1  As mentioned above, the retina is projected onto V1 with the central retina projecting superficially, and the peripheral retina projecting deeply.  This ‘map’ is split up into hypercolumns, which each correspond to information from one small part of the retina.  Adjacent hypercolumns assess adjacent regions on the retina.  As was said before, this isn’t a one-to-one mapping of the visual field; the fovea is grossly overrepresented.  Structure of the Hypercolumns          Information from the LGN enters each hypercolumn at layer 4 of the cortex (as mentioned before, this was the layer that receives information).      The separate information from the L &amp; R eye then converge, via the simple and complex cells located immediately above and below layer 4.      This convergence leads to stereopsis (our sense of depth).      The mechanism behind this convergence is described right below.      Ocular Dominance Columns  80% of all V1 neurons respond to input from both eyes (binocular).          However, most respond better to one eye.      This preferential response is called ocular dominance.        Within a hypercolumn, cells with the same ocular dominance are organized into columns. These alternate across hypercolumns.          In other words, one row of hypercolumns will be left-dominant, and the adjacent row will be right-dominant.      The interface between the left-dominant row and the right-dominant row lets us compare findings between the two; this is the basis for stereopsis.      Features Derived from Hypercolumns  STEREOPSIS           As mentioned before, this is depth perception.      Obtained by the convergence of monocular cells predisposed to different eyes.      Because the ocular dominance columns alternate as described above, you get convergence at the junction points.        COLOUR           At the centre of each hypercolumn is a blob (seriously).      These blobs contain colour-sensitive double-opponent cells that let us distinguish between different shades of a colour.      Contrast this with the colour-opponent cells we saw in the retina, that let us distinguish between completely different colours, but not different shades.        ORIENTATION OF LINE SEGMENTS           Radiating from each blob are segments of simple and complex cells arranged in a pinwheel pattern.      This means that a different segment of the column will ‘light up’ when you see a feature at a specific orientation.      Clinical Aspects of V1  What happens if vision is deprived in one eye?          The image on the right shows the V1 of a normal monkey, where a tracer has been injected into one eye, and has traveled into V1.                    The white section corresponds to the region that got tracer; the black section corresponds to the region that didn’t.          Note that there is ‘zebra-striping’ of the primary visual cortex; there is even spacing between the ocular dominance columns, suggesting that both are similarly used.                    The image on the right here shows the V1 of a monkey that has been deprived of vision in one eye for 22 months.                    Here, the tracer was injected into the non-deprived eye (white), while the deprived eye had nothing injected (black).          Note that the black stripes from the deprived eye are much thinner than the white stripes. The non-deprived eye has ‘taken over’ V1.                    This suggests a USE IT OR LOSE IT phenomena; the region of cortex devoted to the side that was unused was lost.      CLINICAL CORRELATION → Amblyopia (cortical blindness).      Amblyopia  In infants, input from the two eyes compete for space in V1. If one eye sees poorly, then the dominant eye will take over.          In extreme cases, the non-dominant eye will lose all cortical representation; this leads to amblyopia (cortical blindness, or lazy eye).      Here, the issue isn’t with the afferents or efferents to the eye, but with the cortical destination of the information.        Common Treatment → PATCHING the dominant eye.          By patching the dominant eye, you give the weak eye an opportunity to ‘catch-up’.        Amblyopia is a particularly big problem in the first years of life, where V1 is particularly plastic.          It is not an issue later in life, because V1 is not nearly as plastic.      A similar deprivation in an adult (eg. a cataract in one eye) will not product amblyopia.      Strabismus  The most common cause of amblyopia is STRABISMUS.          Strabismus that is left untreated leads to amblyopia.        Strabismus → the two eyes do not align on the same image.          Here, visual acuity is normal, but there is a misalignment of the eyes, resulting in double vision.        How can strabismus lead to amblyopia?          Binocular cells are important for stereopsis (the sense of visual depth).      With strabismus, although each eye retains its V1 representation intially, binocular cells are never activated simultaneously by the same stimulus.      This is because the misalignment prevents us from observing ‘like’ features between the two eyes.      As a result, all cells eventually become monocular, and the child will permanently lose stereopsis.      Over time, ths image from one eye may actually become suppressed to get rid of the double vision, and you end up with amblyopia.        This is another example of Hebbian Plasticity:          Cells that fire together, wire together.      Without simultanous activation due to misalignment, you have no strengthening of the signal, and no development of the binocular cells.        Summary of V1        The primary visual cortex (V1) separates an image into distinct feature channels.    Different groups of cells work collectively to extract a particular feature.              Cells in blobs extract colour.        Binocular cells extract depth cues.        Simple and complex cells detect edges and simple motion.            Visual Processing Beyond V1  Higher‐order visual areas are collectively termed extra‐striate visual cortex.          From V1, information is relayed to V2, and then V3 (makes sense).      After V1, information then splays out into a host of other areas; over 3 dozen different visual areas!      Each of these different visual areas processes one unique feature; these could include facial recognition, or object recognition.      We’ll be discussing a few of these areas.      Visual Streams  After going from V1 → V2 → V3, information goes into a multitude of different areas.  However, these areas can be divided into 2 streams:          Dorsal Stream → responsible for ‘WHERE + ACTION’ processing.      Ventral Stream → responsible for ‘WHAT’ processing.        The dorsal stream, as its name suggests, projects to the dorsal surface fo the brain (posterior parietal cortex).          It selects actions depending on your position in space, and is hence the ‘where/action’ stream.      Hence, it’s involved in assessing where you are, and how you should go about doing actions based on that information.      Information going into the dorsal stream mainly comes from larger M-ganglion cells; this makes sense, since these are faster, and involved the light-sensitive rods.        The ventral stream projects to the inferior temporal lobe:          It is involved in the perception and recognition of objects (eg. faces, places, tools), and is hence the ‘what/perception’ stream.      Information going into the ventral stream mainly comes from smaller P-ganglion cells; this also makes sense, since these involve the colour sensitive cones, and the visually acute fovea.        Visual Streams for Processing      After visual information goes from V1 → V2 → V3, it splits into either a dorsal or ventral stream:                               Dorsal Stream        Ventral Stream                            Location        Dorsal (Posterior Parietal Cortex)        Ventral (Inferior Temporal Lobe)                    Function        Where/action        What (recognition)                    Source of information        M-ganglion cells        P-ganglion cells            Examples of Ventral Stream (WHAT) Regions  Lateral Occipital Cortex           Early part of the ventral stream (= WHAT).      It encodes objects (but not faces, or places; these are a separate location).      Lesions of the LOC produce visual agnosia; the inability to perceive objects through vision.      Patients can see the object’s form, and even copy it, but can’t identify the object or its use through vision.      Interestingly, the deficit is limited to vision only; patients can still identify objects by other senses (eg. they can distinguish between a knife and fork by touch).        Fusiform Face Area           Further on in the ventral stream; as its name suggests, it’s involved in face encoding.      Lesions of the FFA result in prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize faces (even their own).      Amazingly, patients can still recognize features of a face (lips, eyebrows, nose), since that’s governed by the LOC mentioned just above.      Just like before, this deficit is vision specific; patients can still recognize people by features like their voice, smell, or even their gait.      Examples of Dorsal Stream (ACTION) Regions  Area MT (Middle Temporal)           This is a key component of the dorsal stream, and it plays a role in analyzing visual motion.      A lesion of MT impairs the automatic perception of motion.      As a result, visual motion becomes a series of snap-shots.      This is pretty debilitating; won’t be able to drive, cross street, etc.        Posterior Parietal Cortex           Involved in producing actions.      Lesions of the dorsal stream at the parietal lobe produce action-based deficits.      For instance, patients with parietal lobe lesions can exhibit optic ataxia: they can recognize an object, but cannot reach to it accurately in the periphery, even though motor function is unimpaired.      So if you had an injury to your L parietal lobe (dorsal stream), you wouldn’t be able to grab something in your R visual field.      In other words, they cannot coordinate their actions with what they see on the retina. They can do the movement just fine, but they have issues guiding their hand to the right location.      Integration of the Two Streams  We have shown that:          The dorsal stream is excellent at determining the direction of motion, but is very poor at determining fine features.      The ventral stream is excellent at extracting features, but is very poor at determining aspects of motion.        Hence, information from both streams is necessary for determining what an object is, and where it’s going.  Much with much of what we’ve seen earlier, this is yet another example of division of labour and the integration of multiple discrete features.Summary  Predictable visual deficits follow lesions of the central visual pathways.  Retinotopy, found in V1 and beyond, devotes a disproportionately large area of tissue to information from the fovea.  Detection of progressively more complex visual features continues in V1 and beyond.  Stereopsis (depth perception) arises in V1 with balanced input from each eye.          Failure of this during development, perhaps due to strabismus, may result in amblyopia.        Higher‐order visual processing accomplished by two separate visual streams:.          Dorsal “action” or “where” pathway concerned with spatial aspects of an object.      Ventral “perception” or “what” pathway concerned with object recognition and perception.

	{"title": "Neurophysiology of the Eye", "text": "Lecture Overview  The next 2 lectures will focus exclusively on the neurophysiology of the visual system.          The first lecture will focus on phototransduction (the conversion of photon reception into action potentials).      The next lecture will focus on the CNS pathways that interpret visual information.      Fundamental Components of the Visual System  Eye  Retina  Optic nerves, optic chiasm, optic tract  Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)  Primary Visual Cortex (V1, or Striate Cortex)  Extrastriate Visual CortexThe EyeAnatomy of the EyeAnterior View  Pupil → the black spot in your eye through which light goes through.  Iris → what regulates the size of your pupil (via dilation or constriction).  Cornea → the transparent covering the pupil and iris.  Extraocular muscles → moves the eye around, so the most sensitive areas are pointed towards areas of interest.  Retina → a light sensitive layer of tissue covering the inside of the eye. This is where photoreception occurs.  Optic nerve → where all the sensory neurons from the retina converse and exit the eye, and head towards the brain.Cross-Section  Lens → can change shape to refract light such that an image converges directly onto the retina.  Aqueous Humour → the fluid located between the cornea and lens.  Vitreous Humour → the more gelatinous substance between the lens and retina.  Fovea → the region on your retina with the sharpest vision (the most photoreceptors are located here).Focusing Light on the Retina  As mentioned above, the lens is used to refract light such that an image converges on the retina.  When you’re looking far away, light rays are coming at a shallower angle, so the lens does not need to be too convex to focus light onto the retina.  On the other hand, when you’re looking closely at something, the lens must be more convex (‘fatter’) in order to obtain focus.  The shape of the lens is controlled by ciliary muscles, which are connected to the lens by zonule fibres.  This is why your eyes get tired when you look at close objects for a long period of time!           When the muscles are relaxed, the lens is flat. This is unaccomodated, and is used for distance points.      When the muscles are contracted, the lens becomes fat. This is accommodated, and is used for near points.        Think of the ciliary muscles like ‘purse strings’. when you pull on them, the purse gets scrunched up; and when you loosen them, the purse becomes flatter.  Remember      Unaccomodation → when the ciliary muscles are relaxed, and the lens is thus flat. This is used to look at points that are far away.    Accomodation → when the ciliary muscles are contracted, and the lens is thus fat. This is used to look at points that are close by.  Corrective Lenses  Corrective Lenses → used when you have difficulty focusing light on the retina.          Myopia → aka. near-sightedness (can focus on near images, but not distant).      Hyperopia → aka. far-sightedness (can focus on distant images, but not near).        With myopia, the lens is too ‘fat’ when looking at distant objects, so light converges anterior to the retina. In this case, a concave lens can be used to diverge the light such that it hits the retina precisely.  Similarly, with hyperopia, the lens is too ‘flat’ when looking at close objects, so light converges posterior to the retina. In this case, a convex lens can be used to refocus the light.  As you age, your lens becomes less elastic, and remains too flat for near images, even when the ciliary muscles are completely contracted.  When this happens, images of near objects are blurred, and reading glasses are required.  What happens when myopic people get older, and also can’t see close objects?            If you’re near-sighted when you’re younger, and then begin losing your close-up vision, what can you do?      If you stuck with corrective lenses as above, you’d have to constantly change from a concave to convex lens when changing from far to close vision!      This is when bifocal glasses are useful (invented by Ben Franklin).      With bifocal glasses, the top half is more concave for looking at distant objects, and the bottom half is more convex for looking at close objects.      The Iris and the Pupillary Light Reflex  The iris contricts in bright light, so that the pupil becomes smaller and fewer rays of light enter.  This is termed the pupillary light reflex, and it functions to prevent the light-sensitive photoreceptors from being saturated by too much light.  Reducing the pupil diamater can also help sharpen an image, much like how narrowing the aperture on a camera increases the depth of field.  In order for the reflex to function, you need a normal afferent signal (via the optic nerve), and a normal efferent signal (via the oculomotor nerve).          Hence, the direct and consensual reflexes are a good test to assess CN II &amp; III.      The RetinaCell Types of the Retina  There are 5 cell types in the retina:            Photoreceptors → 2 types:                  Rods → light-sensitive.          Cones → colour-senstive (3 types, 1 per primary colour).          Mnemonic: C goes with C (cones, colour).                    Ganglion Cells → there are the only cells that actually produce action potentials.                  Hence, the ganglion cells function as the output neurons, whose axons comprise the optic nerve.                    Bipolar Cells → connect the photo-receptors and the ganglion cells.                  Hence, these connect the cells that receive the signal to the cells that output it.          Recall that we saw these in Introduction to Neuroanatomy, in contrast to multipolar and unipolar neurons.                    Horizontal Cells      Amacrine Cells        The horizontal and amacrine cells are responsible for some degree of image processing; this actually begins in the retina, and not the brain.          This is termed lateral information flow.        Remember      There are 5 cell types in the retina:              Photoreceptors → rods + cones.        Bipolar Cells → connect photoreceptors to ganglion cells.        Ganglion Cells → output the signal via the optic nerve.        Horizontal Cells        Amacrine Cells.              A signal travels from the photoreceptors → bipolar cell → ganglion cell, up the optic disc.    Horizontal cells and amacrine cells regulate the activity of multiple photoreceptor cells, and allow for some degree of image processing.  Phototransduction  Phototransduction is the process that converts light energy (photons) into neural signals.  Rods and cones have photo‐sensitive molecules in the outer segment that are sensitive to particular wavelengths of light.  Arrival of an appropriate photon triggers an amplifying cascade which produces a receptor potential in the photoreceptor. This amplification makes the receptors so sensitive that we can see a flash from a single photon.  Absorption of a photon triggers a molecular cascade that closes Na+ channels.          Less Na+ in results in hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor, releasing less neurotransmitter at the other end of the photoreceptor (the inner segment).        Darkness does the opposite; it opens the Na+ channels.          More Na+ flooding in results in depolarization of the receptor, releasing more neurotransmitter on the other end.        THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU’D EXPECT.          In most systems, you’d effect a stimulus to lead to depolarization; here it actually leads to hyperpolarization.      Cones vs Rods  Cones are primarily found at the fovea, the part of the retina that we use to see with high detail.          Cones are responsible for colour vision, but are less sensitive to light (they have a smaller outer segment, where photo-sensitive pigment is located).      At the fovea, there are exclusively cones; there aren’t any rods. Hence, we see colours best at the fovea.        Rods are primarily found at the peripheral retina.          Rods are responsible for light sensitivity; they have a larger outer segment, and hence are more sensitive to light.      Hence, we can see light okay throughout the retina, except for the fovea.        Because the fovea has no rods, you can actually see dimmer things better when you don’t directly focus on them, and instead keep them in your periphery. You can try this when you’re looking at dim stars while star-gazing.  Cones vs Rods                             Cones        Rods                            Function        Colour Sensitivity        Light Sensitivity                    Primary Location        Fovea        Peripheral Retina                    Size        Smaller (small outer segment)        Larger (large outer segment)            Finding your Blind Spot  At the optic nerve, there are no photo-receptors; hence this is a blind spot.          Recall that light has to travel through the other cells in order to hit the photo-receptors.      Because of that, where the axons of the ganglion cells converge to form the optic nerve, no light can pass through.      Normally this isn’t an issue, because we have 2 eyes, and the blind spots don’t overlap.      When we close our eyes, the blind spot does appear, but our brain masks it by ‘filling in the gap’.        We can see this with the demonstration on the right:            Close your right eye, and focus on the ‘X’ at the right.      Move your screen closer to you until the circle disappears.      At this point, the light from the circle is hitting the optic nerve, where there aren’t any photoreceptors; this causes it to disappear (whoaaa).        We can also assess how the brain ‘fills in’ the gap:            Do the same thing now, except this time, note that the space where the dot was is now black.      In other words, the brain filled in the blind spot with the background colour!      Visual Acuity at the Fovea  As mentioned before, the fovea only contains cones, and is thus highly sensitive to colour.  THIS IS ALSO THE AREA OF THE EYE WITH THE HIGHEST VISUAL ACUITY.  There are a few reasons for this.          Fewer cells to travel through                   At the fovea, the cells that normally lie on top of the photoreceptors (bipolar cells, ganglia cells), are pushed to the side.          This is why the fovea is a pit; the cells on top are pushed to the margins of the fovea.          Since there are fewer things blocking the photoreceptors, light scatters less, and our visual acuity improves.                    Ganglion cells at the fovea have a smaller receptive field                  A ganglion cell at the peripheral retina receives converging information from many widely-spaced photoreceptors. This produces a large receptive field (~3° of visual angle).          In contrast, a ganglion cell at the fovea receives convering information from a few closely-packed photoreceptors. This produces a small receptive field (~0.3° of visual angle).          As a result, when 2 photons about a degree apart hit photoreceptors at the periphery, they’ll feed to a single ganglion cell, which will only register 1 point of light.          On the other hand, when the same happens at the fovea, since the receptive field is narrower, you’ll see 2 points of light.          This is a similar idea to how the body has different 2-point discrimination at the hands versus the legs (the hands are more sensitive to touch).                     Retinal Ganglion CellsDon’t confuse these with the magnocellular and parvocellular neurons we saw in Endocrinology, which come from the hypothalamus innervate the pituitary. Magno- just means big, and parvo- just means small; there’s no association.  As mentioned before, the retinal ganglion cells are the cells that ultimately output a signal to the brain.  These retinal ganglion cells fall into 2 main classes.            P-cells (Parvocellular Cells)                  Sensitive to colour, so mainly receive from cones.          Smaller receptive fields (as mentioned above).          Smaller, slower conducting.          Comprise 90% of ganglion cells (most of our ganglion cells are concentrated at the fovea).                    M-cells (Magnocellular Cells)                  Not sensitive to coour, mainly receive from rods.          Larger receptive fields.          Larger, faster conducting.          5-10% of all ganglion cells.          Best activated by transient, moving stimuli (this makes sense, since they largely receive from our peripheral vision).                      Because the two ganglion cells largely receive different types of inputs, we are already extracting different features from the world at the level of the retina.          As we move up the visual pathway, we’ll see how more and more complex feature extraction works.      These cell types also project to different layers of the LGN (recall, lateral geniculate nucleus, part of thalamus that receives vision), which reflects a compartmentalization that we see throughout the visual system.        P-cells vs M-cells                             Parvocellular (P) Cells        Magnocellular (M) Cells                            Receives from        Cones (colour)        Rods (light)                    Size        Small (hence parvo-)        Large (hence magno-)                    Receptive Field        Small        Large                    Conduction speed        Slower        Faster                    Additional features        Comprise 90% of ganglion cells        Best activated by transient, moving stimuli            Why is it difficult to read in low Illumination?  You usually use your fovea to read; the region of the eye with the most visual acuity.  However, the fovea is also less sensitive to light, so in dim lighting, you have to rely more on your peripheral retina.  Hence, you have to rely on your less acute regions of vision to read (another way of illustrating this: try reading an entire line of text without moving your eyes; you should see how the acuity falls off with increasing distance from the fovea).Assessing Vision  In summary, at the fovea, we have the most visual acuity and sensitivity to colour, but poorer sensitivity to light.  In contrast, in the periphery, we have the least visual acuity and colour sensitivity, but the most sensitivity to light.  When we assess vision, our tests reflect this:          Letter Chart (Snellen Chart)                  Done to assess visual acuity, so we test the fovea.          Hence, it’s done in bright light, and you’re allowed to move your eyes to focus light onto the fovea.                    Visual Field Test                  Done to assess the function of the rods in the periphery.          Here, you fixate on one point, so you have to rely on your peripheral vision.          The patient presses a button whenever they see a flash in the periphery (hence, only light sensitivity is assessed).          Areas of the visual field that do not elicit a button press are called scotomas (blind spots), and indicate a visual deficit.                    Colour Vision  We have 3 cones; their names correspond to the wavelength at which they have peak sensitivity (red, green, blue).  However, the absorption spectrum for each is actually quite wide, and they can overlap. This overlap helps differentiate more subtle hues.  Since we have 3 types of cones, we have trichromatic vision.Colour Blindness  2% of males lack the red or green pigment          They are referred to as red-green colour blind, and are dichromats, since they only have 2 types of cones.      They would not be able to see the number on the right, because the only difference between the red and green in the image is hue (they have the same intensity).        6% of males have all 3 pigments, but the green pigment is shifted towards the red one.          These are referred to as anomalous trichromats; they are trichromats, but they aren’t as sensitive to differences between red and green as the general population.        Hence, in total, about 8% of the male population has some form of colour blindness, as opposed to only about 0.5% of females.          This is because it often has an X-linked inheritance pattern.        Dichromats (2%) are missing one cone type,  Monochromats (rare) are missing two cone types,  Achromats (very rare) are missing all cone types.Visual Processing in the RetinaProcessing Changes in Intensity  We saw that multiple photoreceptors converse to a single ganglion cell.  However, this wasn’t the complete story; photoreceptors that connect to the same ganglion cell are NOT treated in the same way.  In fact, their response to light input can be inhibitory or excitatory depending on the location of the photo-receptor on their receptive field.  More formally, they have a centre-surround organization, which is mediated by the actions of the bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells (which we mentioned before).          What this means is that the centre of the receptive field is treated differently as the surrounding area.      Centre-surround organization can either be on-centre or off-centre.        On-centre → where the centre of the receptive field is stimulated by light (hence it’s turned ‘on’), and the surrounding area is inhibited.  Off-centre → the opposite, where the centre of the receptive field is inhibited by light (hence it’s turned ‘off’), and the surrounding area is stimulated.  Why is a centre-surround organization useful?    (Random aside) This idea is similar to how you convolve a signal with a Laplacian of a Gaussian filter in image processing!          It allows you to ACCENTUATE EDGES!      When you cross an edge where one side is dark, and the other side is bright, you can stimulate both the centre and the surrounding area of the receptive field in the same way.      This gives you a more accentuated stimulatory or inhibitory effect.      Artists actually exploit this by darkening one side of an edge, and lightening the other.      This is also why we see illusory ‘bands’ around edges, where the darker side of the edge looks darker than the surrounding area, and vice versa.        Center‐surround also aids in constancy, by measuring the change across an edge, rather than absolute light levels.  This helps letters on a page stand out whether you are indoors in dim light or outdoors in bright sun.  This occurs despite the background indoors being darker than the letter outdoors!Processing Changes in Hue  With cones, we have a similar organization with colour-opponent cells.  In these cells, the presence of a specific wavelength in the surrounding area inhibits the response to another wavelength in the centre.  Hence, this helps detect edges between colours (different wavelengths).  However, it does a poor job of detecting edges between similar colours (similar wavelengths); this is something that the primary visual cortex plays a role in.3 Diseases of the Eye  Cataracts → clouding of the lens.          Here, vision everywhere is affected equally, because the clouding results in blurring of the light in a uniform manner.        Glaucoma → disorders that result in optic nerve damage.          Most typically caused by increased intraocular pressure.      The periphery is affected more because you have fewer axons there; this results in tunnel vision.        Macular Degeneration → deposits underneath the retina affect vision.          These deposits (fatty/blood vessels), predominantly affect the fovea first.      As a result, we lose central vision first.      These deposits also distort the retinal sheath, resulting in image distortion.        Summary of the Eye      The eye does three things:              It focuses the image on the retina. Image focus depends on lens shape, pupil diameter, shape (length) of eye, lens clarity, and if the image lands on the fovea.        It detects light of various colours and intensities        It compresses the information in order to send it down the optic nerve. Compressions occurs by:                      A detailed image is sent only from a small part of the eye, which is the fovea.            Through retinal processing of an image, we’re particularly sensitive to edges.                                What the eye sends the brain is a poor reflection of the original image, yet we perceive our visual world with clarity. This is done by the visual cortex, the topic of the next lecture  ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/18/neurophysiology-eye.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Neurophysiology", "text": "Introduction to the Brain  Much of this lecture is review, but it aims to bring everyone onto the same page for subsequent lectures.  An adult human brain contains 100 billion neurons, and 10x as many glia cells.          Gray Matter → neurons.      White Matter → axons.        Just like the 6-degrees of separation concept, there are at most 4 degrees of separation between any pair of neurons in the brain.  If you took all the white matter in the brain, and strung it end to end, you’d have something that’s several million miles in total length.          Hence, sending action potentials across this massive network is energetically expensive; only a small percentage of neurons are active at any one time.      The brain, which is only 1-3% of your total body mass, actually uses 20% of the body’s energy.      You would faint due to a lack of oxygen if more than 5% of your neurons were active at the same time!      Because of how hungry the brain is for energy, and decreases in oxygenation will often present with neurological findings first!        When a certain part of your gray matter is in use, blood is directed preferentially to that region.            This is the basis for fMRI (functional MRI) → deoxyhemoglobin is used as a contrast agent in order to visualize areas with high blood flow.      This lets you indirectly assess regions of high neurological activity.        Another method of imaging is Diffusion Tensor Imaging, which reveals the ‘connectome’ between the neurons in the brain.            This is useful in assessing conditions such as epilepsy, where a locus of abnormal activity can spread through these connections to other areas, resulting in a seizure.      Both fMRI and DTI have exploded in popularity for both basic and clinical research, and will continue to do so in the coming years.        Remember      fMRI (functional MRI) → assesses cortical activity indirectly, via blood flow.    DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) → assesses axonal connectivity.    NEUROMYTH → You only use 10% of your brain.          Myth → 90% of your brain power is just waiting to be untapped.      Origin is somewhat unclear:                  May have started from a misinterpretation of the works of William James by Dale Carnegie, who wrote the preface to Carnegie’s self-help book How to Win Friends and Influence People.          Could also have been a misinterpretation of the works of Karl Lashley and Wilder Penfield at the MNI (large areas of “silent” cortex are non-responsive to electrical stimulation).          May also be related to the 10:1 glia-to-neuron ratio (glial cells are any non-neuronal cells that supports/helps the neuron)                    Reality:                  FALSE; you use 100% of your brain!          The brain uses all available neural tissue, as has been verified by fMRI studies.          While not all of the brain is functioning at the same time, all of it is used.          Furthermore, minor brain damage can have devastating effects, which wouldn’t make sense if only 10% of your brain was being used.          “Silent” cortex is not so silent after all; newer studies show that these areas are functional.          Why would we evolve something we don’t use?                    Review of The Neuron  Neuron → the physiological functional unit of the nervous system.  Neurons and muscle cells are excitable; they can generate and respond to electrical signals.  Components of the Neuron:          Soma → cell body.      Axon → sends information via action potentials.      Dendrite → receives and integrates information.      Synapse → point of contact between neurons.        Neurons have a resting membrane potential of about -65 mV.          Depolarization → less negative than resting potential.      Hyperpolarization → more negative than resting potential.        Action potentials start at the axon hillock (the junction between the axon and the cell body), and continue all the way down to the axon terminal.          Once a threshold is reached, the action potential goes to completion; hence this is an all-or-none signal.      Propagation is accelerated by myelination, which permits skipping of the action potential from one Node of Ranvier to another (saltatory conduction).      Multiple Sclerosis → an example of a demyelinating disease of the CNS.                  Another example is Guillain-Barré syndrome, which affects the PNS.                      Remember      Multiple Sclerosis → demyelinating disease of the CNS.    Guillain-Barré Syndrome → demyelinating disease of the PNS.  Coding Sensory Information  This all-or-none concept is important with respect to the brain.          This means that the inputs to the brain are effectively only a series of 0s or 1s.      From this, how do you get such fine-grained perceptions of the world?        Some examples are listed below:          Frequency Coding → where the frequency of action potential firing is used to interpret stimulus. For instance, a soft stimulus will have slow axon potential firing, while a hard stimulus will have fast firing.      Population Coding → where the population of neurons that are firing is used to interpret stimulus.      Duration Coding → where the duration of the action potential firing is used to interpret stimulus.      Labeled Line Coding → information about sensory modality is conveyed along dedicated sensory pathways. (e.g., information sent through the optic nerve is interpreted as vision-related).      Circuit Principles  Convergence           Axonal branches of many neurons reach one target neuron for comparison or integration.      Relevant in sensory neuroscience for feature extraction.        Divergence           Axonal branches of one neuron reach many target neurons.      Relevant in motor control to ensure coordinate actions, and the contextual control of reflexes.        Remember      Convergence is important in the sensory system for feature extraction.    Divergence is important in the motor system for coordinating actions.  Chemical Synapses  SIGNAL INITIATION → Arrival of the action potential at the axon terminal triggers Ca2+ mediated release of a neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft:          Examples of neurotransmitters: Acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, etc.        SIGNAL RECEPTION → The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, producing a response.          These receptors can be grouped into 2 broad classes → ionotropic and metabotropic.                  Ionotropic → binding opens ion channels (fast action, local effects).          Metabotropic → actions are mediated through a second-messenger system (more widespread, longer-lasting effects). The canonical example are the GPCRs.                      SIGNAL TERMINATION → once the signal has been triggered, it also has to be stopped.          The method of termination differs depending on the neurotransmitter. Examples include (1) diffusion, (2) enzymatic destruction, or (3) re-uptake.      For instance, with acetylcholine, the ACh signal was broken down via acetylcholinesterase.        Receptor Subtypes      Ionotropic → binding opens ion channels, for fast &amp; local effects.    Metabotropic → binding triggers a downstream cascade, for widespread &amp; longer-lasting effects.  Ionotropic Responses  As mentioned above, these are fast, local effects.  EPSPs → Excitatory Post Synaptic Potentials.          Where the post-synaptic membrane is depolarized.      The major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain is glutamate.      The excitatory neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction is acetylcholine.      The NMDA receptors for glutamate are modifiable; this allows for synaptic plasticity (strengthening or weakening of the post-synaptic response). This is the foundation of learning and memory.          IPSPs → Inhibitory Post Synaptic Potentials.          Where the post-synaptic membrane is hyperpolarized.      The major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is GABA (GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid).      The inhibitory neurotransmitter at the spinal cord is glycine.      Many sedating or tranquilizing drugs target GABA receptors.          Summary of Ionotropic Responses                             EPSP (Excitatory)        IPSP (Inhibitory)                            Definition        Where the post-synaptic membrane is depolarized.        Where the post-synaptic membrane is hyperpolarized                    Corresponding Neurotransmitter(s)        Brain → glutamateNMJ → acetylcholine        Brain → GABASpinal Cord → glycine              Synaptic Integration → multiple EPSPs and IPSPs can be summed up over space (spatial summation) and time (temporal summation) by the downstream neuron.          The net effect of the EPSPs and IPSPs may or may not be enough to trigger a downstream action potential; this is how multiple signals are integrated.       Metabotropic Responses  As mentioned above, these are longer-lasting, widespread effects.  With metabotropic receptors, actions are mediated through a second messenger system.  For example, G-protein coupled receptors can alter cellular metabolism, regulate ion channel function, or trigger widespread metabolic effects. This is another pathway for synaptic plasticity.  Examples include receptors for dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.  The systems that govern our emotions are largely controlled by metabotropic responses.Neuropharmacology  There are many neurotransmitters (&gt; 50 at last count), but they generally fall into 3 categories:          Amino Acids → eg. GABA, glutamate, glycine.      Amines → Acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.      Peptides → Substance P (associated with pain &amp; inflammation), dynorphin (opioid).        Drugs that affect the brain affect the receptors for these transmitters, or how they get eliminated.Examples of Neuroreceptors  We’ll be looking at two neat neuroreceptors:          GABAA receptor.      NMDA receptor.      1. GABAA Receptor  GABAA Receptor → inhibitory ionotropic receptor in the brain.          Recall that we saw previously that GABA was the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.        One GABA receptor is the GABAA receptor.  On this receptor, there are multiple binding sites, for different agonists.          Some of these include ethanol, barbituates, and benzodiazepines.      That’s why all of these make you sleepy. They all stimulate an inhibitory receptor!      Since they also bind to different regions on the receptor, they can have multiplicative effects; this is why it’s dangerous to be on benzodiazepines and drink, for instance.        Many drugs also act on other receptors:          For instance, alcohol also antagonizes the glutamate receptors; recall that glutamate has an excitatory effect in the brain.      Hence, the depressive/sedating effect of alcohol is through two mechanisms → upregulation of inhibitory GABAA receptor activity, and downregulation of excitatory glutamate receptor activity.      2. NMDA Receptor  NMDA Receptor → excitatory ionotropic receptor in the brain. receptor for glutamate.          Recall that we saw previously that glutamate was the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.        The NMDA receptor has a neat feature → the receptor only opens if the cell is already depolarized.          This allows it to be used as a COINCIDENCE DETECTOR; it detects whether multiple excitatory signals are firing at the same time.      This coincidence detector then adjusts synaptic strength, so that synapses that fire together are strengthened.                  Hebbian Learning → cells that fire together, wire together          In other words, the NMDA receptor allows for the detection of signals that are firing in synchrony, allowing for strengthening of synapses that fire together, and the pruning of those that don’t.          Hence, this plays an important role in learning and plasticity.                    Hebbian learning is important in the development of stereopsis (depth perception).        NEUROMYTH → The brain is only plastic during critical periods.          Myth → for example, the first 3 years of a child’s life are decisive for later brain development and success.      Origin:                  Pioneering studies in animal behaviour on imprinting (e.g., in birds right after hatching)          Visual experience early in life determines how much of the visual cortex is devoted to processing input from each eye.                    Reality                   ONLY PARTIALLY TRUE. Although it’s true that the first 3 years of life are important for the development of some neurological systems (eg. sensory modalities), it is not generalizable to all learning.          The human brain retains plasticity throughout life. eg, recovery can follow brain damage, and new capacities can be learned throughout life (eg, London UK cab drivers have enlarged hippocampi, which plays a role in spatial memory).          Even in the sensory domains, the concept of a “critical period” is not so sharply defined (a better term may be “sensitive period”).                    Brodmann’s Areas  Gray matter consists of 6 anatomically distinct layers.            Information is received in layer 4.      Information is output in layers 3 &amp; 5.Recall that the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus relays sensory information to the primary visual cortex.        Hence, regions of the cortex that receive lots of information will have a thick layer 4; one example is the primary visual cortex.          In fact, the primary visual cortex is also called the striate cortex because of it’s thick layer 4.        Similarly, regions of the cortex that send lots of information will have thick layers 3 &amp; 5; one example is the primary motor cortex.  These cytological and histological differences are the basis for Brodmann’s Areas          More than 100 years ago, K Brodmann used differences in these cortical features to subdivide the brain into 52 different regions.      Examples include area 17 (the striate cortex), and area 4 (the primary motor cortex).      Continuing research shows that each area may even have functional subdivisions (eg. 3a, 3b, etc).        KEY POINT → different areas of the brain do different things, and these patterns of distribution are largely reproducible between people.            The classic example was the case of Phineas Gage, who was an American railway worker who had a tamping iron driven through his frontal lobe after an explosion.      Upon recovery, personality changes were observed, which suggested that different regions of the cortex had different functions.      Although he was considered the “index case” for personality changes due to frontal lobe damage, it’s now recognized that many of the behavioural claims were exaggerated to fit pet theories.

	{"title": "Basal Ganglia &amp; Diencephalon", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Identify the main structures that comprise the basal ganglia.  Compare the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways of the basal ganglia.  Know the major subdivisions of the thalamus, their main connections and primary function.  Describe the location and major functions of the hypothalamus and epithalamus.Review of the Cerebrum  Components of the Cerebrum:          Cerebral Cortex (Gray Matter)                  Superficial cortical layer of gray matter containing neuronal cell bodies                    Cerebral White Matter                  Deeper layer of white matter containing fibers connecting cell bodies to other cortical areas and the rest of the brain                    Deep Gray Matter                  Comprises the basal ganglia; the deepest layer of large collections of neuronal cell bodies.                    Basal Ganglia  Basal Ganglia → deep layer of neuronal cell bodies located in the cerebrum (deep gray matter).          Shown in pink on the right.      Note that this is c-shaped; as we discussed in Anatomy of the Cerebrum, the cerebrum develops embryologically as a c-shape.      Since the basal ganglia is part of the cerebrum, it follows this shape as well.      In coronal sections, since the caudate nucleus sort of loops around a bit, you can often see it represented twice.        Objective      Identify the main structures that comprise the basal ganglia.    Anatomically, it consists of the following:            Caudate nucleus.      Putamen.      Globus pallidus.      Amygdala.        Lentiform nucleus → refers to the putamen + globus pallidus.  Thalamus → just medial to the lentiform nucleus.  Caudate nucleus → has 3 parts: (1) Head, (2) Body, (3) Tail.  Amygdala → Although many anatomical texts refer to the amygdala as a separate structure, anatomically it should be considered part of the basal ganglia.          As can be seen on the right, this is a round structure on the tail of the caudate nucleus. (recall that cauda = tail).      The amygdala is part of the limbic system, which governs our emotions.        Functions of the Basal Ganglia:          Motor → coordinate speed and strength of movements.      Cognition, learning, emotions.        Today, we’ll be focusing primarily on the motor function of the basal ganglia.          This is what’s most applicable clinically; dysfunctions in the basal ganglia lead to movement disorders.      Anatomic Location of the Basal Ganglia  Below are coronal and transverse (horizontal) cross-sections of the brain.  Note that the insular cortex can easily be seen here as the gray matter that is covered by the parietal and temporal lobes.  Below is an coronal section at an anterior location on the basal ganglia.  Note that we don’t see the thalamus here:          This is because the thalamus is posteromedial relative to the lentiform nucleus, so it’s posterior to the level at which the cross section was taken (see right).        Note the anatomy of the lentiform nucleus:          The Putamen is more lateral.      The Globus pallidus is more medial.        Below is a transverse (horizontal) section through the basal ganglia.          Here, you can actually see the head of the caudate nucleus, and where it attaches to the lentiform nucleus.      You don’t see the body of the caudate because it’s superior to the level of the cross section.      But you do see the tail as the ‘C’ curves back into the plane.      You can also see the thalamus more medially (the unlabelled midline gray matter).        Note that the globus pallidus has 2 parts, which are involved in different motor control pathways.:          External      Internal        Anatomic Components of the Basal Ganglia      Basal Ganglia → putamen + globus pallidus + caudate nucleus + amygdala.    Lentiform Nucleus → globus pallidus + putamen.    Striatum → putamen + caudate nucleus.    Lentiform nucleus is comprised of 2 more functionally dissimilar parts (putamen and globus pallidus).    Striatum is comprised of 2 more functionally similar parts (putamen + caudate nucleus).    The Role of the Basal Ganglia in Motor Control  In Anatomy of the Cerebrum, we saw the different CNS centres that participate in motor control, including:  The ideomotor area was located in the Posterior Multimodal Assocation Area, where all of our sensory information is integrated.          Ideomotor area → where you get the idea to move.      Premotor Cortex → planning of complex motions.      Primary Motor Cortex → located on the precentral gyrus.        There are 3 more systems that are very important for motor control, including:          Basal ganglia.      Cerebellum.      Spinal reflexes.        Today we’ll be focusing on the basal ganglia, which will provide a good foundation on the anatomy and structure for a subsequent TBL.Direct &amp; Indirect Striopallidal Pathways  Objective      Compare the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways of the basal ganglia.    As we saw previously, the primary motor cortex sends commands down to the spinal cord, and eventually to the muscles.          However, these commands are modulated by other structures, including the basal ganglia.      For the basal ganglia, this regulation ensures that the motor cortex is set at an appropriate level of activity (ie. initiating movements at the right strength &amp; speed).        There are 2 pathways through the basal ganglia, which regulate the primary motor cortex:          Direct Striopallidal Pathway.      Indirect Striopallidal Pathway.        As their names suggest, they go through the striatum (caudate nucleus + putamen), and the globus pallidus.  Direct Striopallidal Pathway          This is a direct pathway of feedback, via the internal globus pallidus.      Pathway: INPUT from motor cortex → striatum → internal globus pallidus → thalamus → motor cortex regulation.      RED = inhibitory connections.      GREEN = excitatory connections.      Hence, the net result is excitatory feedback to the motor cortex:                  You can think of this as multiplying (+1)’s and (-1)’s for excitatory and inhibitory signals respectively.          Since there are 2 (+1) connections, and 2 (-1) connections, the net result is an excitatory feedback.                    An easy way to remember the connections is to note that any connection leaving a structure in the basal ganglia is inhibitory:                  Hence any connection leaving the striatum, and internal/external globus pallidus, will be inhibitory.          Everything else is excitatory.                      Indirect Striopallidal Pathway          This is an indirect pathway of feedback, via the external globus pallidus.                  Here, there is an extra structure involved, called the subthalamic nucleus (part of the diencephalon).          Instead of going directly into the internal globus pallidus, the pathway first goes through the external globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus.                    Pathway: INPUT from motor cortex → striatum → external globus pallidus → subthalamic nucleus → internal globus pallidus → thalamus → motor cortex regulation.      Hence, the net result is inhibitory feedback to the motor cortex.        Through these two pathways, tone and activity for the motor cortex can be maintained.          Also shown in the above figure is the substantia nigra; which has a dopamine influence on the striatum, and also affects the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways.      This is important because the substantia nigra is the area that’s affected in Parkinson’s Disease.        Striopallidal Pathways      The DIRECT striopallidal pathway gives EXCITATORY feedback to the primary motor cortex.              It goes through the internal globus pallidus directly.              The INDIRECT striopallidal pathway gives INHIBITORY feedback to the primary motor cortex.              It goes through the external globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, before going into the internal globus pallidus.              To remember this, note that the two ‘I’s go together (indirect + inhibitory).  Disorders of the Basal Ganglia  Parkinson’s Disease → a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.          Results in understimulation of the motor cortex.      Symptoms include slow jerky movements, muscle rigidity, slow tremors, and bradykinesia (slow movement).        Huntington’s Disease → neuronal atrophy of the striatum (caudate nucleus + putamen).          In particular, this is a loss in the intrinsic inhibitory neurons, resulting in overstimulation of the motor cortex.      Symptoms are choreiform movements (brisk, jerky, purposeless movements of the limbs).        Schizophrenia → changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.          The nucleus accumbens is the basal part of the striatum, which connects to the lateral prefrontal cortex.      The nucelus accumbens is involved in motivational states and addictive behaviours.      Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, and disorded thoughts.      There is also often a deficit of normal emotional responses.        Disorders of the Basal Ganglia                    Disease        Cause        Symptoms                            Parkinson’s Disease        Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra        Slow jerky movements, muscle rigidity, slow tremors, bradykinesia                    Huntington’s Disease        Loss of the intrinsic inhibitory neurons in the striatum        Choreiform movements: brisk, jerky, purposeless movements of the limbs                    Schizophrenia        Changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which connects to the lateral prefrontal cortex        Delusions, hallucination, disordered thoughts, deficit of normal emotional responses            Diencephalon  The diencephalon is comprised of 4 structures:          Thalamus      Hypothalamus      Epithalamus = Pineal      Subthalamus (includes subthalamic nucleus)        So everything in the diencephalon is defined by their relation to the thalamus.          The difference between hypothalamus and the subthalamus is that the hypothalamus is below the thalamus, while the subthalamus is at the base of the thalamus.        We saw the subthalamus and thalamus previously as part of the striopallidal pathways:          Both the direct and indirect pathway went through the thalamus.      The indirect pathway also went through the subthalamic nucleus (in the subthalamus).        Anatomically, the thalamus lies below the fibres of the corpus callosum, and lies in the midline of the brain.          However, even though it’s midline, the thalamus is a paired structure; there is a L and R thalamus.      The L &amp; R thalamus are mostly separated by the third ventricle, and are joined only by an area called the interthalamic adhesion.        The pineal gland (aka. epithalamus) is not only superior to the thalamus, but also posterior.  Above the thalamus is another important structure called the fornix, which plays an important role in the limbic system.  Above is the horizontal cross-section which we saw previously.  Note that the thalamus is the midline region of grey matter, that lies just medial to the globus pallidus and putamen.  Summary of the Diencephalon      The diencephalon includes:              Thalamus.        Hypothalamus.        Epithalamus (Pineal)        Subthalamus.              Of these, the thalamus is the largest, and is a midline structure comprised of two lobes connected by a midline interthalamic adhesion.  Subdivisions of the Thalamus  The thalamus connects to many parts of the cortex; you can think of it as a hub/relay for information going towards the cortex.          It also acts to filter the information that goes into the brain.        Hence, there are many subdivisions of the thalamus, which associate with different parts of the cortex.Categories of the Thalamic Nuclei  There are multiple nuclei in the thalamus, with different functions.  We categorize the nuclei in the thalamus by the cortical areas that they associate with.  Hence, as with the cortex, there are thalamic nuclei associated with:          Sensory      Motor      Association      Names of the Thalamic Nuclei  While the thalamic nuclei are categorized functionally, they’re named based on their anatomic location within the thalamus.  For example:          VA → Ventral Anterior Nucleus.      MD → Medial Dorsal Nucleus.      VPL → Ventral Posterior Lateral Nucleus.        Objective      Know the major subdivisions of the thalamus, their main connections and primary function.  Sensory Subdivisions of the Thalamus  There is a thalamic subdivision associated with every sensory modality in the cortex, with one exception.          OLFACTION GOES DIRECTLY INTO THE CEREBRAL CORTEX.      So every other sensory modality is relayed through the thalamus, with the exception of smell.        We’ll only be focusing on a subset of the sensory nuclei.  Examples of Sensory Nuclei:            Auditory Pathway → Medial Geniculate Body → Primary auditory cortex on superior temporal lobe.      Optic Tract → Lateral Geniculate Body → Primary visual cortex on the occipital lobe (either side of the calcarine sulcus).      Somesthetic from body → VPL (ventral posterior lateral) → primary somatosensory cortex in postcentral gyrus.      Somesthetic from head → VPM (ventral posterior medial) → primary somatosensory cortex in postcentral gyrus.        Sensory Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Associated Sense        Receives From        Goes To                            Medial Geniculate Body        Hearing        Auditory Pathway        Primary Auditory Cortex (superior temporal lobe)                    Lateral Geniculate Body        Vision        Optic Tract        Primary Visual Cortex (occipital lobe, either side of calcarine sulcus)                    VPL (Ventral Postero-lateral)        Somatosensory        Sensory innervation from BODY        Primary Somatosensory Cortex (post-central gyrus)                    VPM (Ventral Postero-medial)        Somatosensory        Sensory innervation from HEAD        Primary Somatosensory Cortex (post-central gyrus)            Motor Subdivisions of the Thalamus  Just like how sensory information from the rest of the body is relayed through the thalamus, motor output from the brain also goes through the thalamus.          We’ve already seen an example of this with the striopallidal pathways, which feed through the thalamus.        Examples of Motor Relay Nuclei:          VA (Ventral Anterior) → receives input from the globus pallidus (via the direct/indirect striopallidal pathways), and feeds back to the motor cortex.      VL (Ventral Lateral) → receives input from the cerebellum, and feeds back to the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex.        Motor Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Receives From        Goes To                            VA (Ventral Anterior)        Globus pallidus        Primary Motor Cortex                    VL (Ventral Lateral)        Cerebellum        Primary Motor Cortex &amp; Premotor Cortex            Association Subdivisions of the Thalamus  The association nuclei connect to some of the associations areas we saw in previous lectures.  Examples of Association Nuclei:          Anterior Nucleus → receives input from the limbic system (mammillary bodies), outputs to the cingulate gyrus.      MD Nucleus (Medial Dorsal) → receives input from the amygdala, outputs to the prefrontal cortex (~AMAA).      Pulvinar Nucleus → outputs to the parietal cortex (~PMAA).        Association Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Receives From        Goes To                            Anterior Nucleus        Limbic System (mammillary bodies)        Cingulate Gyrus                    MD (Medial Dorsal)        Amygdala        Prefrontal Cortex (~AMAA)                    Pulvinar Nucleus                 Parietal Cortex (~PMAA)            Hypothalamus &amp; Pituitary Gland  Objective      Describe the location and major functions of the hypothalamus and epithalamus.    The hypothalamus is like the thalamus in that it has a number of sub-nuclei, which each have different functions.          It controls thirst, temperature, satiety, and neuroendocrine release (through the pituitary).      It also integrates with the limbic system to mediate an autonomic response to an emotional stimulus (eg. how you start sweating when you’re afraid).        We won’t be looking at this in detail in this block (most of this was covered in Endocrinology).The Epithalamus (Pineal Gland)  The epithalamus looks like a little tail popping out from the back of the thalamus.  Primarily responsible for circadian rhythms by secreting melatonin at night.  It knows that it’s ‘nighttime’ via light input from the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus.  Summary of the Hypothalamus &amp; Epithalamus      The hypothalamus lies below the thalamus. The optic chiasm (crossing of optic nerve fibres) covers most of the basal hypothalamus.    The hypothalamus has multiple nuclei involved in autonomic control, satiety, body temperature and fluid balance. It is not necessary to know the names and function of these all of these nuclei.    Then hypothalamus sends autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) outputs through nuclei in the medulla.    The pituitary gland is connected to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk (infundibulum).    The pineal gland (epithalamus) is located immediately posterior to the thalamus and superior to the superior and inferior colliculi of the midbrain.    The pineal receives light information through a relay in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Based on the level of light, the pineal secretes melatonin at night and is involved in the control of circadian cycles and sleep.

(VERY DIRTY) Mnemonic: Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, To Touch And Feel (a) Virgin Girl’s Vagina And Hymen.            O → Olfactory (CN I).      O → Optic (CN II).      O → Oculomotor (CN III).      T → Trochlear (CN IV).      T → Trigeminal (CN V).      A → Abducens (CN VI).      F → Facial (CN VII).      V → Vestibulocochlear (CN VIII).      G → Glossopharyngeal (CN IX).      V → Vagus (CN X).      A → (Spinal) Accessory Nerve (CN XI).      H → Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII).        Of these, 4 nerves carry parasympathetic innervation:          III → Oculomotor.      VII → Facial.      IX → Glossopharyngeal.      X → Vagus.        Some of these nerves play a role in our senses:          Olfactory Nerve (CN I) → smell.      Optic Nerve (CN II) → sight.      Facial &amp; Glossopharyngeal (CN VII, IX) → taste.      Vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) → hearing &amp; balance.      Functions of the Cranial Nerve  Unlike with the spinal nerves roots, where the dorsal roots are all sensory, and the ventral roots are all motor, the cranial nerves are a hodgepodge of motor and sensory innervation.  To remember these, use the following mnemonic:          Some Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Big Brains Matter Most.      Or, if you’re of the dirtier persuasion, you could use Big Breasts.        S → Sensory (smell).  S → Sensory (vision).  M → Motor (+ parasympathetic).  M → Motor.  B → Both.  M → Motor.  B → Both (taste + parasympathetic too).  S → Sensory (hearing and balance).  B → Both (taste + parasympathetic too).  B → Both (+ parasympathetic).  M → Motor.  M → Motor.Origins of the Cranial Nerve  Generally the lower numbers exit the brain more anteriorly, and the higher numbers exit the brain more posteriorly.          The exception is the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII); it actually exits anteriorly to XI.        Origins of the Cranial Nerves:          CN I → Olfactory bulb      CN II → Optic tract      CN III &amp; IV → Midbrain      CN V → Pons      CN VI-VIII → Pons/Medulla      CN IX, X &amp; XII → Medulla      CN XI → Spinal cord        CN V comes off exclusively from the pons; VI-VIII come off and the junction between the pons and medulla.Exits of the Cranial Nerves  I → Cribriform Plate.  II → Optic Canal.  III, IV, V1, VI → Superior Orbital Fissure.          This is easy to remember; all the nerves that move the eye, plus the branch of the trigeminal that provides sensory information near there.        V2 → Foramen rotundum.  V3 → Foramen ovale.  VII, VIII → Internal Acoustic Meatus.  IX, X, XI → Jugular Foramen.          Recall that the sigmoid sinus also runs through here, to become the internal jugular vein.        XII → Hypoglossal Canal.Summary of the Cranial NervesSensory Innervation of the Dura Mater  Objective      Outline the sensory nerve supply of the dura mater.    The dura mater has sensation, largely through the CN V (trigeminal).  Recall that the trigeminal nerve has 3 branches:          Ophthalmic (V1) → to the eye region.      Maxillary (V2) → to the maxilla.      Mandibular (V3) → to the mandible.        Their innervation of the dura mater however, is more complicated.          V1 → antero-medial dura, but also sneaks to the back of the head to innervate most of the cerebellar tentorium.      V2 → over where the maxilla would be.      V3 → near where the foramen ovale is (where the mandibular leaves).      Cervical Spinal Nerves → mainly from C2, C3, innervates the dura over the posterior fossa.      Arterial Supply of the Cranial Cavity  Objective      Describe the intracranial course of the main arteries supplying the brain, name their main branches and state their areas of supply.    There are 4 arteries (2 pairs) that supply the brain itself:          Anteriorly, 2 x Internal Carotid Artery, branching off the common carotids.      Posteriorly, 2 x Vertebral Artery, branching off the subclavians.        As we saw in MSK, the vertebral arteries go through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae, and enter the foramen magnum.  In addition, there is another pair of arteries that enters the skull, but doesn’t enter the brain:          2 x middle meningeal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, which is a branch off the external carotid.      The middle meningeal tracks along the inner surface of the skull, and supplies the meninges with blood.      Note that the middle meningeal runs near the thin pterion! This will be important later on.        Recall from ENT the branches of the external carotid:          Superior Thyroid.      Ascending Pharyngeal.      Lingual.      Facial.      Occipital.      Posterior Auricular.      Maxillary.      Superficial Temporal.        Mnemonic → Some Anatomists Like Freaking Out Poor Medical Students.          Of these, the middle meningeal comes off of the maxillary artery.        Arteries of the Cranial Cavity      4 vessels supply the brain:              2 x Internal Carotid Artery, coming off the common carotids.        2 x Vertebral Artery, coming off the subclavians.              2 other vessels enters the skull, but don’t supply the brain:              2 x Middle Meningeal Artery.            Foramina for the Cranial Vessels  The foramina through which the key vessels of the skull pass through are:          Carotid Canal → Internal Carotid Arteries.      Jugular Foramen → Internal Jugular Veins      Foramen Magnum → Vertebral Arteries.      Foramen Spinosum → Middle Meningeal Arteries.        The foramen spinosum is a tiny hole that’s lateral to the foramen ovale (which was where V3 went through).  What else goes through the jugular foramen?          Recall that the sigmoid sinus enters the jugular foramen, to become the IJV.      In addition to this, we also mentioned that cranial nerves IX, X, XI also go through the jugular foramen.        Correction → the original slide said that the internal carotid goes through the foramen lacerum. This is incorrect; it actually goes through the carotid canal (as mentioned above).          Although the foramen lacerum is close to the carotid canal, nothing actually goes through it, because in living people, it’s actually covered in cartilate.        Foramina for the Cranial Vessels      Carotid Canal → Internal Carotid Arteries.    Jugular Foramen → Internal Jugular Veins    Foramen Magnum → Vertebral Arteries.    Foramen Spinosum → Middle Meningeal Arteries.  The Circle of Willis  Objective      Define the term “Circle of Willis” and state its functional significance.    Circle of Willis → a circle of blood vessels formed between the 4 major arteries that feed the brain.          Slick setup; by having anastamoses between the cerebral arteries, there is collateral circulation if any of the 4 arteries are affected.      Good at compensating for the gradual occlusion of one vessel (eg. plaque accumulation), but insufficient for compensating for sudden changes (eg. a burst aneurysm).      Location → runs around the pituitary stalk and optic chiasm (very small). Above the cavernous sinus.        Anatomy of the Circle of Willis:          Posteriorly, the L &amp; R vertebrals combine to form the basilar artery.      This then splits to form 2 x posterior cerebral arteries.      Anteriorly, the L &amp; R internal carotids give off anterior cerebral arteries.      The posterior cerebral arteries connect to the ICAs via the posterior communicating branches.      The two anterior cerebral arteries connect via a single anterior communicating branch.      After the ICAs give off the anterior cerebrals, they continue as the middle cerebral arteries.        THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIES ARE NOT PART OF THE CIRCLE OF WILLIS.          See the figure; the middle cerebral arteries are not part of the circle itself.        Objective      Outline the distribution of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries to the cerebral cortex.    You can figure out the distribution of the cerebral arteries based on how they exit the Circle of Willis:          The anterior cerebral arteries exit straight out, so they supply the midline.      The middle cerebral arteries exit to the sides, so they supply the lateral brain.      The posterior cerebral arteries reflect backwards, so they supply the posterior and inferior brain.        Note that the middle cerebral arteries are considered the terminal branches of the internal carotid arteries, and the posterior cerebral arteries are the terminal branches of the basilar artery.Cranial Hematomas  Cranial hematomas can be classified into 3 groups, depending on where the blood leakage occurs:          Epidural Hematoma.      Subdural Hematoma.      Subarachnoid Hematoma.        Because the structures in each compartment difer, the causes of each differ as well.1. Epidural Hematoma  Objective      State the origin and intracranial location of the middle meningeal artery and its significance in intracranial hemorrhage.    Epidural Hematoma → blood in the epidural space (between the dura mater and the skull).  Cause → Typically due to a fracture at the pterion, which tears the middle meningeal artery.          Recall that the pterion was the thinnest part of the skull, and that it’s nearby the path of the middle meningeal.      This causes filling of the potential space between the dura and skull.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          The classic presentation is that the person passes out, but then come-to and seem normal (lucid interval).      Gradual compression of the brain then results in coma.      Without relief of the pressure, the central structures of the brain will try and herniate through the foramen magnum.      This compresses the structures that control your breathing, which can lead to respiratory failure.      2. Subdural Hematoma  LESS COMMON THAN A SUBARACHNOID OR EPIDURAL HEMATOMA.  Subdural Hematoma → blood in the subdural space (between the arachnoid and dura mater).  Cause → Sudden acceleration-deceleration of the brain parenchyma.          Results in tearing of the reflections of the meningeal layers of the dura mater.      This can also tear the bridging veins, which transmit blood from the cerebral veins in the subarachnoid space up to the venous sinuses (which lie between the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura).      This results in venous leakage into the subdural space.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          The seepage of blood here is generally slower since it’s of venous origin.      Symptoms may appear weeks after the injury.      3. Subarachnoid Hematoma  Subarachnoid Hematoma → blood in the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater).  Cause → Typically due to a ruptured aneurysm; typically saccular/berry aneuryms (round outpouchings).          Recall that the cerebral vessels and the CSF run in the subarachnoid space.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          “Thunderclap” headache → extremely intense.      Nausea, vomiting, LOC.      Neck stiffness due to increased pressure on the meninges.      Visual changes.        Summary of Hematomas                    Type        Location        Cause        Symptoms                            Epidural        Between skull and dura mater        Fracture of pterion, resulting in tearing of the middle meningeal artery        Brief lucid interval followed by coma                    Subdural        Between dura mater and arachnoid mater        Acceleration-deceleration injury, resulting in tearing of the bridging veins        Often slow progression since venous flow is slower                    Subarachnoid        Between arachnoid mater and pia mater        Ruptured aneurysm, typically of a cerebral artery        Thunderclap headache, severe nausea, vomiting, LOC            Hydrocephalus  Hydrocephalus → ‘water in head’.          Caused by conditions where the CSF that’s produced in the brain can’t escape.      The accumulation of CSF puts pressure on the brain, which can cause serious consequences.      In patients &lt; 2 y/o with hydrocephalus, the sutures haven’t fused yet so the skull can expand to accomodate this growth.      This results in the infants that you see with massive skulls.        Hydrocephalus can be categorized as 2 types:          Non-communicating (aka. Obstructive) → the CSF can’t reach the subarachnoid space.      Communicating (aka. Non-Obstructuve) → the CSF can reach the subarachnoid space, but can’t drain into the venous sinuses via the arachnoid granulations.      Obstructive Hydrocephalus  Also known as non-communicating hydrocephalus.  Here, the CSF made in the ventricles can’t get out into the subarachnoid space.          As a result, the ventricles dilate due to continued CSF production and accumulation.      This pushes the cerebrum against the skull and flattens the gyri.      Non-Obstructive  Also known as communicating hydrocephalus.  Here, although the CSF can reach the subarachnoid space, the arachnoid granulations can’t drain the excess CSF.          This is usually a consequence of a bleed or meningitis, which scars the meninges.      This scarring blocks outflow of CSF via the arachnoid granulations.      Since the CSF can get into the subarachnoid space, but can’t get out, it ends up pushing the brain from the outside.        Intead of pushing the brain OUT from within (obstructive), here you’re pushing the brain IN from outside.          This is conceptually analogous to a subarachnoid hematoma.        Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus:          In some patients, the excess CSF distributes in the subarachnoid space so uniformly that there isn’t a marked rise in the ICP.      This is referred to as a normal pressure hydrocephalus.      In these patients, symptoms can be very non-specific: gait disorder, incontinence, dementia. In other words, it’s almost impossible to differentiate from old age!        Summary of Hydrocephalus                    Type        Cause        Result                            Obstructive (Non-Communicative)        CSF can’t get into subarachnoid space        CSF pushes the brain OUT from within                    Non-obstructive (Communicative)        CSF can get into the subrachnoid space, but can’t drain into the venous sinuses        CSF pushes the brain IN from outside            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/17/anatomy-cranial-cavity-2.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity I", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define the neurocranium and name the bones and sutures contributing to it.  Define the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae and list the main osteological features of each.  Describe the meninges, their specializations (dural folds, venous sinuses, arachnoid granulations), their relationship to one another, and their clinical significance with respect to intracranial hemorrhage.The Neurocranium  Objective      Define the neurocranium and name the bones and sutures contributing to it.    The skull is classically divided into 2 parts:          Neurocranium → the part that holds the brain.      Viscerocranium → the bones of the face.        Calvaria → roof of the neurocranium.  Cranial Base → floor of the neurocranium.Osteology of the Neurocranium  The bones of the neurocranium include:          Frontal Bone → single.      Parietal Bone → paired.      Sphenoid → single bone; located in the middle of the skull.      Temporal Bone → paired.      Occipital Bone → single.        Some features on the inferior aspect of the neurocranium are as follows:  On the temporal bone:    The reason our bones have bumps (tubercles, tuberosities, etc), are due to the attachments of structures, which act to gradually pull on the bone.          External Auditory Meatus → your ‘ear hole’, one on each temporal bone.      Mastoid Process → can be felt as a ‘bump’ behind your ear, formed due to the pulling action of the sternocleidomastoid.      Styloid Process → very pointed, and pronounced. Called ‘styloid’ because it’s shaped like a pen.        On the occipital bone:          Occipital condyles → this is what articulates with the atlas (C1), and allows you to nod.      Foramen magnum → ‘big window’, through which your brain stem and spinal cord exits the cranial cavity.      External occipital protuberance → where some muscles of the neck (eg. trapezius), and the ligamentum nuchae attach.      Sutures of the Neurocranium  Sutures → joints between the flat bones of the neurocranium.          Once they fuse, they don’t move together, but they are still considered joints.        The sutures are as follows:          Sagittal suture → easy to remember; in the sagittal plane, between the two parietal bones.      Coronal suture → separates the frontal bone from the two parietal bones.      Lambdoid suture → shaped like a λ, separates the occipital bone from the two parietal bones.      Frontal/Metopic suture → only present in infants because the frontal bone arises from two parts, which fuse later on. The suture between them is the metopic suture.        The flat bones grow into the sutures without requiring a cartilaginous template.          Recall from ITM (long time ago!) that the flat bones of the head are formed by intramembranous ossification.                  With intramembranous ossification, the bone forms directly from a mesenchymal membrane, without requiring a template.          Contrast this with the long bones in our body (arms, legs), which are formed by endochondral ossification, where a cartilaginous model gets ossified later.                      When you’re an infant, you have soft parts in your skull called fontanelles, which are large membranous openings between the bones of the skull.          These allow the bones to glide over each other during birth, and allow for the skull to fit through the vaginal opening.      Fontanelles disappear within 18 months of birth.        The sutures in infants also remain open to allow for rapid brain growth in the first couple of years.Clinical Application  Craniosynostosis → premature fusion of the cranial sutures.          This results in reduced growth in the region where the sutures fused prematurely.      The most common example is where the sagittal suture fuses prematurely, resulting in a narrow head.      In cases where the metopic suture (between the two pieces of the frontal bone) fuses too early, you can end up with a pointy forehead.        Craniosynostosis will result in abnormal brain development, unless the affected sutures are released (involving surgery).Landmarks of the Skull  These landmarks indicate where sutures of different bones meet.  Examples include:          Bregma → the intersection between the frontal and sagittal suture.      Lambda → the intersection between the lambdoid and sagittal suture.      Pterion → at the blending of the sutures between the temporal bone, parietal bone, and sphenoid bone. Forms an H shape.        Of these 3, the most clinically important landmark is the pterion, because it’s structurally where the skull is the thinnest.The Cranial Fossae  Objective      Define the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae and list the main osteological features of each.    The cranial fossae are depressions in the internal cranial base, and are formed by different parts of the brain.  The cranial fossae are as follows:          Anterior → contains the frontal lobes.      Middle → contains the temporal lobes.      Posterior → contains the cerebellum and brainstem.It was called the sella turcica (the Turkish seat) because of its resemblance to a saddle used by the Turks which had supports in the front and back.        In the centre of the middle cranial fossae is the region where the pituitary is held (recall, the sella turcica).  The height of each of these fossa is in descending order: the anterior fossa is the most shallow, and the posterior fossa is the deepest.          So if you poured water into the anterior cranial fossa, it would cascade down into the middle, and then posterior fossae.        Summary of the Cranial Fossae      There are 3 fossa that comprise the cranial base.                      Fossa        Contains                            Anterior        Frontal Lobes                    Middle        Temporal Lobes                    Posterior        Cerebellum &amp; Brainstem            Anterior Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Frontal Bone (green).      Sphenoid Bone (red).      Ethmoid Bone (yellow).        Frontal Component:          Although the frontal bone forms the front of the skull, it also reflects to form the roof of the orbit and the anterior cranial fossa.        Sphenoid Component:          The part in the anterior fossa is the lesser wing of the sphenoid, which is named relative to the greater wing, which you can see in the middle cranial fossa.      At the tips of the lesser wing of the sphenoid are the anterior clinoid processes (clinoid = bed post). These are also formed by the tugging of the dura.      In combination with the posterior clinoid processes in the middle fossa, these form a ‘4-poster bed’ that surrounds the pituitary.        Ethmoid Component:          The part of the ethmoid bone that forms the anterior cranial fossa is called the cribriform plate, which is named as such because it has many small holes that allow the olfactory nerves to get through to the nose.      Along the midline of the ethmoid is the crista galli (crest of the rooster), which sort of looks like a mohawk.                  The crista galli is formed by the tugging of the dura on the ethmoid.                    Middle Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Sphenoid Bone (red).      Temporal Bone (orange).      Parietal Bone (pink).        Note that the temporal bone has 2 parts:          Squamous → sheet-like; this is what we saw on the outside of the neurocranium.      Petrous → ‘like a rock’; this is the hardest bone in the body! The middle and inner ear are found here.        An important part of the middle cranial fossa is the sella turcica:          This is where the pituitary sits.      There are 3 parts which comprise the sella turcica:                  Hypophyseal fossa → aka. the pituitary fossa; this is the seat.          Tuberculum sellae → this is the anterior wall.          Dorsum sellae → this is posterior wall.                    Off the dorsum sellae are the posterior clinoid processes, which as we mentioned before, form a 4-poster bed along with the anterior clinoid processes.      Posterior Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Temporal Bone (orange).      Parietal Bone (pink).      Occipital Bone (purple).        Key components in the posterior fossa include:          Foramen magnum → where the spinal cord and brain stem exit the cranial cavity.      Clivus → latin for slope; refers to the little slide down into the foramen magnum where the medulla sits.      Internal occipital protuberance.      Internal occipital crest.        As with the crista galli, the internal occipital protuberance and internal occipital crest are formed by the pulling of the dura.The Meninges  Objective      Describe the meninges, their specializations (dural folds, venous sinuses, arachnoid granulations), their relationship to one another, and their clinical significance with respect to intracranial hemorrhage.    The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord, and consist of 3 layers:          Dura mater → ‘tough mother’; the tough outer layer.      Arachnoid mater → beneath the dura; named as such because of the spidery, web-like appearance of its fibres.      Pia mater → ‘tender mother’; referred to as such because it is faithful/clining; it adheres closely to the brain.      Dura Mater  Tough mother.  Comprised of an outer periosteal and inner meningeal layer.  The meningeal layer actually pulls off of the periosteal layer and folds in on itself to produce folds.  There is a potential space between the dura and the skull, and between the dura and arachnoid mater.          Epidural space → between the dura mater and skull.      Subdural space → between the dura and arachnoid mater.        Generally, there is no space in either of these; however, they can get filled as a result of injury (eg. with a epidural or subdural hematoma).  Additionally, wherever the inner meningeal layer reflects to form a fold, there is a gap formed between the outer periosteal and inner meningeal layers.          Within these gaps are venous sinuses; this will be shown later on.      Arachnoid Mater  Spider-like.  Thin, transparent membrane.  Covers the brain, but does not enter the sulci.  Separated from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space.  Unlike the epidural and subdural space, the subarachnoid space is a realized space.          The CSF and cerebral arteries and veins are located in the subarachnoid space.        In addition, there are arachnoid granulations, which are projections that pop through the dura mater and interact with the venous sinuses there.          These function to drain excess CSF, in order to maintain the intracranial pressure.      Pia Mater  Faithful, clinging.  Thin, delicate membrane.  Adherent to the surface of the brain → unlike the arachnoid mater, this goes into the sulci.Meningitis  Meningitis → inflammation of the meninges.          Typically caused by a virus, but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and even some drugs.        Symptoms: headache, fever, drowsiness.  Can lead to: inflammation and sepsis, coma, death.Signs of Meningitis  Kernig’s Sign → straight leg raises causes marked pain/discomfort in the neck.  Brudzinski’s Sign → the opposite; here, you lift up the neck, and the legs involvuntarily lift up.  Nuchal Ridigity → an inability to flex the neck due to rigid muscles.  Lumbar Puncture → take a sample of the LSF.          Taken at the level of L4 (PSIS); recall from MSK that this is done to avoid the spinal cord.        Kernig’s sign and Brudzinski’s sign are highly specific, but not very sensitive; hence they’re good for ruling-in meningitis.  Summary of the Meninges      Meninges cover and help protect the brain    3 layers of meninges:              Outermost layer is dura mater        Middle layer is arachnoid mater        Innermost layer is pia mater              Potential space between dura mater and skull isepidural space    Potential space between dura mater and arachnoidmater is subdural space    Real space between arachnoid mater and pia mater issubarachnoid space               This is where cerebral arteries and veins and CSF run              Meningitis = inflammation of meninges.  Dural Folds  As mentioned previously, the inner meningeal layer of the dura mater separates from the outer periosteal layer to form folds.  These function to separate regions of the brain, and prevent the brain from moving around too much.  The largest and most important fold is the cerebral falx; this is a fold that separates the L and R hemispheres of the brain.          Attaches to frontal crest, crista galli, internal occipital protuberance and the midline of the calvaria.        In addition, there is the cerebellar tentorium.            It’s named as such because it acts as a tent for the cerebellum.      This separates the cerebellum from the cerebrum.      Continuous with the cerebral falx.      There is a ‘tentorial notch’ anteriorly that allows the brainstem to pass through.        Other dural folds include:          Sella Diaphragm → forms a roof over the pituitary, with a small opening for the infundibulum (pituitary stalk). Like a blanket over the pituitary (to go along with the 4-poster bed).      Cerebellar falx → similarly to the cerebral falx, this partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres.        Summary of Dural Folds                    Name        Location                            Cerebral Falx        Between the L and R hemispheres of the cerebral cortex                    Cerebellar Tentorium        Forms a ‘tent’ over the cerebellum                    Sella Diaphragm        Covers the pituitary; small opening for the stalk                    Cerebellar Falx        Partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres            Venous Drainage of the Cranial Cavity  As mentioned before, these form between the outer periosteal and inner meningeal layers of the dura; hence, they’re surrounded by dura mater.          Large veins from the brain empty into sinuses which ultimately drain into the internal jugular veins (IJV).      In addition, the veins also serve to receive CSF from the arachnoid granulations (mentioned previously).        Along the cerebral falx, there are 2 important venous sinuses:          Superior sagittal sinus → along the top fold.      Inferior sagittal sinus → along the bottom fold.        The superior sagittal sinus travels all the way to the back of the head, to the confluence of the sinuses.  The inferior sagittal sinus stops at the anterior border of the cerebellar tentorium, and then connects to the confluence via the straight sinus.  From the confluence of the sinuses, the blood then goes transversely through the transverse sinuses, and then through a s-shaped sigmoid sinus.  Finally, they exit through the jugular foramen.          Aptly, once the sigmoid sinuses leaves the jugular foramen, they’re no longer called sigmoid sinuses, but  instead called internal jugular veins.        The arachnoid granulations are located primarily along the superior sagittal sinus, and also in lateral offshoots called lateral venous lacunae.  As mentioned before, this is where excess CSF leaves the cranial cavity.  Because of the pressure created by these lacunae, you can actually see depressions on the inside of the skull!   Venous Drainage of the Skull      There are 2 main sinuses along the skull; the superior sagittal sinus, and the inferior sagittal sinus.    The superior sagittal sinus drains directly into the confluence; the interior sagittal sinus drains indirectly via the straight sinus.    Once blood reaches the confluence, it travels along the side of the skull via transverse sinuses, and then into an s-shaped vessel called the sigmoid sinus.    The sigmoid sinus passes through the jugular foramen; once it passes this, it’s now known as the internal jugular vein.  The Cavernous Sinus  The cavernous sinus is probably the most clinically important sinus.          Unlike the other venous sinuses, which form tubes, this is more of a plexus.                  As a result, blood in the cavernous sinus is more sluggish, and is more prone to infection.                    In addition, the cavernous sinus is an important area of venous communication; it connects to a number of places outside the cranial cavity, such as the face, jaws, etc.      POTENTIAL ROUTE FOR INFECTION → an infection can start from outside the neurocranium, and get inside via the cavernous sinus!        Clinical Examples:            One example of how an infection can track into the brain is via the facial vein, which communicates with the ophthalmic vein, which then communicates with the cavernous sinus.      As a result, an infection in the danger triangle (shown right), can track into facial vein → ophthalmic vein → cavernous sinus → meningitis.      So if you’re really unlucky, and you have a gruesome pimple there, you could get meningitis!!      Another example is with a tooth infection, which could track to the pterygoid venous plexus → cavernous sinus → infection.      The petrosal sinuses are named as such because they relate to the petrosal portion of the temporal bone.  The cavernous sinus communicates with the rest of the sinuses of the skull via petrosal sinuses.          Superior petrosal → runs along the border of the middle and posterior cranial fossae, and enters the sigmoid sinus.      Inferior petrosal → typically drains into the internal jugular (past the jugular foramen), but sometimes drains into the sigmoid instead.        Importantly, everything leaves through the jugular foramen.  Remember      The cavernous sinus is an important route through which an infection could track into the brain.    It drains via superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, into the sigmoid sinus/IJV.  Relations of the Cavernous Sinus  The cavernous sinus lies around the sella turcica and pituitary; hence it’s near a lot of vulnerable structures.  These include:          Optic tract.  Interestingly, the internal carotid artery actually runs through the cavernous sinus (an artery runs through a vein)! This is the only place in the body where this happens.      Internal carotid artery      Abducens (CN VI) → runs with the ICA.      Oculomotor (CN III)      Trochlear (CN IV)      Ophthalmic (V1 of Trigeminal)      Maxillary (V2 of Trigeminal)        So what could happen with a cavernous sinus infection?          Problems with eye tracking (CN III, IV, VI).      Abnormal sensation in the ophthalmic and maxillary regions (V1 &amp; V2).      If the infection came from the ophthalmic vein, then eye problems may be seen too.        These symptoms are described as Cavernous Sinus Syndrome:          Presentation → think of the surrounding structures:                  Orbital or facial pain, orbital swelling and chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), fever, oculomotor neuropathy, trigeminal neuropathy.                    Causes → anything in or nearby the cavernous sinus.                  Typically from cavernous thrombosis, due to infection.          Also can be caused by carotid aneurysms (ICA runs through cavernous sinus), carotid-cavernous fistulas, meningiomas, or pituitary tumours.                      Cavernous Sinus Syndrome      Caused by anything that causes pressure near the cavernous sinus.    The symptoms that it causes can be deduced from the surrounding anatomy:              Internal Carotid Artery.        Motor Innervation to Eye → CN III, IV, VI.        Sensory Innervation to Upper Face → V1 and V2 of CN V.            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/17/anatomy-cranial-cavity-1.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cerebrum", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Know the names and locations of the major sulci, fissures and the name location and border of the lobes of the cerebral cortex.  Know the names, locations and function of the motor, sensory and association areas of the cerebral cortex.Major Regions of the Brain  Cerebrum = the largest part of the brain, and includes the cerebral cortex.  Parts of the brain include:          Cerebrum.      Diencephalon.      Midbrain.      Pons.      Medulla Oblongata.      Cerebellum &amp; Spinal Cord.        Through our neuroanatomy lectures, we’ll be working from the top down, starting from the cerebrum.The CerebrumOverview of the Cerebrum  The cerebrum is comprised of 3 parts:          Cerebral cortex (aka. gray matter) → comprised of neurons.      Cerebral white matter → comprised of axons; this serves to connect different regions of the cerebral cortex and the subcortical structures.      Deep gray matter → made up of the basal ganglia.        The cerebral cortex is split into 2 hemispheres, the L and R hemisphere.  In humans, we have a gyrencephalic brain (the cortex has folds), while in smaller mammals like rodents, they have a lissencephalic brain (the cortex is smooth).          Another important differentiator is the amount of cerebral white matter; humans have significantly more neural interconnections.        Remember      The cerebrum is comprised of (1) cerebral cortex, (2) cerebral white matter, and (3) deep gray matter.    The cerebral cortex is comprised of neurons; the cerebral white matter is comprised of axonal interconnections.  Overview of the Cerebral Hemispheres  The two cerebral hemispheres is the largest part of the brain; it comprises 83% of the total brain mass.  Different regions have different functions:          Sensory.      Motor.      Multi-modal Association Areas (perception &amp; interpretation).        The surface of the cerebral cortex has grooves and ridges.          Gyri = ridges.      Sulci = grooves.        When a sulcus is particularly deep, it’s instead referred to as a fissure.  Some of these gyri and sulci are consistent between brains, and help provide an anatomical landmark to separate different regions.Lobes of the Cerebrum  The cerebrum has 5 lobes (paired):          Frontal.      Parietal.      Temporal.      Occipital.      Insular (hidden; insulated)        The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by the central sulcus.  The frontal and temporal separated by the lateral (sylvian) fissure.  The occipital and parietal lobes are aptly separated by the parietal occipital sulcus.  The insular lobe is hidden beneath the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.          As shown to the right, if you reflect these apart, then you can see the insular lobe hiding underneath.      This is why the insular lobe is named as such; it’s ‘insulated’ by the other lobes.      Subdivisions of the Major Lobes  On either side of the central sulcus (separating the frontal and parietal lobes), are two gyri:          The precentral gyrus is the primary somatomotor cortex.      The postcentral gyrus is the primary somatosensory cortex.        Hence, the precentral gyrus lies in the frontal lobe; the postcentral gyrus lies in the parietal lobe.  Before the precentral gyrus, and after the postcentral gyrus, there are another two conserved grooves:          Precentral sulcus.      Postcentral sulcus.        This can be seen to the right; there are 3 sulci (precentral, central, and postcentral), and 2 gyri (precentral and postcentral).  This process of subdivision makes it possible to further classify components of each of the lobes (see right).          Although this may seem complicated, the naming is fairly straightforward.      For example, the frontal lobe can be split into a superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus, which are split by a superior and inferior frontal sulcus.      You don’t need to remember these subdivisions.        Brodmann Classification → this was an attempt to classify the areas of the brain based on their cellular composition; 52 distinct areas were identified.Development of the Cerebral Cortex  The cerebral cortex and lateral ventricles developed originally as a c-shaped structure.  More details are described in the IL; you have to do it; it will be tested!  Key Points on the Cerebrum      The cerebrum is composed of:              Cerebral cortex (gray matter) → neurons.        Cerebral white matter → axons.        Deep gray matter → basal ganglia.              Different anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex have different functional roles; functions include:              Sensory.        Motor.        Multi-modal association (perception, interpretation.)              Gryi = ridges, sulci = folds. Deep sulci are known as fissures.    The cerebral cortex and the lateral ventricles formed a c-shape during development.    Key Points on the Cerebral Lobes      The (paired) lobes of the cerebral cortex include:              Frontal Lobe        Parietal Lobe        Temporal Lobe        Occipital Lobe        Insular Lobe              The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by the central sulcus.    The parietal and occipital lobes are separated by the parietal occipital sulcus.    The temporal and frontal/parietal lobes are separated by the lateral (sylvian) fissure.    The insular cortex is buried beneath the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes and can be seen if these lobes are pulled out of the way.    Anterior to the central sulcus is the precentral gyrus, which is the primary motor cortex.    Posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus, which is the primary sensory cortex.    The major lobes can be subdivided based on the prominent sulci that they contain and their location on the lobe (superior, middle or inferior positions on the lobe). Brodmann mapped 47 different regions of the cortex.  Sensory Regions of the Cortex  The sensory regions of the cortex are ALL located behind the central sulcus.  In addition to the postcentral gyrus which we mentioned previously, there are other key sensory regions.  These sensory regions can either be classified as primary, or secondary.          Primary sensory areas are responsible for the reception of sensory information.      Secondary sensory areas are responsible for the processing of sensory information.        For instance, the primary visual cortex is a primary sensory area. It’s responsible for the reception of visual information, but not it’s interpretation (eg. it doesn’t mediate object recognition).  Object recognition is instead mediated by the visual association area, which is a secondary sensory area.Primary Sensory Areas of the Cortex  In addition to the primary somatosensory area (the postcentral gyrus, which we mentioned earlier), there are a few other primary sensory areas of the cortex:          Primary visual cortex → located at the very back of the occipital lobe. This is responsible for the reception of visual information, but not it’s interpretation (eg. it doesn’t mediate object recognition).      Primary auditory cortex → lies on the superior aspect of the temporal lobe, near the primary somatosensory cortex.      Gustatory Cortex → this is responsible for taste, and it lies at the very bottom of the primary somatosensory area.      Visceral Cortex (not shown) → this is where visceral information is fed to. It’s not seen on the diagram because it’s located on the insular cortex.      Secondary Sensory Areas of the Cortex  Information flows from the primary sensory areas (which receive information), to the secondary sensory areas (which make sense of the information).  Secondary sensory regions of the cortex include:          Somatosensory Association Cortex → responsible for interpreting touch, vibration, and proprioception information. Located just behind the primary somatosensory area.      Visual Association Area → responsible for interpreting visual information. Located just in front of the primary visual cortex.      Auditory Association Area → responsible for identifying auditory information, but not speech comprehension.      Wernicke’s Area → the auditory association area feeds into Wernicke’s area, where speech comprehension takes place.                  In 90% of individuals, Wernicke’s area is on the left side.          So what is the corresponding region on the right side being used for? Studies suggest that it’s also somewhat involved in speech, but also plays a big role in understanding emotional context.    Classically, the olfactory cortex is referred to as a ‘primary’ sensory area, but evidence suggests that the olfactory bulb itself has a primary function, and the olfactory cortex plays a larger role in association. See here.                    Olfactory Cortex (not shown) → this isn’t easily seen on the exterior of the cortex; it’s located on a medial bulge on the temporal lobe called the uncus.        Also shown to the right is the calcarine sulcus, which extends into the brain.  This is important because the primary visual cortex runs on either side of the calcarine sulcus.  The part that can be seen on the outside of the cortex is only a small part of the actual visual cortex.Summary of the Sensory Areas of the Cortex  Primary Sensory Regions                    Name        Location        Function                            Primary Somatosensory Area        Postcentral Gyrus        Reception of touch, vibration, proprioception info                    Primary Visual Cortex        Back of the Occipital Lobe        Reception of visual information                    Primary Auditory Cortex        Top of temporal lobe, near primary somatosensory area        Reception of auditory information                    Gustatory Cortex        Bottom of the primary somatosensory area        Reception of taste information                    Visceral Cortex        Insular lobe        Reception of visceral information              Secondary Sensory Regions                    Name        Location        Function                            Somatosensory Association Cortex        Posterior to the postcentral Gyrus        Interpretation of touch, vibration, proprioception info                    Visual Association Area        Anterior to primary visual cortex        Integration of visual information                    Auditory Association Area        Posterior to primary auditory cortex        Interpretation of auditory information, but not speech recognition                    Wernicke’s Area        Deep to auditory association area, generally on the left side (ie. right-brain-dominant people)        Speech interpretation                    Olfactory Cortex        Medial bulge on temporal lobe (uncus)        Interpretation of olfactory information            Motor Regions of the Cortex  The motor regions of the cortex are ALL located in front of the central sulcus.  Motor regions of the cortex include:          Primary Motor Cortex → contains pyramidal cells, which send impulses to spinal cells and and out to muscles in order to produce movement.      Premotor Cortex → as the name suggests, is located anterior to the primary motor cortex.                  Just like how the somatosensory association cortex integrates information from the primary somatosensory area, the premotor cortex helps plan and coordinate more complex movements.                    Broca’s Area → the ventral part of the premotor cortex, which specifically controls movements necessary to speech.                  Broca’s area is dependent on Wernicke’s area. Although Broca’s is needed for speech, Wernicke’s is necessary for you to understand what you want to say.          Hence, in order to have proper speech, you need both Broca’s and Wernicke’s area to be functional.                      Summary of the Motor Areas of the Cortex                    Name        Location        Function                            Primary Motor Cortex        Precentral Gyrus        Contains pyramidal cells which send impulses down to muscles                    Premotor Cortex        Anterior to the primary motor cortex        Helps plan and coordinate complex motor movements                    Broca’s Area        Ventral part of premotor cortex        Control of muscles involved in speech            Sensory &amp; Motor Homunculi  In both the primary somatosensory cortex (the postcentral gyrus), and the primary motor cortex (the precentral gyrus), there are anatomic regions that map to different body parts.          These maps are referred to as homunculi.      For both the sensory and motor homunculi, their orientation is upside down; that is, the region corresponding to the feet is at the top of the brain, and the region corresponding to the head is at the bottom.        The size of each region of these primary cortices relates to the sensitivity or dexterity of the corresponding body part.          On the somatosensory side, it relates to the sensitivity of that part of the body (the digits and lips are more heavily weighted; the trunk is less heavily weighted).      On the motor side, it relates to the dexterity of that part of the body (the face and hand is heavily weighted; the legs are less weighted).        Importantly, the somatosensory and somatomotor control is crossed.          That is, the left somatosensory cortex receives sensory information from the right side of the body, and vice versa.      Similarly, the left motor cortex sends instructions to the &lt;/i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; side of the body.      Multimodal Association Areas  Although the secondary sensory areas of the cortex let you interpret information from different senses, they don’t allow for the integration of this information.  Multimodal association areas resolve this by allowing for the integration of multiple modalities. These include:          PMAA → Posterior Multimodal Association Area.      AMAA → Anterior Multimodal Association Area.      Limbic Region        PMAA (Posterior Multimodal Association Area)          Also known as the general association or Gnostic cortex.      Located on the temporal + parietal lobes.      Since it’s on the posterior cortex (near all the sensory regions), it’s involved in the integration of sensations (tactile, visual, etc).      Gives you an awareness of the spatial location of the body, how to move your body through space, and to make sense of the environment.      This is also where we generate ideas on what we want to do.      Note that the PMAA receives processed information from the secondary sensory areas.        AMAA (Anterior Multimodal Association Area)          Receives information from PMAA, integrates it with past experience, evaluates options, and selects an appropriate response.      Includes your working memory.      Involved in personal and social interactions.      Executive area for task management.        Limbic Region          Responsible for memory and emotion.      Will be saved for a later lecture.      Within cerebral cortex, key region involved is the cingulate gyrus, which is c-shaped and lies right on top of this band of fibres called the corpus callosum, which connects the L &amp; R hemispheres.      Flow of Information Through the CortexFibre Connections of the Cerebrum  The fibre connections of the cerebrum form the white matter; they’re comprised of axon bundles.  Depending on the starting point and the ending point of these fibres, they are given different names.  Generally speaking, there are 3 types of fibres:          Association Fibres.      Commissural Fibres.      Projection Fibres.        Association Fibres are fibres that connect two regions that are in the same hemisphere. They can either be short or long:          Short → an association fibre that starts and ends in the same lobe.      Long → an association fibre that travels between lobes.        Commissural Fibres are fibres that travel between the two hemispheres.          The largest bundle of these is a commisural fibre pathway known as the corpus callosum.      It is the main connection between the left and right hemispheres of the brain.        Projection Fibres are fibres that connect the cerebral cortex to the subcortical structures.          These are the fibres that connect the cortex to the rest of the brain.      Afferent fibres heading to the cortex, and efferent fibres leaving the cortex merge in a large bundle of fibres called the internal capsule, which distributes to the subcortical parts of the brain.      When the internal capsule reaches the cortex, the fibres branch out to connect to different regions; this forms what’s known as the corona radiata.        Summary of White Matter      There are 3 types of fibres in the brain:              Association Fibres → between regions on the same hemisphere of the cortex.                      Short association fibres → between regions on the same lobe, on the same hemisphere.            Long association fibres → between regions on different lobes, on the same hemisphere.                          Commissural Fibres → between regions on different hemispheres.        Projection Fibres → between the cortex and the subcortical regions.            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/anatomy-cerebrum.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Neuroanatomy", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Know and understand the basic functions of the nervous system and the divisions responsible for these functions.  Know the anatomical parts of a neuron, the types of neurons and support cells and compare the types of neurons found in the nervous system.Functional Neuroanatomy  CNS (Central Nervous System) → brain &amp; spinal cord.           Functions as an integration and command centre.        PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) → nerves &amp; ganglia.          Acts as a communication link between the CNS and the end organs.        Divisions of the PNS            Sensory aka. afferent (inward) division      Motor aka. efferent (outward) division      Both the sensory and motor divisions of the PNS can be subdivided into somatic and visceral systems:                  Somatic (innervate areas which interact with the environment).          Visceral (innervate areas within your body); also called autonomic.                    The visceral (autonomic) motor system can be further divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.        Somatosensory innervation includes touch sense, vibration sense, and proprioception.Example  Below is an example of how the brain elicits visceral motor changes, namely cardiovascular change in response to mental stress.  In the population, there are 2 different populations of people, that react to stress differently:          Cardiovascular reactors to mental stress      Cardiovascular non-reactors to mental stress.        A study done here in London, exposed these two groups to stress (eg. mental math).          Some students had a significant increase in HR; others did not.        What regions of the brain mediates the differences in this response?          DLPFC (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex) and INS (insular cortex) activity was seen in non-reactors, none was seen in reactors.        Summary of Functional Neuroanatomy      The nervous system is responsible for many many simple andcomplex functions    The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinalcord and is an integration and command center.    The PNS the Peripheral is made up of nerves and ganglia and primarily a communication link.    The four major divisions of the peripheral nervous system are:              Somatosensory → afferent information from the environment.        Somatomotor → efferent commands out to skeletal muscles.        Visceral sensory → afferent information from organs and blood vessels.        Visceral motor → efferent output to the organs and blood vessels).              Visceral NS = autonomic NS.    Regions in the CNS are also responsible for these four components, while others are more involved in integrating responses  Anatomy of the Neuron  Dendrite → where impulses are received.  Axons → where impulses are sent through.  Cell Body.  Nucleus.  Myelin Sheath → insulates the neuron to increase conduction speed.Types of Neurons  Neurons are defined as unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar.  The distinction is based on the number of cellular projection from the cell body.   Unipolar neurons only have 1 projection, bipolar neurons have 2, and multipolar ones have multiple projections.          Multipolar Neuron                  99% of neurons.          Consists of many dendrites, and one long axon; hence there are multiple projections coming from the cell body.          Include motor neurons and interneurons (which mediate reflex arcs).                     Unipolar Neurons                  Sensory neurons.          Here, the cell body is connected to the peripheral processes by a single branch, so it is ‘unipolar’ (see below).          In the body, these cell bodies actually bunch together; this is what forms ganglia!                     Bipolar Neurons                  Seen with special sensory organs (such as the eyes).          Bipolar neurons are mainly located in the retina of the eye.                       Summary of Neuron Types                    Type        Characteristic        Examples                            Multipolar        Multiple projections from cell body        Motor neurons, interneurons                    Unipolar        One projection from cell body        Sensory neurons                    Bipolar        Two projections from cell body        Special sensory organs            Myelination of Neurons  Myelination allows for more rapid conduction of nerve impulses, by allowing the impulses to jump between interruptions in the sheath (Nodes of Ranvier).  This jumping is known as saltatory conduction.  Schwann cells create the myelin sheath in the PNS.  Oligodendrocytes create the myelin sheath in the CNS.  Not all nerves are myelinated ones; in cases where fast conduction isn’t required (eg. some visceral nerves), nerves aren’t myelinated.  Remember      Schwann cells create the myelin sheath in the PNS.    Oligodendrocytes create the myelin sheath in the CNS.    Neurons are fragile; they also need support cells.          These cells are known as astrocytes; they have a number of functions, including the buffering of glutamate and calcium.      The also form a neurovascular unit by communicating with the vasculature; this is the medium through which neurons are supplied.      Nomenclature of Neuronal Groupings  The naming of collections of neurons (or cell bodies) differs depending on whether you’re dealing with the CNS or PNS.          In the PNS, a collection of cell bodies is called a ganglia; in the CNS, a collection of cell bodies is called a nucleus.      In the PNS, a collection of neurons is called a nerve; in the CNS, there are many possible terms, including tract, fasciculus, column, funiculus, and lemniscus.        There is one notable exception; there is a large collection of neuronal cell bodies in the CNS called the basal ganglia, and not the basal nucleus.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/intro-neuroanatomy.html"},

Covers all material from weeks 1-6, greater emphasis on all clinical material.      MCQ and short answer, many questions will be case based.      Tips for this Course  A huge amount of information is covered in a very small time period.  Don’t skip the IL’s → they ARE on the exams (recall MSK…).  Learn your neuroanatomy well.  Prepare in advance.  Consider completing the practice quizzes and look at the additional resources.          There are 2 other sets of practice questions in the additional resources.        MSK &amp; Neuro integration problems are new this year.          Aim to integrate neuro and MSK issues and make things more integrative.        PCCIA: New topic; Social accountability.          New topic → Social Accountability.      Group Project → Development of a hospital policy on Physician Assisted Death.      Example Questions  What is pyramidal distribution weakness?          Here, leg flexor weakness &gt; leg extensor weakness.      If you have a brain/spinal cord problem (pyramidal aka Upper Motor Neurone weakness), you end up with this.                  In the arms, the flexors are stronger than the extensors, so the arms are bent.          In the legs, the extensors are stronger than the flexors, so the legs can’t bend well.                      What is the DDx for acute onset of aphasia (difficulty producing +/- understanding speech)?          Ischemic stroke.      Hemorrhagic stroke (intracranial hemorrhage).      Migraine aura.  When patients have a seizure in the part of the brain involving speech, then that part may be so exhausted that it can’t function normally.      Seizures (post ictal Todd’s deficit, will see later).      Psychogenic (intentionally/unintentionally ‘faking’ symptoms).                  Intentionally → Malingering.          Unintentionally → Conversion disorder.                    Suggested Resources  Cecil’s Essentials of Medicine → Very good resource.  Blumenfeld’s “Neuroanatomy through Clinical cases”          Chapter 2 is a good exam review.      Expensive (~ $100).      Useful Terms  Plegia → paralysis; essentially no voluntary movement.  Paresis → weakness.  Ataxia → difficulties with motor coordination.  Dominant hemisphere:          The hemisphere where language is housed (not necessarily )      Typically the left hemisphere in right handers.      With left handers, half of people will have a dominant right hemisphere, and the other half will have a dominant left (just like righties).        MCA → middle cerebral artery.          Common place for a stroke to occur.      An MCA stroke causes face and arm &gt; leg contralateral weakness, due to the arrangement of the neural homunculus.        Homunculus → a spatial mapping of the parts of the brain which control different parts of the brain.          The man in the motor cortex is ‘standing on its head’ (ie, the legs are controlled by the top of the brain, then the arms, then the face).      Motor Homunculus → areas which require finer detail have a larger neural representation (eg. face, hands); areas which require less (eg. feet) have a smaller representation.      Sensory Homunculus → different from the motor homunculus; sensitive regions like the lips and fingers are more heavily represented.        Different regions of the homunculus supplies different regions of the homunculus.                  ACA supplies the leg component.          MCA supplies the hand and face.          PCA supplies the eyes.                    ACA = Anterior Cerebral Artery.       MCA = Middle Cerebral Artery.      PCA = Posterior Cerebral Artery.      These 3 arteries come out from the Circle of Willis (which we’ll see later).      Imaging Axes  Just like what we saw with MSK:          Sagittal.      Axial (transverse).      Coronal (frontal).      General Approach to Neurological Problems  What is the problem? → History and P/E.  Where is the lesion? → localization.  What is the DDx?          Using key points on the history and the localization      What is the most likely diagnosis?      What should I not miss (treatable Dx, serious Dx)?        What investigations should be ordered?  Are treatments possible?Case Example  Case Summary      A 24 year old woman was physically fit and very healthy. One evening, she notices some tingling in both feet. Assuming she’s just over tired, she heads to bed. The next morning she stumbles after getting out of bed, and finds her legs feel very weak. She makes an appointment to see her GP the next day.    The next day, she cannot walk independently and needs to have support from her friend to walk. Her arms now feel weak and she has difficulty getting dressed.    In the GPs office, she has bilateral and relatively symmetrical weakness in her arms and legs. Her reflexes are absent. Her sensory examination is normal.    Key points:          Bilateral, symmetric weakness.      Reflexes are absent.      Sensory findings → tingling.      Sensory exam is normal.        What is the problem?          Subacute onset of progressive generalized weakness associated with areflexia and normal sensory exam, despite mild sensory symptoms.        Where is the lesion?          Not the brain nor the brain, recall that you would expect hyper-reflexia.      Hence this is a lower motor neuron problem, but probably isn’t due to a problem with the muscle, or neuromuscular junction, since there are sensory symptoms (tingling) as well.      Hence this is probably a peripheral nerve problem.        What is the DDx?          Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) until proven otherwise.        What shouldn’t you miss? (treatable, serious)          Acute spinal cord pathology (can cause shock and lead to paradoxical short term hyporeflexia).      Myasthenia gravis, inflammatory mypopathy, botulism, tick paralysis, etc.        What investigations should be ordered?          Nerve conduction study.      Lumbar puncture (LP).                  With GBS, will see albuminocytologic dissociation, which is pathognomonic.          This is an elevation in the CSF proteins, without an elevation in the WBCs (hence a ‘dissociation’).                      Are treatments possible?          IVIG → shortens the duration of symptoms, and gets them better faster.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/intro-neuroscience-eye-ear.html"},
