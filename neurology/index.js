	{"title": "Ophthalmology Focal Problems", "text": "Glaucoma  Case Summary  An asymptomatic 68-year old male was referred to Ivey Eye Institute after a routine eye examination revealed optic nerve changes. His intraocular pressure was 28mmHg in the right eye, and 15mmHg in the left eye.  Glaucoma → optic nerve damage.  Incidence can be as high as 10% in the older population.  Can be classified into 2 categories:          Open-angle →      Closed-angle →        Describe what you see in the above photos          Difference in the cup:disc ratio (R &gt; L). The cup:disc ratio on the R is greater than the left.      If they were both the same as in the R eye, and the pressures weren’t elevated, then this may just be a normal variant (they were born that way).      Normal intraocular pressure = 21; &gt; 21 is suspicious.        What is the most likely diagnosis?          Enlarged cup:disc ratio combined with an increased R intraocular pressure suggests glaucoma.      More specifically, this is suggestive of open angle glaucoma.      Look at the angle and make sure that it’s open, to verify the diagnosis.        What constitutes a ‘suspicious’ appearing optic nerve  What constitutes an elevated intraocular pressure?  What are the main risk factors for this condition?          Age; older age increases risk.      Family history of glaucoma.      Race; Africans have an increased risk.      Thin corneas.        List 3 classes of medications that reduce intraocular pressure and their mechanism of action          Prostaglandin analogues → increased outflow.      Beta blockers → decreased production.      α-2 agonists → both increased outflow and decreased production.      (Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) → decreased production.        What are the main systemic side effects of these medications?          Beta blockers → bronchospasm in asthmatics, reduced HR.      α-2 agonists → can cause apnea in children.      Strabismus  Case Summary      A 3-year-old child was noted to have an in-turning eye for the past several months. It was intermittent at first, but is now constant.    Strabismus  Corneal light reflex. Hirschberg reflex.  Often have wide inter-canthal bridge.  Children do not fix and follow until 3 months of age.  What is the medical term for an ‘in-turning eye’? An ‘out-turning’ eye?          Esotropia → in-turning eye.      Exotropia → out-turning eye.        What are relevant questions that should be asked on history?          Duration of symptoms, OPQRST.      Is the in/out-turning constant or intermittent?      Trauma → eg. forceps delivery at birth.      Prematurity.      Developmental milestones (assess neurological development).        What is the danger of preferential fixation with one eye?          Amblyopia → where the visual cortex doesn’t develop properly on the side that receives input from the affected eye (sensitive period).        What physical sign is visible in the photograph?          Esotropia → in-turning of the L eye.        What tests can a family doctor do in their office if they are concerned about strabismus?          Corneal light reflex.      Cover test (cover the good eye, and see if the bad eye can fixate).        When should a child with strabismus be referred to an ophthalmologist?          ASAP; you don’t want amblyopia to develop!        What are the treatment options for strabismus?          Occlusion (patching) → cover the good eye.      Glasses → if accomodative (LOOK UP).      Surgery → if more conservative options fail.      Chronic Visual Loss  Case Summary      A 60 year-old male complains of a progressive decline in vision in his right eye over the last 6 months.    What is responsible for this patient’s visual loss?          Cataracts → there’s whiteness over the pupil.        What are the early symptoms of this ocular condition?          Blurry vision.      Poor night driving. Starbursts or halos may be seen.        What part of the eye is affected by this condition?          The lens (it gets cloudy).        What are some risk factors for this ocular condition?          Age      Steroid use.      Diabetes.      Radiation exposure (the lens is particularly susceptible to radiation due to high cell turnover).      Trauma, inflammation.        How can this patient’s vision be improved?          Lens replacement → cataract surgery.        Name some other causes of painless progressive loss of vision          Diabetic retinopathy.      Glaucoma.      Optic nerve compression.      Retina  Describe what you see in the photo.          Hemorrhage → in the centre of the image.      Drusen → yellow flecks on the surface of the retina. Drusen are made up of lipids, a fatty protein. Drusen are often a normal clinical finding with age, and do not necessarily suggest macular degeneration.      Vessel changes → more narrow and tortuous.         What is the most likely diagnosis?          AMD -&gt; Advanced Macular Degeneration.        What testing can a family physician perform to help determine the diagnosis?          Amsler grid. Grid of squares, tell if looks distorted or not.      If not Amsler grid present, use any straight line.      Distortion because new growth of blood vessels causes distortion of placement of retinal cells.        What are the two major forms of this eye condition? Which form is more common?          Wet/Neovascular      Dry/degenerative -&gt; more common (80%)        How is this eye condition treated?          Dry, no effective treatment, aim to slow down progression (vitamins).      Wet, injection of anti VEGF Abs.                  avastin (Bevacizumab) used before          Lucentis now..?          All injected right now; b/c systemic side effects.                      What are the risk factors for this condition? 	- Age          Smoking      FHx      Poor nutrition      New vessel growth in macula, right under retina. Cornea – The Red Eye  Case Summary      A 23-year-old female presents with a 5-day history of a red, irritated, and painful eye. She complains that her vision has declined significantly in the affected eye. She is a soft contact lens wearer.    Describe what you see in the photo.          Ciliary flush; redness around cornea; suggests inflammation.      Whiteness on cornea.        What are the red flags on history that suggest a worrisome pathology?          Soft contact lens wearing.      Vision decline.      Acute progression.        What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?          Corneal ulcer        What are the risk factors for developing this pathology?          Contact lens wearer + poor lens care (water instead of solution).      Sleeping with lenses in.      Swimming with lenses (esp. in lakes).      Long-term contact lens use (recommended 8-10 h).        What pathogens are responsible for a very aggressive form of this pathology?          Pseudomonas.      Acanthomeba        How would you manage this patient?          Antibiotics, take out contact lenses if they’re wearing them still.      Ophtho referral.      Corneal culture.      Trauma  Describe what you see in the photo. What is the most likely diagnosis?          Foreign body on cornea.        What element of the history is concerning for a serious injury?          Hammering metal, piece got into eye.      XR or CT to r/o intraocular FB -&gt; WORRISOME SINCE MIGHT BE PENETRATING.        What are important components of the physical exam that any primary health care provider can perform?          Look at it!?        Would any imaging be warranted in this case? If so, what type?          XR or CT.      NOT AN MRI.        How would you manage this patient?          Remove FB with TB syringe, polish cornea with burr      Antibiotic drop coverage (x7 days)      Refer to Ophthalmology if ANY concern of IOFB, difficulty with removal, or in visual axis      Anesthetic drops are bad idea long-term; toxic with chronic use.      So topicals bad idea; long-term systemics bad idea. patching eye so won’t move over defect.      Fluoroscein stain of eye to see if healed. Stain = still healing; no stain = healed.

	{"title": "Neurophysiology of the Cerebellum &amp; Basal Ganglia", "text": "Cerebellum and basal ganglia are ‘side loops’ in the motor control hierarchy; they don’t directly affect LMNs.However, they regulate UMNs, which then affect LMNs.Funnelled back through thalamus back to motor cortex.Which is why important in movement disorders.Neurophysiology of the CerebellumCerebellum = back of head.Function: Cerebellum corrects ERRORS in movement commands, and imparts MOTOR SKILLS.Involved in motor learning.Functional anatomyCerebellum; highly folded.Broad transverse folia + deep fissures.Divided into lobules as well.Massive increase in density of neurons; contains HALF OF ALL NEURONS IN BRAIN.Functional divisions of the cerebellum.- There are 3 functional subdivisions of the cerebeullum.  Medial = spinocerebellum = vermis (midline) + intermediate cerebellum (lateral to vermis).  Lateral = cerebrocerebellum = lateral cerebellum.  Vestibulocerebellum = flocculonodular lobe.          Tucked underneath the other lobules of the brain, like the insular cortex.      Important functions in eye movements, balance, equilibrium.      Structurally similar, differ in IO.      Basic Circuit.The basic circuit is the same in the cerebellum.3 parts:  Direct path = sensory input -&gt; motor output.  Indirect side-loop:          Mossy fibre side loop.      Purkinje cell, major output of cerebellum.      For motor learning, this is the ‘student’; what has to be       Parallel fibre to purkinje cell connection IMPORTANT.      One purkinje cell receives lots of parallel fibres.                  WEAK SIGNAL, but connects from many.                      Climbing Fibre input.          To the purkinge cell.      This is the error detection signal.      Circuit used for learning what needs correcting (the teacher).      Purkinje cell only gets input from ONE CLIMBING FIBRE.      Hence, each purkinje cell gets weak input from multiple mossy fibres, and strong input only one climbing fibre.MOSSY FIBRE INPUT = WEAK BUT BROAD.CLIMBING FIBRE INPUT = STRONG BUT PRECISE      Purkinje cells INHIBIT the deep cerebellar nuceli. Only output from the cerebellum.FUNCTION OF THE 3 FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF THE CEREBELLUM:  Vestibulocerebellum = flocculonodular lobe.          Input: vestibular organs (inner ear).      Output: vestibular nuclei to eye, limb, and trunk (help maintain balance).      Function: tunes balance (stance and gait), and the vestibulo-ocular reflex.      Damage: balance problems:                  Ataxic gait (wide-based, looks drunk, poor sense of balance)          Romberg sign (imbalance worsens if eyes closed).          Nystagmus.                      Spinocerebellum          Input: Vision, audtion, seomatosensory and muscle afferents =&gt; LOTS.      Output: TO THE SPINAL CORD via the fastigial nucleus (vermis).      Function: Tunes and adjusts ongoing movements and muscle tone.      Damage:                   Ataxic gait due to poor control of muscle problems (unlike before, where ataxia due to balance issue).          ‘Drunk-driver test’ -&gt; falls when walking heel to toe.          Hypotonia -&gt; low muscle tone.                      Cerebrocerebellum          Input: From cerebral cortex, relaying a copy of the motor command sent to the spinal cord.      Output: Via the dentate nucleus to the motor and premotor cortex.      Function: add skill and coordination to movements.      Damage:                   Ataxia during skilled movement.          Dysmetria (inaccurate movement) and dysynergia (poor coordination).          Intention tremors -&gt; tremor right at end of motion.          Fails the finger to nose test.                    Cerebrocerebellar deficits present IPSILATERALLY; contrast to most problems which affect contralateral side.      EXAMPLE OF CEREBELLAR FUNCTIONVOR = vestibulo-ocular reflex, helps keep your eyes fixated on same place when your head moves.Gain of VOR = 1 if appropriately tuned.If motion of visual world on retina, then inappropriately tuned.Inappropriate tuning (retinal slip) results in a STRONG error signal from the climbing fibre, in addition to the signals from the mossy fibres that show what was done (student).Adujst strength at which parallel fibres talk to purkinje cells to modulate the response.Meniere’s Disease.Something wrong with fluid of inner ear.Affects vestibular afferents.1. At disease onset, produces a VOR imbalance, which results in nystagmus.2. Cerebellar response rebalances VOR to cause nystagmus to subside.3. As Meniere’s resolves, your VOR is now tuned to the pathological condition.4. Now you have nystagmus in the opposite direction.5. Nystagmus eventually disappears once the cerebellum restores the proper VOR gain again.(find cool eye animations!)Prism experiments.Put on googles which shift visual world.Goggles put mismatch in visual world.Body rapidly corrects within a few throws.When prisms removed, then have deviation in the opposite direction because we’re now tuned to the pathological condition.In patients with cerebellar lesions, they CANNOT ADAPT TO THE PRISM.The cerebellum acts like a repair shopIt learns to adapt to new tasks, and learn new motor skillsMotor disorders produced by lesions outside the cerebellum are quickly masked by this repair shopCerebellar lesions produce more long‐lasting disorders because the repair shop is itself damagedNeurophysiology of the Basal GangliaThe basal ganglia releaseappropriate movements andsuppress inappropriatemovements from premotor andmotor areasDamage to the basal ganglia is inpart responsible for Tourette’ssyndrome, which causes therelease of inappropriateutterances.TIC LIKE BEHAVIOURS.Focus on motor control here, but also plays a role in many other things, including emotion.Basal ganglia = caudate nucleus + putamen + globus pallidus + amygdala.Striatum = caudate + putamen.Substantia nigra pars reticulata projects to the superior colliculus for control of eye movements.Substantia nigra pars compacta = critical in parkinsons.Subthalamic nucleus = balancing output of basal ganglia.Striatum receives dopaminergic innervation from SUBSTANTIA NIGRA (PARS COMPACTAA).At rest, tonic inhibition from basal ganglia.WHen you want to move, inhibition of inhibitory stimulation from basal ganglia -&gt; permissive.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/24/neurophysiology-cerebellum-basal-ganglia.html"},

	{"title": "Ascending Sensory Pathways", "text": "Lecture Objectives  This lecture should integrate the material we’ve seen in previous lectures.  Name and describe the pathways for transmission of sensory information from the periphery to the termination in the spinal cord and brain.  Describe the sensory deficits due to lesions in the spinal cord, brain stem, diencephalon and cerebrum.Three main Ascending Pathways1. Dorsal Column, aka. the Medial Lemniscus Sensory System.2. Spinothalamic and Spinoreticular Pathways.3. Spinocerebellar Pathways.FOCUSING MAINLY ON INNERVATION OF BODY; sensory to head involves cranial nerves, not spinal cord.Dorsal Column PathwayDorsal Column= discriminative touch (aka. fine touch), conscious- Pressure sense- Vibration sense- Proprioception.Enters dorsal funiculus, without synapsing, enters spinal cord.Where does it first synapse is IMPORTANT differentiating feature.Medial meniscal system does not synapse, just turns and ascends spinal cord.Organization of nerves remains intact all the way to the cortex; this is why there’s a sensory homunculus in your primary somatosensory cortex.Lower body information remains more medial in gracile fasciculus,upper body remains more lateral, in cuneate fasciculus. *SOMATOTOPY.Sensory information from Head and Neck goes into Ventral Posterior Medial.Sensory information from the rest of body goes into Ventral Posterior Lateral.What happens in brainstem?Cuneate and gracile fasciculi terminate in gracile and cuneate nuclei in medulla.Large sensory nuclei and in medulla, project as gracile and cuneate tubercles.Doesn’t cross at spinal cord, crosses after synapsing in gracile and cuneate nuclei, at the decussation of the medial lemniscus.Why called this? Because fibre pathway in medulla, pons and midbrain = medial lemniscus.L side medial meniscus damage = R side loss of sensation.L side spinal cord damage = L side loss of sensation.second order sensory neuron continues, terminates in thalamus, in ventral posterior lateral nucleus of thalamus.third order sensory neuron continues to innervate the postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex).  Sensory nerve to cuneate/gracile nuclei          Gracile = medial = lower body.      Cuneate = lateral = upper body.        Cuneate gracile nuclei -&gt; VPL  VPL -&gt; Postcentral gyrus.          Crossing occurs as the decussation of the medial lemniscus.      Neuroplasticity in somatosensoryBlind vs sighted, righties. Braille readers.Extended use of somatosensory cortex in those blind people who rely on touch to read braille. Discriminative touch, pressure, vibratory sensation, and conscious joint position enterthe dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. The axons destined to carry information to the cerebral cortex do not synapse in thespinal cord, but turn and ascend ipsilaterally through the spinal cord in the dorsalfuniculus. However, these sensory axons can also have collaterals that can synapse in thespinal cord, especially in the dorsal and ventral horns. These collaterals canparticipate spinal reflexes. The gracile fasciculus contains axons with information from the lower half. Thecuneate fasciculus contains the axons from the upper half of the body. Thus, thereis a map of the body in the dorsal funiculus such that the lower to upper body isrepresented from medial to lateral. The first order neurons of the dorsal column pathway terminate in the gracile andcuneate nuclei in the medulla. The second order neurons decussate (internal arcuate fibres) in lower medulla andascend to thalamus (VPL). The fiber bundle in the brain stem containing thesesecond order sensory axons is known as the medial lemniscus. Third order neurons from thalamus enter the cortex via the internal capsule toterminate in primary somatosensory cortex on the postcentral gyrus. A topographic map of the body is maintained at all levels of the neuraxis, from thespinal cord to the cerebral cortex.Spinothalamic and Spinoreticular PathwaysPain + temperatureDifference is that, as soon as it gets into spinal cord, it synapsesAT DORSAL HORNRecall ventral horn = motor, dorsal horn = sensory.Decussation then occurs at same level of spinal cord. GOes across white matter at midline called anterior white commisure. Right below grey matter in middle.Pain + temperature then ascents in the lateral and ventral spinothalamic/spinoreticular tract.???The spinothalamic tract consists of two adjacent pathways: anterior and lateral. The anterior spinothalamic tract carries information about crude touch. The lateral spinothalamic tract conveys pain and temperature.???COROLLARY- Say you injured your spinal cord on the L side, below the gracile and cuneate nuclei in the medulla.- Then you’d have affected ipsilateral dorsal column sensation (proprioception, vibration sense, fine touch)- You’d also have affected contralateral spinothalamic column sensation (pain + temperature)BELOW THAT LEVEL ONLY.Some of these second order neurons information will terminate in reticular formation of brainstem already know that periaqueductal gray is responsible for modulating pain, so it’s obviously involved!?!?!THALAMUSSome terminate in VPL.Some terminate in Pulvinar or intralaminar nuclei. (association nuclei)Third order neurons distribute to primary and secondary/association sensory cortices (not just primary)Also cingulate &amp; insular cortex, why? Pain is PAINFUL, unpleasant. So gets integrated in different region of cortex. Cingulate &amp; insular, part of limbic (emotional) system. Discriminate as pleasant/unpleasant.. The neurons of the reticular formation all play a crucial role in maintaining behavioral arousal and consciousness. Afferents in the spinothalamic and spinoreticular pathways convey pain (nociception)and temperature to the brain stem and the cerebral cortex. First order pain &amp; temperature afferents terminate in the dorsal horn at the samelevel that they enter. Second order neurons cross the midline in the anterior white commissure of thespinal cord and ascend to the brain in the lateral and ventral (anterior)spinothalamic and spinoreticular pathways. Some second order neurons terminate in the reticular formation in the brain stemand the periaqueductal gray for autonomic responses and reflex suppression ofpain. The second order neurons terminate in the thalamus in the VPL as well asassociation nuclei of the thalamus. Third order neurons from the VPL ascend to the cerebral cortex and terminate inprimary and secondary somatosensory cortex to convey conscious awareness ofpain. Third order neurons from the association nuclei of the thalamus also terminate inthe cingulate and insular cortices to convey the affective (unpleasant) component ofpain. Empathy, wives feeling husband pain.Never reversed it, put men in there, don’t know what they’d find… no response :PSpinocerebellar PathwaysROLE: Subconscious proprioception. Limb position sense, that never reaches level of consciousness.Important in cerebellar smoothing and coordinating of movement.This isn’t CONSCIOUS PROPRIOCEPTION (yup, my thumb it sticking up), but it’s the unconscious knowledge of where your body is in space that mediates our movements.Spinal cord, terminates at DEEPER LEVEL of dorsal horn than spinothalamic, then there are 2 possibilities:1. 1 portion immediately turns and ascends through dorsal/posterior spinocerebellar tract.Corticopontocerebellar tract, left cerebrum, terminated in pons, crossed the midline into cerebellum. Already tells us that cerebellum not ordered like cerebellum. R CEREBELLUM = RIGHT BODY. L CEREBELLUM = LEFT. IPSILATERAL vs CONTRALATERAL.Results in difference in ascending pathways.Hence, you want ascending info here to rise in ipsilateral side, WITHOUT crossing over.Dorsal (posterior) spinocerebellar tract = NORMAL, stays on ipsilateral.Second branch = VENTRAL SPINOCEREBELLAR TRACT (GREEN), actually crosses over, and then ascends.So this information is on the CONTRALATERAL SIDE, which is the opposite of the cerebellar organization.Dorsal column enters at inferior cerebellar peduncle (#3 feature, info about self), proprioceptive information goes directly in.On ventral spinal cerebellar tract, instead goes through SUPERIOR cerebellar peduncle, and then crosses the midline, and terminates on ipsilateral side. DOUBLE CROSSING.WHYYYY!?!?!Correlations; some spinocerebellar routes are on ipsilateral side in spinal cord, others are on contralateral side.MIDDLE CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE takes crossed info from PMC into contralateral side. (what was the order?)INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE takes info about proprioception in from ipsilateral branches of spinocerebellar pathways (where are you right now?)SUPERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE takes info about priorioception in from contralateral branches of spinocerebellar pathways.	- aka ventral spinocerebellar tract fibres.	- Otherwise, mostly efferent fibres?!Feedback from thalamus?Summary (spinocerebellar pathways) Afferents in the spinocerebellar pathways convey subconsciousproprioception from the trunk and lower limbs to the cerebellum. First order neurons enter the spinal cord and synapse in the intermediatezone of the spinal cord. Many second order neurons (above L3) ascend ipsipalerally in the dorsal(posterior) spinocerebellar tract and enter the cerebellum via the inferiorcerebellar peduncle. Other second order neurons cross the midline in the spinal cord and ascendthe spinal cord in the ventral (anterior) spinocerebellar tract. These axonsenter the cerebellum via the superior spinocerebellar tract and thendecussate a second time to end up on the ipsilateral cerebellum. This proprioceptive information from both tracts the spinal cord terminates inthe vermis and intermediate hemisphere of the ipsilateral cerebellum. A similar pathway exists for proprioceptive information from the upper limbswith the first order neurons terminating in the ipsilateral spinal cord andmedulla (the rostral spinocerebellar tract).Afferents summary.Afferent neuronal signals from skin and deeper structures are segregated inthe spinal cord; eg. spinothalamic tract vs. dorsal column pathway. First order axons of discriminative touch and conscious proprioceptionascend ipsilaterally to medulla; after synapsing in the medulla the axonscross midline. Second order axons of pain and temperature cross midline in the spinalcord. The second order neurons to the cerebellum ascend ipsilaterally or crossthe midline in the spinal cord and then cross again in the cerebellum.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Orbit", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Name the bones that form the walls of the orbit and state susceptibility to fracture  Describe the basic components of the eye, state its position in the orbit and name the structures involved in maintaining its position  Name the extraocular muscles and state their innervation and individual functions  Rationalize the eye movements patients are asked to perform in order to test the function of individual muscles.  Name the motor and sensory nerves of the orbit and describe their function  State the general distribution of the ophthalmic artery and the clinical significance of occlusion of its main branch to the retina  Outline the general distribution of the veins of the orbit, stating the clinical significance of anastomoses of ophthalmic veins with the cavernous sinus and extracranial veinsIntroduction to the Orbit  Orbit → the cavity or socket of the skull in which the eye and its appendages are situated. “Orbit” can refer to the bony socket, or it can also be used to imply the contents.  The eye is largely held in the bony orbit by a large amount of fat.  Muscles also help keep the eye in place (the extra-ocular eye muscles).Bones of the Orbit  Objective      Name the bones that form the walls of the orbit and state susceptibility to fracture.    Frontal Bone → roof.  Maxilla → floor.          The maxillary sinus lies right below the orbit; hence the floor of the orbit is quite thin.      Hence, the floor of the orbit is highly susceptible to fracture.        Ethmoid  Recall that this was in the anterior cranial cavity, and included the cribriform plate and the crista galli.          Forms part of the medial wall of the orbit, and is also highly susceptible to fracture. This part is called the lamina papyracea (paper thin), aka the orbital lamina of the ethmoid.        Sphenoid          Both the lesser and greater wing of the sphenoid are represented on the lateral wall, with a slit between them called the superior orbital fissure.      Recall from Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity 2 that the CN III, IV, V1, and VI travel through here. That is, the 3 motor nerves to the eye + the sensory innervation to the ophthalmic region.      We also see a hole in the lesser wing of the sphenoid, the optic canal; this is where the optic nerve goes through.        Zygomatic Bone → Forms the lateral-most margin of the orbit.  Lacrimal          A tiny bone on the medial side of the orbit with a hole that drains into the nose (the nasolacrimal duct).      Drains into the inferior meatus along the lateral nasal wall.      This is why your nose gets stuffy when you cry!        Bones of the Orbit      Roof → frontal bone.    Floor → maxillary bone.    Medial wall → ethmoid (lamina papyracea), lacrimal.    Lateral wall → zygomatic bone, sphenoid (greater + lesser wing).    Weak Points in the Orbit:              Maxilla → thin due to the presence of the maxillary sinus immediately below.        Lamina Papyracea → thin bone, part of ethmoid, on medial side of orbit.            Blowout Fractures  Direct trauma to the orbital bones is rare; more often, fractures occur due to indirect trauma to the head.  Indirect blows that displace the orbital walls will often result in a fracture of the weak parts of the orbit.  This can result in:          Medial wall blowout fracture (fracture at the lamina papyracea).      Inferior wall blowout fracture (fracture of the maxilla above the maxillary sinus).        With an inferior wall blowout fracture, you can often see the fat surrounding the orbit herniate into the maxillary sinus.          This is known as a teardrop sign (can see this on the CT on the right).      The Lacrimal Apparatus  Lacrimal fluid (tears) is formed by the lacrimal gland.          This is an almond shaped gland located in the lateral part of the orbit, just beneath the frontal bone, and just above the eyeball.        By blinking, we spread this lacrimal fluid across the cornea, laterally to medially.  On the medial side, this fluid drains into the nasal cavities via the nasolacrimal duct.          This fluid enters the duct via superior and inferior puncta, which carry fluid into the superior and inferior canaliculi, and then into the lacrimal sac.      Muscles of the Orbit  7 extraocular muscles:          1 eyelid muscle → levator palpebrae superioris.      4 recti muscles → superior, inferior, medial, lateral.      2 oblique muscles → superior, inferior.        These function to move the eye within the orbit, or elevate the eyelid (levator palpebrae superioris).  Movements of the eye include:          Elevation      Depression      ADduction.      ABduction      Internal Rotation.      External Rotation.        Positions of the Extraocular Muscles:            The superior, inferior, medial, and lateral recti attach where you’d expect them to attach; onto the superior, inferior, medial, and lateral eye.      The superior oblique and the inferior oblique, as their names suggest, attach to the eye obliquely.      Note that the superior oblique wraps around a ‘sling’ called the trochlea, which reverses the direction of its muscles fibres.      As a result, when it pulls, it moves in the opposite direction as what you’d expect given it’s origin and attachment.      In other words, although it attaches to a similar location as the superior rectus, it actually antagonizes the superior rectus.      Something similar happens with the inferior oblique, which wraps around the eye, and antagonizes the action of the inferior rectus.        Actions of the Extraocular Muscles:            You’d think that this is straightforward; since the superior rectus attaches to the top of the eye, it should elevate it!      But it’s actually a (little bit) more complicated, because the axis of the orbit and the axis of the eye are not the same. There is actually a 23° degree difference between the two.        Since the extraocular muscles originate at the orbit, and attach to the eye, they don’t pull along the axis of the eye.                   The end result of this is that the superior and inferior rectus also function to adduct the eye, and the superior and inferior oblique also function to abduct the eye.                    Hence, their true functions are as follows:                  Superior Rectus → elevate and adduct eye.          Inferior Rectus → depress and adduct eye.          Lateral Rectus → abduction of the eye.          Medial Rectus → adduction of the eye.          Superior Oblique → depress and abduct eye (ANTAGONIZES SUPERIOR RECTUS)          Inferior Oblique → elevate and abduct eye (ANTAGONIZES INFERIOR RECTUS)                    What about the Levator Palpebrae Superioris?                    The levator palpebrae superioris attaches to the tarsal plate (cartilage of the eyelid) and does exactly what its name suggests; it raises the eyelid.          Interestingly, there is a conjoint tendon between the superior rectus and the levator palpebrae.          Hence, when you look up, you also have activation of the levator palpebrae superioris in addition to the superior rectus.          This prevents you from seeing the back of your eyelid!                      Motor innervation of the Extraocular Muscles:          Everything is innervated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III), with TWO EXCEPTIONS:                  Superior Oblique, which is innervated by CN IV (Trochlear).          Lateral Rectus, which is innervated by CN VI (Abducens).                    These are easy to remember, the superior oblique goes through the trochlea, hence ‘trochlear nerve’, and the lateral rectus abducts the eye, hence ‘abducens nerve’.      The rest of the muscles (superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris) are all done by CN III.      Testing the Extraocular Muscles  Testing the extraocular muscles is more difficult than just moving the eye in the direction of each of the muscle actions.          This is because there is redundant action between extraocular muscles, so this would not isolate the muscle of interest.      For example, if you tried to test the superior oblique by asking a patient to depress and abduct their eye, you won’t be sure if their ability to depress the eye is due to the inferior rectus or the superior oblique.        To resolve this, you have to eliminate the action of the redundant muscle:          Using the same example as above, suppose we’re assessing the action of the superior oblique:                  The superior oblique does depression + abduction.          The inferior rectus does depression + adduction.                    To eliminate the downward pull of the IR, you can adduct the eye:                  This brings the axis of the eye in line with the axis of the pulling force of the SO, so it will override the downward pull of the IR.          Now, when you depress the eye, you can be sure that this depression is primarily due to the action of the SO.                        This is reflected in the figure to the right; when you’re testing the muscles that attach above or below the eye, you actually move the eye in a direction that differs from their action.          You can remember the directions for testing by imagining that you’re flipping the actions in a mirror; everything is still the same vertically, but things are transposed horizontally.

Inferior oblique has the opposite function as the inferior rectus.  Nerves of the Orbit  Sight → Optic Nerve (CN II)  Motor to Extraocular Muscles:          Trochlear Nerve (CN IV) → superior oblique.      Abducens Nerve (CN VI) → lateral rectus.      Oculomotor Nerve (CN III) → everything else.        Sensory to Orbit → Ophthalmic nerve = V1 branch of the trigeminal.            Recall that the 3 branches of the trigeminal were the ophthalmic, maxillary, and submandibular branches.      V1 (the ophthalmic branch) then gives off 3 main sub-branches:                  Frontal          Lacrimal          Nasociliary                    Cranial Nerve Palsies to the Eye  Oculomotor Nerve Palsy           Results in unopposed action of the trochlear nerve (superior oblique; down + out) and the abducens nerve (out).      Hence, patients with an oculomotor nerve palsy will present with a depressed, abducted eye on the affected side.      Will also have ptosis on the affected side without the action of the levator palpebrae superioris.        Trochlear Nerve Palsy           Commonly injured by trauma.      The trochlear nerve innervates the SO, responsible for depression + abduction.      Hence, a palsy would result in a baseline elevation + adduction of eye (an ‘up and in’ position).      Abduction would still be possible via the lateral rectus (abducens).        Abducens Nerve Palsy           Affects the lateral rectus, the main abductor of the eye.      Results in an inability to abduct, resulting in a characteristic head turn to avoid double vision.      Often seen injured with bad falls (causing increased intracranial pressure).      Arteries of the Orbit  The main artery to the orbit is the ophthalmic artery, off the internal carotid artery.          This branches off near where it emerges from the cavernous sinus, near the pituitary gland.      This runs in the optic canal with the optic nerve.        The opthalmic artery gives off a bunch of branches, which generally run with branches of the ophthalmic nerve.          These aren’t too important, except for one branch, the central retinal artery.      The central retinal artery is a tiny artery that goes into the dural sheath of the optic nerve, and intermingles with the fibres of the nerve.      It’s important because it’s the ONLY BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE EYE.      Hence, if something goes wrong with this artery, you go blind!      This is unlike most other key organs, where there is collateral circulation. With the eye, you only have one feeding vessel!        Remember      The central retinal artery is the ONLY blood supply to the eye!    Occlusion will thus lead to BLINDNESS.  Veins of the Orbit  With the venous drainage of the orbit, note that we have 2 ophthalmic veins (superior and inferior), as opposed to only 1 ophthalmic artery.          The superior ophthalmic vein runs through the superior orbital fissure, the inferior ophthalmic vein runs through the inferior orbital fissure.        Recall from Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity I, that the facial vein connects to the ophthalmic veins, and could become a route for infection.          Recall the DANGER TRIANGLE, where an infection can spread from the facial vein → ophthalmic veins → cavernous sinus → meningitis.        Review of the Cavernous Sinus            Recall that the ICA runs through the cavernous sinus (only part of the body where an artery runs through a vein).      The abducens runs right beside the ICA, while III, IV, V1 and V2 lie on the lateral walls.      An infection that tracks into the cavernous sinus can affect all of these nerves, although the abducens is usually affected first (since it lies inside the sinus).      Worsening infections can then involve III and IV, and can even affect the optic nerve (which lies above the sinus).      Hence, knowing the anatomy of the cavernous sinus is hugely clinically important.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/19/anatomy-orbit.html"},

It can then compare this with where the body is inspace, including limb position (spinocerebellum) as well as equilibriumand balance (vestibulocerebellum). Information is then sent back to thecerebral cortex to provide a correction to the command on a continuousbasis. The Spinal CordGross anatomy of the spinal cordSpinal cord = where spinal nerves enter and exit.Cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral.Leave between vertabra (intervertebral foramina).Ends at L2 ish, filum terminaleREVIEW.Cauda equina.See MSK lectures.Filum terminale, attaches end of spinal cord to coccyx so it doesn’t float arround.The spinal cord lies within the vertebral canal. However, it only extends asfar lumbar vertebra L1 or L2. The tapered end of the spinal cord is knownas the conus medullaris. The filiium terminale is a long filament of connective tissue that anchorsthe spinal cord to the coccyx. There are 31 spinal nerves, including 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5sacral and 1 coccygeal nerve. These spinal nerves leave the spinal canalthrough the corresponding intervertebral foramina. Since the spinal cord isnot as long as the vertebral column, the spinal nerves descending below theconus medullaris are known as the cauda equina. Cerebrospinal fluid canbe sampled in the region of the cauda equina below the conus medullaris. The cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord are related tothe innervation of the limbs.Cervical and lumbar enlargement = where nerves going out to limbs originate (more output to limbs than trunk).Gray matter is H shaped structure in middleEverything on outside is FIBRES; white matter, both ascending and descending.Connect spinal cord to other parts of spinal cord, and to brain.Sensory enter spinal nerves via DORSAL ROOTS; sensory only.Before it enters, splits into multiple dorsal root filaments.

(bumps on side of H)The intermediolateral nucleus (IML) = LATERAL HORN is a region of grey matter found in one of the three grey columns of the spinal cord, the lateral grey column. This is Rexed lamina VII.Location for cell bodies of sympathetic outflow. ONLY HERE SINCE SYMPATHETIC CHAIN ONLY RUNS FROM T1 to L2.Visceral motor, act like motor neurons, join ventral roots, go out to innervate organs and blood vessels of skin and muscles.Sympathetic outflow does not go directly to organ; synapses (preganglionic neuron and postganglionic neuron).Leaves spinal cord in ventral root, goes through rami communicantes into sympathetic ganglia.Synapses there, then goes back and REJOINS DORSAL AND VENTRAL RAMI, then provides sympathetic output to skin + muscle.Skeletal muscle; only the axon that leaves the spinal cord that innervates skeletal muscle, cell body remains within CNS.HENCE THERE’S NO VENTRAL ROOT GANGLION.Why isn’t there a ventral root ganglion? The dorsal root ganglion is not for protection. It is the site where the cell bodies of afferent (sensory) neurons are found. The cell bodies of efferent (motor) neurons, the axons of which form the ventral root, are located within the spinal cord, thus no enlargement. (Ganglion derives from the term for knot.)Spinal cord transection?Above sympathetic outflow, big issues with things like urination, defecation, etc.The spinal cord is the entry point for sensory information in spinal nerves. Thesensory information enters by the dorsal root. The dorsal roots separate into dorsalroot filaments before entering the spinal cord. The cell bodies of the sensory neurons are contained in the dorsal root ganglion inthe peripheral nervous system. The spinal cord contains somatic motor neurons whose axons extend to skeletalmuscle via spinal nerves. It also has contains visceral (sympathetic andparasympathetic) motor neurons with axons in the spinal nerves. The somatic and visceral motor neurons exit the spinal cord via the ventral roots. Themotor neuron axons exit the spinal cord as ventral neuron filaments before formingthe ventral root. The dorsal and ventral roots join immediately distal to the dorsal root ganglion. At thispoint the spinal nerve is a mixed nerve containing both sensory and motor fibres. Each mixed spinal nerve divides into a dorsal and ventral ramus. The dorsal ramiinnervates the skin and muscles of the back. The ventral rami innervate the skin andmuscles of the ventral trunk and limbs. Sympathetic motor neurons seen in spinal segments T1-L2, project to sympatheticganglion via rami communicantes and rejoin the spinal nerve via a separate ramicommunicantes.Dorsal funiculusVentral funiculusDorsal horn for dorsal roots.Ventral horn for motor neurons leave through ventral roots.Intermediate zone = interneurons doing connections between destinations in spinal cord.Lateral horn = ONLY BY SYMPATHETIC CHAIN. Preganglionic, have to synapse in ganglia (eg. synapse in sympathetic chain).Sections associated with the limbs have greater amountof gray matter (cervical and lumbar enlargements) White matter decreases from rostral to caudal: fewerdescending and ascending fiber fibers Gray matter of T1 to L2 has a lateral horn: the lateralhorn or the intermedial lateral cell column, the origin ofsympathetic preganglionic neurons= MAKES SENSE, less stuff going up or down! C1 necessary contains all fibres going from brain to C1 down to bottom, or back up. Sensory information at sacral joins lumbar, etc.C5 and L3 have larger size; eg. example of location where innervation to limbs take place.Note their really big ventral horns for controlling arms and hands.Anatomists (they have no life!) have looked within the spinal cord, and divided them anatomically similar to the cortex (broddman’s areas).10 laminae of rexed; different nuclei.Not important; just know that motor out through ventral horn, sensory in from dorsal horn, etc.The cuneate and gracile fasciculi together are known as the dorsal or posteriorfuniculus. The fibre tracts at the base of the spinal cord are the ventral or anterior funiculus. Sensory input terminates in the dorsal horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord. Somatic motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of the gray matter. Interneurons are located in the intermediate zone of the gray matter. The central canal contains the CSF made in the ventricles of the brain and iscontinuous with the IV ventricle. The white matter contains multiple ascending and descending sensory and motorpathways to the brain, both crossed and uncrossed.Spinal canal continuous with 4th ventricle. There is decreasing white matter caudally in the spinal cord. Some of the descendingpathways are terminating at higher levels and there are more ascending pathwaysjoining the white matter fibre tracts. There are some specialized nuclei in the spinal cord.

	{"title": "Brainstem &amp; Cranial Nerves", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Identify the 3 major subdivisions of the brainstem and describe the anatomic relationships of the major motor and sensory nuclei and the major descending and ascending tracts in the brainstem.  Know the twelve cranial nerves, where they exit the brain and their normal function.  Be able to determine the major symptoms and signs of dysfunction resulting from lesions in the brain stem.Subdivisions of the Brainstem  Objective      Identify the 3 major subdivisions of the brainstem and describe the anatomic relationships of the major motor and sensory nuclei and the major descending and ascending tracts in the brainstem.    The brainstem, as the name suggests, sits at the base of the brain and connects it to the spinal cord.          The cranial nerves largely come out at the level of the brainstem.        Subdivisions of the brainstem:          Midbrain.      Pons.      Medulla (Oblongata).        The midbrain is located inferior to the thalamus, and posterior to the pituitary.          Running through the midbrain is the cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius), which connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle.      The third ventricle is the space between the two lobes of the thalamus.      The fourth ventricle is the space between the pons/medulla and the cerebellum, and is continuous with the spinal canal.        The pons is a bulbous projection off the ventral surface of the brainstem.  The medulla lies below the pons, and is continuous with the spinal cord.Anatomical Features of the BrainstemVentral Surface of the Brainstem  Olfaction and vision don’t go through the brainstem, however they are shown in the figure below to be running above it:          Olfactory tract → the afferent tract for olfactory information to reach the uncus (in the temporal lobe).                  Note that olfactory information isn’t relayed through the thalamus, recall from Basal Ganglia &amp; Diencephalon that olfaction was the ONLY sensory modality that didn’t.                    Optic tract → the afferent tract for visual information to reach the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.                  Recall that the optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, and when they branch off again, they’re referred to as the optic tract.                      Ventral Features at the Midbrain:          Cerebral peduncles → continuation of the internal capsule (these were the projection fibres to and from the deep gray matter). These carry information between the brain and the lower brainstem and spinal cord.      Partially covering the dorsal midbrain are mamillary bodies that project off the hypothalamus; these are part of the limbic system.        Ventral Features at the Pons:          There are lots of medial → lateral fibres wrapping around the pons, which reflects how information that reaches the pons reflects around to feed to the cerebellum.      Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → this is the connection between the pons &amp; cerebellum, carrying the information that came down from the cerebral peduncles from the primary motor cortex.                  This peduncle is the one that tells the cerebellum “what action is being done”, which helps the cerebellum coordinate your movements.                      Ventral Features at the Medulla:          The medulla is continuous with the spinal cord, so its main role is to communicate motor information from the brain down into the spinal cord.      On the ventral surface of the medulla, you can see the medullary pyramids, which contain the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts:                  Corticobulbar tract → carries motor information of the cranial nerves.          Corticospinal tract → carries motor information down the spinal cord to the rest of the body.          There are 2 medullary pyramids (L &amp; R), which are separated by a ventral median sulcus.                    At this level, the information in the corticospinal tract (which will go down the spinal cord) is uncrossed, even though the L hemisphere controls the R body.                  To ‘fix’ this, the information crosses at a midline feature called the pyramidal decussation.                    Finally, lateral to the pyramids are the olivary nuclei, which give into the cerebellum.      Dorsal Surface of the Brainstem  Dorsal Features above the Brainstem:          Parts of the thalamus, including:                  Lateral geniculate (visual relay).          Medial genicular (auditory relay).          Pulvinar nucleus of thalamus.                    Epithalamus (pineal gland).        Dorsal Features at the Midbrain:  Recall in Neurophysiology of the Visual Cortex that the superior colliculus was one of 2 destinations for optic tract axons other than the LGN. The other was the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which controls the pupillary light reflex.          Superior colliculus (x2) → receives direct visual information, and guides orientation &amp; reflex tracking of moving objects.      Inferior colliculus (x2) → receives direct auditory reflexes, and controlls auditory reflexes (eg. startle in response to a sudden sound).      Tracts, responsible for connecting cerebellum to rest of brain. Midline, sitting out there, almost w/o any connection.3 large fibre tracts responsible for connecting cerebellum to rest of brain:1. Superior cerebellar peduncle to midbrain &amp; diencephalon.2. Middle cerebellar peduncle (pons), much larger, connects cerebellum with pontine nuclei, recall that this was motor information to cerebellum. 1 synapse from motor cortex.3.

The reticular formation does not form discretenuclei. Based on the location in the brain stem, the reticular formation canparticipate in several functions, including control of movement, modulationof pain, autonomic reflexes and arousal. There is also a large amount of white matter in the brain stem consisting ofpathways for brain stem connections as well as pathways for axonsconnecting the forebrain (cerebrum and diencephalon) with the spinal cord.The inferior and superior colliculi (auditory and visual reflexes) are seen aslarge nuclei in the dorsal region of the midbrain. The periaqueductal gray is a large collection of neurons surrounding thecerebral aqueduct (connects the III and IV ventricles).

	{"title": "Neurophysiology of the Visual Cortex", "text": "Central Visual Pathways  Signals are conveyed via the retinal ganglion cells up the optic nerve, and into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus.  Before reaching the LGN, some of the fibres of the optic nerve cross over at the optic chiasm.  After a synapse in the LGN, visual signals are then sent to the primary visual cortex (located around the calcarine sulcus).  What nerves cross at the optic chiasm?            Information from the left visual field is sent to the right visual cortex and vice versa.      Note that this is NOT THE SAME as having everything from the right eye go to the left visual cortex (this DOESN’T happen).      What actually happens is that everything on the left side of what you see goes to the right cortex, and vice versa. This is confusing, because the image information from the left visual field enters both the left and right eyes.      Hence, the fibres that actually cross are as follows:                  Information from the left visual field going into the left eye.          Information from the right visual field going into the right eye.                    Note that, as shown below, the L &amp; R visual field is defined by the fixation point that your eyes are focused on.      Clinical Correlations  Given the above crossing pattern, we can make some predictions as to what clinical findings we’d see with different pathologies.Example 1  Below, the L optic nerve is cut, so we don’t see anything from the L eye.  On the bottom right, the figure shows the visual deficit experienced by the patient, NOT the portion of the retina that’s affected.  Because you can receive information from both the L &amp; R visual field from both eyes, you’d end up with the following:          No information from the L or R visual field coming into the L eye.      Information from both the L and R visual field coming into the R eye.        Hence, we have blindness in the L eye.Example 2  Here, the optic chiasm is split in two.  Now, what we lose is the information crossing the optic chiasm. As before:          Information from the left visual field going into the left eye.      Information from the right visual field going into the right eye.Note that temporal and nasal refer to the lateral and medial sides of the each visual field respectively.        This results in the visual defect shown below → bitemporal hemianopsia.          When you close the R eye, you lose the L visual field.      When you close the L eye, you lose the R visual field.        Recall that this was a common finding with large pituitary adenomas, which compress the optic chiasm.Example 3  Here, the R optic tract is cut.  Note that optic nerve = before the optic chiasm, while optic tract = after the optic chiasm.  Since the R optic tract receives the information from the L visual fields of both eyes, you end up losing the L visual field information from both eyes.  This results in a finding called left homonymous hemianopsia.          Homonymous = same on both sides.      Hemianopsia = half cannot see.        Remember      Optic nerve = before the optic chiasm.    Optic tract = after the optic chiasm.  Projections of the Optic Tract  90% of the optic tract axons go to the LGN of the thalamus (top right)  The other 10% go to the midbrain (bottom right), to 2 particular regions:          Superior colliculus (guides orientation).      Edinger-Westphal Nucleus (for the pupillary light reflex).        Note that the Edinger-Westphal nucleus mediates the pupillary light reflex, and not the LGN.          Hence, you don’t need a functioning thalamus to have a functional pupillary light reflex!        The LGN is composed of 6 layers:          Layers 1-2 receive information from magnocellular cells.      Layers 3-6 receive information from parvocellular cells.      This is a continuation of the functional division that we saw in the processing in the retina.      Furthermore, the information from each eye remains segregated at this point (each layer is monocular).      In other word, although layers 1 and 2 both receive information from magnocellular cells, they receive this information from a different eye.      Convergence only happens at the level of the visual cortex.        Recall from the previous lecture that:          Magnocellular (M) ganglion cells receive information mainly from rods in the peripheral retina.      Parvocellular (P) ganglion cells receive information mainly from cones in the fovea.      In addition, since the rods are the light sensitive ones, the M-cells also project to the midbrain to mediate the pupillary light reflex and orientation.      Projections from the LGN  Neurons from the LGN project to the primary visual cortex.          This is via a fibre bundle called the optic radiation.      As mentioned before, the primary visual cortex is located along the calcarine sulcus in the occipital lobe.        SYNONYMS for the Primary Visual Cortex:           Striate cortex, V1, area 17  Recall from Introduction to Neurophysiology that layer 4 of the cortex is responsible for reciving information, and that layers 3 &amp; 5 are responsible for sending it.      Area 17 is based on the Brodmann classification we saw previously.      The term ‘striate cortex’ derives from the ‘stripy’ appearance of the cortical layers, due to intense input from LGN into layer 4 of the cortex.        Summary of the Path of Visual Information      Light    Photoreceptors              Rods        Cones              Bipolar Cell    Retinal Ganglion Cell              Magnocellular (M) Cells correspond mainly to rods.        Parvocellular (P) Cells correspond mainly to cones.              Optic Nerve    Optic Chiasm              Information from the left visual field in both eyes go to the right side.        Information from the right visual field in both eyes go to the left side.              Optic Tract → the name for the optic ‘nerve’ past the chiasm.    Lateral Geniculate Nucleus → 6 layers.              Layers 1-2 receive information from the M cells.        Layers 3-6 receive information from the P cells.        Projections also go to the midbrain instead of the LGN, to the superior colliculus and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (pupillary light reflex).              Optic Radiation    Primary Visual Cortex  Processing in the Primary Visual CortexRetinotopy  The retina contains an orderly representation of the visual world, which is carried forward up the visual pathway (LGN, V1, and beyond).  Retinotopy describes how the retina is mapped to a given structure.          Note that this isn’t a one-to-one representation of the visual world; there is an over-representation of the fovea, where the majority of photoreceptors are located.      Almost 50% of V1 is devoted to processing images from the area at or near the fovea.        Retinotopy in V1:            Going from superficial to deep in V1, we go from central to peripheral. In other words, the superficial regions of V1 correspond to the areas near the fovea, and the deep regions correspond to the peripheral retina.      Furthermore, below the calcarine sulcus is the region corresponding to the upper visual field, and above the calcarine sulcus is the region corresponding to the lower visual field.      Types of V1 Neurons  V1 neurons respond to specific stimulus features, such as orientation, movement, and size.  These representations can be demonstrated through neurophysiological recordings pioneered by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel (Nobel prize, 1981)            They recorded the brain of animals while they displayed visual stimuli, such as moving bars of light.      The observed neurons that would only emit action potentials from bars that were oriented vertically, for example.      From these studies, they identified 3 types of cells.        Classes of V1 Neurons          Simple Cells → respond to preferred orientation.      Complex Cells → respond to preferred orientation AND direction.      Hyper-complex Cells → respond to preferred orientation AND direction AND size.        See the below video for an example (super cool):          Simple Cell → see clip from 1:50 to 3:00.      Complex-cell → see clip from 7:15 to 8:00      Hyper-complex cell → → 9:00 to 9:35, 10:30 to 11:00        Neurons in V1      Simple Cells → respond to ORIENTATION.    Complex Cells → respond to ORIENTATION + DIRECTION.    Hyper-complex Cells → respond to ORIENTATION + DIRECTION + SIZE.    These neurons are simple feature detectors, much like the centre-surround organization seen in the retinal ganglia.  As we move further and further away from the retina, we end up seeing more complicated feature detectors (eg. face recognition, place recognition, etc),  This also relates to the nature of the deficits seen following lesions in different parts of the central visual pathways.Formation of V1 Neurons  How do these V1 neurons obtain these characteristics?          This is through the convergence of simpler feature detectors, as shown below.        SIMPLE CELLS:          Simple cells are are built by the convergence of centre-surround cells.      As mentioned before, these cells recognize edges by having the centre of the receptive field respond differently from the surrounding area.      By integrating information from a series of centre-surround cells detecting an edge, you can detect the orientation of that edge.          COMPLEX CELLS:          Complex cells are built by the convergence of centre-surround cells.      Here, by knowing the orientation of an edge at multiple points, you can observe the translation of an edge, and its rotation.      This lets you detect the direction of that edge.        HYPER-COMPLEX CELLS:          Hyper-complex cells are built by the *convergence of complex cells.      As before, by integrating information from simpler feature detectors, they can detect size.      Hypercolumns in V1  As mentioned above, the retina is projected onto V1 with the central retina projecting superficially, and the peripheral retina projecting deeply.  This ‘map’ is split up into hypercolumns, which each correspond to information from one small part of the retina.  Adjacent hypercolumns assess adjacent regions on the retina.  As was said before, this isn’t a one-to-one mapping of the visual field; the fovea is grossly overrepresented.  Structure of the Hypercolumns          Information from the LGN enters each hypercolumn at layer 4 of the cortex (as mentioned before, this was the layer that receives information).      The separate information from the L &amp; R eye then converge, via the simple and complex cells located immediately above and below layer 4.      This convergence leads to stereopsis (our sense of depth).      The mechanism behind this convergence is described right below.      Ocular Dominance Columns  80% of all V1 neurons respond to input from both eyes (binocular).          However, most respond better to one eye.      This preferential response is called ocular dominance.        Within a hypercolumn, cells with the same ocular dominance are organized into columns. These alternate across hypercolumns.          In other words, one row of hypercolumns will be left-dominant, and the adjacent row will be right-dominant.      The interface between the left-dominant row and the right-dominant row lets us compare findings between the two; this is the basis for stereopsis.      Features Derived from Hypercolumns  STEREOPSIS           As mentioned before, this is depth perception.      Obtained by the convergence of monocular cells predisposed to different eyes.      Because the ocular dominance columns alternate as described above, you get convergence at the junction points.        COLOUR           At the centre of each hypercolumn is a blob (seriously).      These blobs contain colour-sensitive double-opponent cells that let us distinguish between different shades of a colour.      Contrast this with the colour-opponent cells we saw in the retina, that let us distinguish between completely different colours, but not different shades.        ORIENTATION OF LINE SEGMENTS           Radiating from each blob are segments of simple and complex cells arranged in a pinwheel pattern.      This means that a different segment of the column will ‘light up’ when you see a feature at a specific orientation.      Clinical Aspects of V1  What happens if vision is deprived in one eye?          The image on the right shows the V1 of a normal monkey, where a tracer has been injected into one eye, and has traveled into V1.                    The white section corresponds to the region that got tracer; the black section corresponds to the region that didn’t.          Note that there is ‘zebra-striping’ of the primary visual cortex; there is even spacing between the ocular dominance columns, suggesting that both are similarly used.                    The image on the right here shows the V1 of a monkey that has been deprived of vision in one eye for 22 months.                    Here, the tracer was injected into the non-deprived eye (white), while the deprived eye had nothing injected (black).          Note that the black stripes from the deprived eye are much thinner than the white stripes. The non-deprived eye has ‘taken over’ V1.                    This suggests a USE IT OR LOSE IT phenomena; the region of cortex devoted to the side that was unused was lost.      CLINICAL CORRELATION → Amblyopia (cortical blindness).      Amblyopia  In infants, input from the two eyes compete for space in V1. If one eye sees poorly, then the dominant eye will take over.          In extreme cases, the non-dominant eye will lose all cortical representation; this leads to amblyopia (cortical blindness, or lazy eye).      Here, the issue isn’t with the afferents or efferents to the eye, but with the cortical destination of the information.        Common Treatment → PATCHING the dominant eye.          By patching the dominant eye, you give the weak eye an opportunity to ‘catch-up’.        Amblyopia is a particularly big problem in the first years of life, where V1 is particularly plastic.          It is not an issue later in life, because V1 is not nearly as plastic.      A similar deprivation in an adult (eg. a cataract in one eye) will not product amblyopia.      Strabismus  The most common cause of amblyopia is STRABISMUS.          Strabismus that is left untreated leads to amblyopia.        Strabismus → the two eyes do not align on the same image.          Here, visual acuity is normal, but there is a misalignment of the eyes, resulting in double vision.        How can strabismus lead to amblyopia?          Binocular cells are important for stereopsis (the sense of visual depth).      With strabismus, although each eye retains its V1 representation intially, binocular cells are never activated simultaneously by the same stimulus.      This is because the misalignment prevents us from observing ‘like’ features between the two eyes.      As a result, all cells eventually become monocular, and the child will permanently lose stereopsis.      Over time, ths image from one eye may actually become suppressed to get rid of the double vision, and you end up with amblyopia.        This is another example of Hebbian Plasticity:          Cells that fire together, wire together.      Without simultanous activation due to misalignment, you have no strengthening of the signal, and no development of the binocular cells.        Summary of V1        The primary visual cortex (V1) separates an image into distinct feature channels.    Different groups of cells work collectively to extract a particular feature.              Cells in blobs extract colour.        Binocular cells extract depth cues.        Simple and complex cells detect edges and simple motion.            Visual Processing Beyond V1  Higher‐order visual areas are collectively termed extra‐striate visual cortex.          From V1, information is relayed to V2, and then V3 (makes sense).      After V1, information then splays out into a host of other areas; over 3 dozen different visual areas!      Each of these different visual areas processes one unique feature; these could include facial recognition, or object recognition.      We’ll be discussing a few of these areas.      Visual Streams  After going from V1 → V2 → V3, information goes into a multitude of different areas.  However, these areas can be divided into 2 streams:          Dorsal Stream → responsible for ‘WHERE + ACTION’ processing.      Ventral Stream → responsible for ‘WHAT’ processing.        The dorsal stream, as its name suggests, projects to the dorsal surface fo the brain (posterior parietal cortex).          It selects actions depending on your position in space, and is hence the ‘where/action’ stream.      Hence, it’s involved in assessing where you are, and how you should go about doing actions based on that information.      Information going into the dorsal stream mainly comes from larger M-ganglion cells; this makes sense, since these are faster, and involved the light-sensitive rods.        The ventral stream projects to the inferior temporal lobe:          It is involved in the perception and recognition of objects (eg. faces, places, tools), and is hence the ‘what/perception’ stream.      Information going into the ventral stream mainly comes from smaller P-ganglion cells; this also makes sense, since these involve the colour sensitive cones, and the visually acute fovea.        Visual Streams for Processing      After visual information goes from V1 → V2 → V3, it splits into either a dorsal or ventral stream:                               Dorsal Stream        Ventral Stream                            Location        Dorsal (Posterior Parietal Cortex)        Ventral (Inferior Temporal Lobe)                    Function        Where/action        What (recognition)                    Source of information        M-ganglion cells        P-ganglion cells            Examples of Ventral Stream (WHAT) Regions  Lateral Occipital Cortex           Early part of the ventral stream (= WHAT).      It encodes objects (but not faces, or places; these are a separate location).      Lesions of the LOC produce visual agnosia; the inability to perceive objects through vision.      Patients can see the object’s form, and even copy it, but can’t identify the object or its use through vision.      Interestingly, the deficit is limited to vision only; patients can still identify objects by other senses (eg. they can distinguish between a knife and fork by touch).        Fusiform Face Area           Further on in the ventral stream; as its name suggests, it’s involved in face encoding.      Lesions of the FFA result in prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize faces (even their own).      Amazingly, patients can still recognize features of a face (lips, eyebrows, nose), since that’s governed by the LOC mentioned just above.      Just like before, this deficit is vision specific; patients can still recognize people by features like their voice, smell, or even their gait.      Examples of Dorsal Stream (ACTION) Regions  Area MT (Middle Temporal)           This is a key component of the dorsal stream, and it plays a role in analyzing visual motion.      A lesion of MT impairs the automatic perception of motion.      As a result, visual motion becomes a series of snap-shots.      This is pretty debilitating; won’t be able to drive, cross street, etc.        Posterior Parietal Cortex           Involved in producing actions.      Lesions of the dorsal stream at the parietal lobe produce action-based deficits.      For instance, patients with parietal lobe lesions can exhibit optic ataxia: they can recognize an object, but cannot reach to it accurately in the periphery, even though motor function is unimpaired.      So if you had an injury to your L parietal lobe (dorsal stream), you wouldn’t be able to grab something in your R visual field.      In other words, they cannot coordinate their actions with what they see on the retina. They can do the movement just fine, but they have issues guiding their hand to the right location.      Integration of the Two Streams  We have shown that:          The dorsal stream is excellent at determining the direction of motion, but is very poor at determining fine features.      The ventral stream is excellent at extracting features, but is very poor at determining aspects of motion.        Hence, information from both streams is necessary for determining what an object is, and where it’s going.  Much with much of what we’ve seen earlier, this is yet another example of division of labour and the integration of multiple discrete features.Summary  Predictable visual deficits follow lesions of the central visual pathways.  Retinotopy, found in V1 and beyond, devotes a disproportionately large area of tissue to information from the fovea.  Detection of progressively more complex visual features continues in V1 and beyond.  Stereopsis (depth perception) arises in V1 with balanced input from each eye.          Failure of this during development, perhaps due to strabismus, may result in amblyopia.        Higher‐order visual processing accomplished by two separate visual streams:.          Dorsal “action” or “where” pathway concerned with spatial aspects of an object.      Ventral “perception” or “what” pathway concerned with object recognition and perception.

	{"title": "Neurophysiology of the Eye", "text": "Lecture Overview  The next 2 lectures will focus exclusively on the neurophysiology of the visual system.          The first lecture will focus on phototransduction (the conversion of photon reception into action potentials).      The next lecture will focus on the CNS pathways that interpret visual information.      Fundamental Components of the Visual System  Eye  Retina  Optic nerves, optic chiasm, optic tract  Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)  Primary Visual Cortex (V1, or Striate Cortex)  Extrastriate Visual CortexThe EyeAnatomy of the EyeAnterior View  Pupil → the black spot in your eye through which light goes through.  Iris → what regulates the size of your pupil (via dilation or constriction).  Cornea → the transparent covering the pupil and iris.  Extraocular muscles → moves the eye around, so the most sensitive areas are pointed towards areas of interest.  Retina → a light sensitive layer of tissue covering the inside of the eye. This is where photoreception occurs.  Optic nerve → where all the sensory neurons from the retina converse and exit the eye, and head towards the brain.Cross-Section  Lens → can change shape to refract light such that an image converges directly onto the retina.  Aqueous Humour → the fluid located between the cornea and lens.  Vitreous Humour → the more gelatinous substance between the lens and retina.  Fovea → the region on your retina with the sharpest vision (the most photoreceptors are located here).Focusing Light on the Retina  As mentioned above, the lens is used to refract light such that an image converges on the retina.  When you’re looking far away, light rays are coming at a shallower angle, so the lens does not need to be too convex to focus light onto the retina.  On the other hand, when you’re looking closely at something, the lens must be more convex (‘fatter’) in order to obtain focus.  The shape of the lens is controlled by ciliary muscles, which are connected to the lens by zonule fibres.  This is why your eyes get tired when you look at close objects for a long period of time!           When the muscles are relaxed, the lens is flat. This is unaccomodated, and is used for distance points.      When the muscles are contracted, the lens becomes fat. This is accommodated, and is used for near points.        Think of the ciliary muscles like ‘purse strings’. when you pull on them, the purse gets scrunched up; and when you loosen them, the purse becomes flatter.  Remember      Unaccomodation → when the ciliary muscles are relaxed, and the lens is thus flat. This is used to look at points that are far away.    Accomodation → when the ciliary muscles are contracted, and the lens is thus fat. This is used to look at points that are close by.  Corrective Lenses  Corrective Lenses → used when you have difficulty focusing light on the retina.          Myopia → aka. near-sightedness (can focus on near images, but not distant).      Hyperopia → aka. far-sightedness (can focus on distant images, but not near).        With myopia, the lens is too ‘fat’ when looking at distant objects, so light converges anterior to the retina. In this case, a concave lens can be used to diverge the light such that it hits the retina precisely.  Similarly, with hyperopia, the lens is too ‘flat’ when looking at close objects, so light converges posterior to the retina. In this case, a convex lens can be used to refocus the light.  As you age, your lens becomes less elastic, and remains too flat for near images, even when the ciliary muscles are completely contracted.  When this happens, images of near objects are blurred, and reading glasses are required.  What happens when myopic people get older, and also can’t see close objects?            If you’re near-sighted when you’re younger, and then begin losing your close-up vision, what can you do?      If you stuck with corrective lenses as above, you’d have to constantly change from a concave to convex lens when changing from far to close vision!      This is when bifocal glasses are useful (invented by Ben Franklin).      With bifocal glasses, the top half is more concave for looking at distant objects, and the bottom half is more convex for looking at close objects.      The Iris and the Pupillary Light Reflex  The iris contricts in bright light, so that the pupil becomes smaller and fewer rays of light enter.  This is termed the pupillary light reflex, and it functions to prevent the light-sensitive photoreceptors from being saturated by too much light.  Reducing the pupil diamater can also help sharpen an image, much like how narrowing the aperture on a camera increases the depth of field.  In order for the reflex to function, you need a normal afferent signal (via the optic nerve), and a normal efferent signal (via the oculomotor nerve).          Hence, the direct and consensual reflexes are a good test to assess CN II &amp; III.      The RetinaCell Types of the Retina  There are 5 cell types in the retina:            Photoreceptors → 2 types:                  Rods → light-sensitive.          Cones → colour-senstive (3 types, 1 per primary colour).          Mnemonic: C goes with C (cones, colour).                    Ganglion Cells → there are the only cells that actually produce action potentials.                  Hence, the ganglion cells function as the output neurons, whose axons comprise the optic nerve.                    Bipolar Cells → connect the photo-receptors and the ganglion cells.                  Hence, these connect the cells that receive the signal to the cells that output it.          Recall that we saw these in Introduction to Neuroanatomy, in contrast to multipolar and unipolar neurons.                    Horizontal Cells      Amacrine Cells        The horizontal and amacrine cells are responsible for some degree of image processing; this actually begins in the retina, and not the brain.          This is termed lateral information flow.        Remember      There are 5 cell types in the retina:              Photoreceptors → rods + cones.        Bipolar Cells → connect photoreceptors to ganglion cells.        Ganglion Cells → output the signal via the optic nerve.        Horizontal Cells        Amacrine Cells.              A signal travels from the photoreceptors → bipolar cell → ganglion cell, up the optic disc.    Horizontal cells and amacrine cells regulate the activity of multiple photoreceptor cells, and allow for some degree of image processing.  Phototransduction  Phototransduction is the process that converts light energy (photons) into neural signals.  Rods and cones have photo‐sensitive molecules in the outer segment that are sensitive to particular wavelengths of light.  Arrival of an appropriate photon triggers an amplifying cascade which produces a receptor potential in the photoreceptor. This amplification makes the receptors so sensitive that we can see a flash from a single photon.  Absorption of a photon triggers a molecular cascade that closes Na+ channels.          Less Na+ in results in hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor, releasing less neurotransmitter at the other end of the photoreceptor (the inner segment).        Darkness does the opposite; it opens the Na+ channels.          More Na+ flooding in results in depolarization of the receptor, releasing more neurotransmitter on the other end.        THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU’D EXPECT.          In most systems, you’d effect a stimulus to lead to depolarization; here it actually leads to hyperpolarization.      Cones vs Rods  Cones are primarily found at the fovea, the part of the retina that we use to see with high detail.          Cones are responsible for colour vision, but are less sensitive to light (they have a smaller outer segment, where photo-sensitive pigment is located).      At the fovea, there are exclusively cones; there aren’t any rods. Hence, we see colours best at the fovea.        Rods are primarily found at the peripheral retina.          Rods are responsible for light sensitivity; they have a larger outer segment, and hence are more sensitive to light.      Hence, we can see light okay throughout the retina, except for the fovea.        Because the fovea has no rods, you can actually see dimmer things better when you don’t directly focus on them, and instead keep them in your periphery. You can try this when you’re looking at dim stars while star-gazing.  Cones vs Rods                             Cones        Rods                            Function        Colour Sensitivity        Light Sensitivity                    Primary Location        Fovea        Peripheral Retina                    Size        Smaller (small outer segment)        Larger (large outer segment)            Finding your Blind Spot  At the optic nerve, there are no photo-receptors; hence this is a blind spot.          Recall that light has to travel through the other cells in order to hit the photo-receptors.      Because of that, where the axons of the ganglion cells converge to form the optic nerve, no light can pass through.      Normally this isn’t an issue, because we have 2 eyes, and the blind spots don’t overlap.      When we close our eyes, the blind spot does appear, but our brain masks it by ‘filling in the gap’.        We can see this with the demonstration on the right:            Close your right eye, and focus on the ‘X’ at the right.      Move your screen closer to you until the circle disappears.      At this point, the light from the circle is hitting the optic nerve, where there aren’t any photoreceptors; this causes it to disappear (whoaaa).        We can also assess how the brain ‘fills in’ the gap:            Do the same thing now, except this time, note that the space where the dot was is now black.      In other words, the brain filled in the blind spot with the background colour!      Visual Acuity at the Fovea  As mentioned before, the fovea only contains cones, and is thus highly sensitive to colour.  THIS IS ALSO THE AREA OF THE EYE WITH THE HIGHEST VISUAL ACUITY.  There are a few reasons for this.          Fewer cells to travel through                   At the fovea, the cells that normally lie on top of the photoreceptors (bipolar cells, ganglia cells), are pushed to the side.          This is why the fovea is a pit; the cells on top are pushed to the margins of the fovea.          Since there are fewer things blocking the photoreceptors, light scatters less, and our visual acuity improves.                    Ganglion cells at the fovea have a smaller receptive field                  A ganglion cell at the peripheral retina receives converging information from many widely-spaced photoreceptors. This produces a large receptive field (~3° of visual angle).          In contrast, a ganglion cell at the fovea receives convering information from a few closely-packed photoreceptors. This produces a small receptive field (~0.3° of visual angle).          As a result, when 2 photons about a degree apart hit photoreceptors at the periphery, they’ll feed to a single ganglion cell, which will only register 1 point of light.          On the other hand, when the same happens at the fovea, since the receptive field is narrower, you’ll see 2 points of light.          This is a similar idea to how the body has different 2-point discrimination at the hands versus the legs (the hands are more sensitive to touch).                     Retinal Ganglion CellsDon’t confuse these with the magnocellular and parvocellular neurons we saw in Endocrinology, which come from the hypothalamus innervate the pituitary. Magno- just means big, and parvo- just means small; there’s no association.  As mentioned before, the retinal ganglion cells are the cells that ultimately output a signal to the brain.  These retinal ganglion cells fall into 2 main classes.            P-cells (Parvocellular Cells)                  Sensitive to colour, so mainly receive from cones.          Smaller receptive fields (as mentioned above).          Smaller, slower conducting.          Comprise 90% of ganglion cells (most of our ganglion cells are concentrated at the fovea).                    M-cells (Magnocellular Cells)                  Not sensitive to coour, mainly receive from rods.          Larger receptive fields.          Larger, faster conducting.          5-10% of all ganglion cells.          Best activated by transient, moving stimuli (this makes sense, since they largely receive from our peripheral vision).                      Because the two ganglion cells largely receive different types of inputs, we are already extracting different features from the world at the level of the retina.          As we move up the visual pathway, we’ll see how more and more complex feature extraction works.      These cell types also project to different layers of the LGN (recall, lateral geniculate nucleus, part of thalamus that receives vision), which reflects a compartmentalization that we see throughout the visual system.        P-cells vs M-cells                             Parvocellular (P) Cells        Magnocellular (M) Cells                            Receives from        Cones (colour)        Rods (light)                    Size        Small (hence parvo-)        Large (hence magno-)                    Receptive Field        Small        Large                    Conduction speed        Slower        Faster                    Additional features        Comprise 90% of ganglion cells        Best activated by transient, moving stimuli            Why is it difficult to read in low Illumination?  You usually use your fovea to read; the region of the eye with the most visual acuity.  However, the fovea is also less sensitive to light, so in dim lighting, you have to rely more on your peripheral retina.  Hence, you have to rely on your less acute regions of vision to read (another way of illustrating this: try reading an entire line of text without moving your eyes; you should see how the acuity falls off with increasing distance from the fovea).Assessing Vision  In summary, at the fovea, we have the most visual acuity and sensitivity to colour, but poorer sensitivity to light.  In contrast, in the periphery, we have the least visual acuity and colour sensitivity, but the most sensitivity to light.  When we assess vision, our tests reflect this:          Letter Chart (Snellen Chart)                  Done to assess visual acuity, so we test the fovea.          Hence, it’s done in bright light, and you’re allowed to move your eyes to focus light onto the fovea.                    Visual Field Test                  Done to assess the function of the rods in the periphery.          Here, you fixate on one point, so you have to rely on your peripheral vision.          The patient presses a button whenever they see a flash in the periphery (hence, only light sensitivity is assessed).          Areas of the visual field that do not elicit a button press are called scotomas (blind spots), and indicate a visual deficit.                    Colour Vision  We have 3 cones; their names correspond to the wavelength at which they have peak sensitivity (red, green, blue).  However, the absorption spectrum for each is actually quite wide, and they can overlap. This overlap helps differentiate more subtle hues.  Since we have 3 types of cones, we have trichromatic vision.Colour Blindness  2% of males lack the red or green pigment          They are referred to as red-green colour blind, and are dichromats, since they only have 2 types of cones.      They would not be able to see the number on the right, because the only difference between the red and green in the image is hue (they have the same intensity).        6% of males have all 3 pigments, but the green pigment is shifted towards the red one.          These are referred to as anomalous trichromats; they are trichromats, but they aren’t as sensitive to differences between red and green as the general population.        Hence, in total, about 8% of the male population has some form of colour blindness, as opposed to only about 0.5% of females.          This is because it often has an X-linked inheritance pattern.        Dichromats (2%) are missing one cone type,  Monochromats (rare) are missing two cone types,  Achromats (very rare) are missing all cone types.Visual Processing in the RetinaProcessing Changes in Intensity  We saw that multiple photoreceptors converse to a single ganglion cell.  However, this wasn’t the complete story; photoreceptors that connect to the same ganglion cell are NOT treated in the same way.  In fact, their response to light input can be inhibitory or excitatory depending on the location of the photo-receptor on their receptive field.  More formally, they have a centre-surround organization, which is mediated by the actions of the bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells (which we mentioned before).          What this means is that the centre of the receptive field is treated differently as the surrounding area.      Centre-surround organization can either be on-centre or off-centre.        On-centre → where the centre of the receptive field is stimulated by light (hence it’s turned ‘on’), and the surrounding area is inhibited.  Off-centre → the opposite, where the centre of the receptive field is inhibited by light (hence it’s turned ‘off’), and the surrounding area is stimulated.  Why is a centre-surround organization useful?    (Random aside) This idea is similar to how you convolve a signal with a Laplacian of a Gaussian filter in image processing!          It allows you to ACCENTUATE EDGES!      When you cross an edge where one side is dark, and the other side is bright, you can stimulate both the centre and the surrounding area of the receptive field in the same way.      This gives you a more accentuated stimulatory or inhibitory effect.      Artists actually exploit this by darkening one side of an edge, and lightening the other.      This is also why we see illusory ‘bands’ around edges, where the darker side of the edge looks darker than the surrounding area, and vice versa.        Center‐surround also aids in constancy, by measuring the change across an edge, rather than absolute light levels.  This helps letters on a page stand out whether you are indoors in dim light or outdoors in bright sun.  This occurs despite the background indoors being darker than the letter outdoors!Processing Changes in Hue  With cones, we have a similar organization with colour-opponent cells.  In these cells, the presence of a specific wavelength in the surrounding area inhibits the response to another wavelength in the centre.  Hence, this helps detect edges between colours (different wavelengths).  However, it does a poor job of detecting edges between similar colours (similar wavelengths); this is something that the primary visual cortex plays a role in.3 Diseases of the Eye  Cataracts → clouding of the lens.          Here, vision everywhere is affected equally, because the clouding results in blurring of the light in a uniform manner.        Glaucoma → disorders that result in optic nerve damage.          Most typically caused by increased intraocular pressure.      The periphery is affected more because you have fewer axons there; this results in tunnel vision.        Macular Degeneration → deposits underneath the retina affect vision.          These deposits (fatty/blood vessels), predominantly affect the fovea first.      As a result, we lose central vision first.      These deposits also distort the retinal sheath, resulting in image distortion.        Summary of the Eye      The eye does three things:              It focuses the image on the retina. Image focus depends on lens shape, pupil diameter, shape (length) of eye, lens clarity, and if the image lands on the fovea.        It detects light of various colours and intensities        It compresses the information in order to send it down the optic nerve. Compressions occurs by:                      A detailed image is sent only from a small part of the eye, which is the fovea.            Through retinal processing of an image, we’re particularly sensitive to edges.                                What the eye sends the brain is a poor reflection of the original image, yet we perceive our visual world with clarity. This is done by the visual cortex, the topic of the next lecture  ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/18/neurophysiology-eye.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Neurophysiology", "text": "Introduction to the Brain  Much of this lecture is review, but it aims to bring everyone onto the same page for subsequent lectures.  An adult human brain contains 100 billion neurons, and 10x as many glia cells.          Gray Matter → neurons.      White Matter → axons.        Just like the 6-degrees of separation concept, there are at most 4 degrees of separation between any pair of neurons in the brain.  If you took all the white matter in the brain, and strung it end to end, you’d have something that’s several million miles in total length.          Hence, sending action potentials across this massive network is energetically expensive; only a small percentage of neurons are active at any one time.      The brain, which is only 1-3% of your total body mass, actually uses 20% of the body’s energy.      You would faint due to a lack of oxygen if more than 5% of your neurons were active at the same time!      Because of how hungry the brain is for energy, and decreases in oxygenation will often present with neurological findings first!        When a certain part of your gray matter is in use, blood is directed preferentially to that region.            This is the basis for fMRI (functional MRI) → deoxyhemoglobin is used as a contrast agent in order to visualize areas with high blood flow.      This lets you indirectly assess regions of high neurological activity.        Another method of imaging is Diffusion Tensor Imaging, which reveals the ‘connectome’ between the neurons in the brain.            This is useful in assessing conditions such as epilepsy, where a locus of abnormal activity can spread through these connections to other areas, resulting in a seizure.      Both fMRI and DTI have exploded in popularity for both basic and clinical research, and will continue to do so in the coming years.        Remember      fMRI (functional MRI) → assesses cortical activity indirectly, via blood flow.    DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) → assesses axonal connectivity.    NEUROMYTH → You only use 10% of your brain.          Myth → 90% of your brain power is just waiting to be untapped.      Origin is somewhat unclear:                  May have started from a misinterpretation of the works of William James by Dale Carnegie, who wrote the preface to Carnegie’s self-help book How to Win Friends and Influence People.          Could also have been a misinterpretation of the works of Karl Lashley and Wilder Penfield at the MNI (large areas of “silent” cortex are non-responsive to electrical stimulation).          May also be related to the 10:1 glia-to-neuron ratio (glial cells are any non-neuronal cells that supports/helps the neuron)                    Reality:                  FALSE; you use 100% of your brain!          The brain uses all available neural tissue, as has been verified by fMRI studies.          While not all of the brain is functioning at the same time, all of it is used.          Furthermore, minor brain damage can have devastating effects, which wouldn’t make sense if only 10% of your brain was being used.          “Silent” cortex is not so silent after all; newer studies show that these areas are functional.          Why would we evolve something we don’t use?                    Review of The Neuron  Neuron → the physiological functional unit of the nervous system.  Neurons and muscle cells are excitable; they can generate and respond to electrical signals.  Components of the Neuron:          Soma → cell body.      Axon → sends information via action potentials.      Dendrite → receives and integrates information.      Synapse → point of contact between neurons.        Neurons have a resting membrane potential of about -65 mV.          Depolarization → less negative than resting potential.      Hyperpolarization → more negative than resting potential.        Action potentials start at the axon hillock (the junction between the axon and the cell body), and continue all the way down to the axon terminal.          Once a threshold is reached, the action potential goes to completion; hence this is an all-or-none signal.      Propagation is accelerated by myelination, which permits skipping of the action potential from one Node of Ranvier to another (saltatory conduction).      Multiple Sclerosis → an example of a demyelinating disease of the CNS.                  Another example is Guillain-Barré syndrome, which affects the PNS.                      Remember      Multiple Sclerosis → demyelinating disease of the CNS.    Guillain-Barré Syndrome → demyelinating disease of the PNS.  Coding Sensory Information  This all-or-none concept is important with respect to the brain.          This means that the inputs to the brain are effectively only a series of 0s or 1s.      From this, how do you get such fine-grained perceptions of the world?        Some examples are listed below:          Frequency Coding → where the frequency of action potential firing is used to interpret stimulus. For instance, a soft stimulus will have slow axon potential firing, while a hard stimulus will have fast firing.      Population Coding → where the population of neurons that are firing is used to interpret stimulus.      Duration Coding → where the duration of the action potential firing is used to interpret stimulus.      Labeled Line Coding → information about sensory modality is conveyed along dedicated sensory pathways. (e.g., information sent through the optic nerve is interpreted as vision-related).      Circuit Principles  Convergence           Axonal branches of many neurons reach one target neuron for comparison or integration.      Relevant in sensory neuroscience for feature extraction.        Divergence           Axonal branches of one neuron reach many target neurons.      Relevant in motor control to ensure coordinate actions, and the contextual control of reflexes.        Remember      Convergence is important in the sensory system for feature extraction.    Divergence is important in the motor system for coordinating actions.  Chemical Synapses  SIGNAL INITIATION → Arrival of the action potential at the axon terminal triggers Ca2+ mediated release of a neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft:          Examples of neurotransmitters: Acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, etc.        SIGNAL RECEPTION → The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, producing a response.          These receptors can be grouped into 2 broad classes → ionotropic and metabotropic.                  Ionotropic → binding opens ion channels (fast action, local effects).          Metabotropic → actions are mediated through a second-messenger system (more widespread, longer-lasting effects). The canonical example are the GPCRs.                      SIGNAL TERMINATION → once the signal has been triggered, it also has to be stopped.          The method of termination differs depending on the neurotransmitter. Examples include (1) diffusion, (2) enzymatic destruction, or (3) re-uptake.      For instance, with acetylcholine, the ACh signal was broken down via acetylcholinesterase.        Receptor Subtypes      Ionotropic → binding opens ion channels, for fast &amp; local effects.    Metabotropic → binding triggers a downstream cascade, for widespread &amp; longer-lasting effects.  Ionotropic Responses  As mentioned above, these are fast, local effects.  EPSPs → Excitatory Post Synaptic Potentials.          Where the post-synaptic membrane is depolarized.      The major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain is glutamate.      The excitatory neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction is acetylcholine.      The NMDA receptors for glutamate are modifiable; this allows for synaptic plasticity (strengthening or weakening of the post-synaptic response). This is the foundation of learning and memory.          IPSPs → Inhibitory Post Synaptic Potentials.          Where the post-synaptic membrane is hyperpolarized.      The major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is GABA (GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid).      The inhibitory neurotransmitter at the spinal cord is glycine.      Many sedating or tranquilizing drugs target GABA receptors.          Summary of Ionotropic Responses                             EPSP (Excitatory)        IPSP (Inhibitory)                            Definition        Where the post-synaptic membrane is depolarized.        Where the post-synaptic membrane is hyperpolarized                    Corresponding Neurotransmitter(s)        Brain → glutamateNMJ → acetylcholine        Brain → GABASpinal Cord → glycine              Synaptic Integration → multiple EPSPs and IPSPs can be summed up over space (spatial summation) and time (temporal summation) by the downstream neuron.          The net effect of the EPSPs and IPSPs may or may not be enough to trigger a downstream action potential; this is how multiple signals are integrated.       Metabotropic Responses  As mentioned above, these are longer-lasting, widespread effects.  With metabotropic receptors, actions are mediated through a second messenger system.  For example, G-protein coupled receptors can alter cellular metabolism, regulate ion channel function, or trigger widespread metabolic effects. This is another pathway for synaptic plasticity.  Examples include receptors for dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.  The systems that govern our emotions are largely controlled by metabotropic responses.Neuropharmacology  There are many neurotransmitters (&gt; 50 at last count), but they generally fall into 3 categories:          Amino Acids → eg. GABA, glutamate, glycine.      Amines → Acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.      Peptides → Substance P (associated with pain &amp; inflammation), dynorphin (opioid).        Drugs that affect the brain affect the receptors for these transmitters, or how they get eliminated.Examples of Neuroreceptors  We’ll be looking at two neat neuroreceptors:          GABAA receptor.      NMDA receptor.      1. GABAA Receptor  GABAA Receptor → inhibitory ionotropic receptor in the brain.          Recall that we saw previously that GABA was the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.        One GABA receptor is the GABAA receptor.  On this receptor, there are multiple binding sites, for different agonists.          Some of these include ethanol, barbituates, and benzodiazepines.      That’s why all of these make you sleepy. They all stimulate an inhibitory receptor!      Since they also bind to different regions on the receptor, they can have multiplicative effects; this is why it’s dangerous to be on benzodiazepines and drink, for instance.        Many drugs also act on other receptors:          For instance, alcohol also antagonizes the glutamate receptors; recall that glutamate has an excitatory effect in the brain.      Hence, the depressive/sedating effect of alcohol is through two mechanisms → upregulation of inhibitory GABAA receptor activity, and downregulation of excitatory glutamate receptor activity.      2. NMDA Receptor  NMDA Receptor → excitatory ionotropic receptor in the brain. receptor for glutamate.          Recall that we saw previously that glutamate was the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.        The NMDA receptor has a neat feature → the receptor only opens if the cell is already depolarized.          This allows it to be used as a COINCIDENCE DETECTOR; it detects whether multiple excitatory signals are firing at the same time.      This coincidence detector then adjusts synaptic strength, so that synapses that fire together are strengthened.                  Hebbian Learning → cells that fire together, wire together          In other words, the NMDA receptor allows for the detection of signals that are firing in synchrony, allowing for strengthening of synapses that fire together, and the pruning of those that don’t.          Hence, this plays an important role in learning and plasticity.                    Hebbian learning is important in the development of stereopsis (depth perception).        NEUROMYTH → The brain is only plastic during critical periods.          Myth → for example, the first 3 years of a child’s life are decisive for later brain development and success.      Origin:                  Pioneering studies in animal behaviour on imprinting (e.g., in birds right after hatching)          Visual experience early in life determines how much of the visual cortex is devoted to processing input from each eye.                    Reality                   ONLY PARTIALLY TRUE. Although it’s true that the first 3 years of life are important for the development of some neurological systems (eg. sensory modalities), it is not generalizable to all learning.          The human brain retains plasticity throughout life. eg, recovery can follow brain damage, and new capacities can be learned throughout life (eg, London UK cab drivers have enlarged hippocampi, which plays a role in spatial memory).          Even in the sensory domains, the concept of a “critical period” is not so sharply defined (a better term may be “sensitive period”).                    Brodmann’s Areas  Gray matter consists of 6 anatomically distinct layers.            Information is received in layer 4.      Information is output in layers 3 &amp; 5.Recall that the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus relays sensory information to the primary visual cortex.        Hence, regions of the cortex that receive lots of information will have a thick layer 4; one example is the primary visual cortex.          In fact, the primary visual cortex is also called the striate cortex because of it’s thick layer 4.        Similarly, regions of the cortex that send lots of information will have thick layers 3 &amp; 5; one example is the primary motor cortex.  These cytological and histological differences are the basis for Brodmann’s Areas          More than 100 years ago, K Brodmann used differences in these cortical features to subdivide the brain into 52 different regions.      Examples include area 17 (the striate cortex), and area 4 (the primary motor cortex).      Continuing research shows that each area may even have functional subdivisions (eg. 3a, 3b, etc).        KEY POINT → different areas of the brain do different things, and these patterns of distribution are largely reproducible between people.            The classic example was the case of Phineas Gage, who was an American railway worker who had a tamping iron driven through his frontal lobe after an explosion.      Upon recovery, personality changes were observed, which suggested that different regions of the cortex had different functions.      Although he was considered the “index case” for personality changes due to frontal lobe damage, it’s now recognized that many of the behavioural claims were exaggerated to fit pet theories.

	{"title": "Basal Ganglia &amp; Diencephalon", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Identify the main structures that comprise the basal ganglia.  Compare the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways of the basal ganglia.  Know the major subdivisions of the thalamus, their main connections and primary function.  Describe the location and major functions of the hypothalamus and epithalamus.Review of the Cerebrum  Components of the Cerebrum:          Cerebral Cortex (Gray Matter)                  Superficial cortical layer of gray matter containing neuronal cell bodies                    Cerebral White Matter                  Deeper layer of white matter containing fibers connecting cell bodies to other cortical areas and the rest of the brain                    Deep Gray Matter                  Comprises the basal ganglia; the deepest layer of large collections of neuronal cell bodies.                    Basal Ganglia  Basal Ganglia → deep layer of neuronal cell bodies located in the cerebrum (deep gray matter).          Shown in pink on the right.      Note that this is c-shaped; as we discussed in Anatomy of the Cerebrum, the cerebrum develops embryologically as a c-shape.      Since the basal ganglia is part of the cerebrum, it follows this shape as well.      In coronal sections, since the caudate nucleus sort of loops around a bit, you can often see it represented twice.        Objective      Identify the main structures that comprise the basal ganglia.    Anatomically, it consists of the following:            Caudate nucleus.      Putamen.      Globus pallidus.      Amygdala.        Lentiform nucleus → refers to the putamen + globus pallidus.  Thalamus → just medial to the lentiform nucleus.  Caudate nucleus → has 3 parts: (1) Head, (2) Body, (3) Tail.  Amygdala → Although many anatomical texts refer to the amygdala as a separate structure, anatomically it should be considered part of the basal ganglia.          As can be seen on the right, this is a round structure on the tail of the caudate nucleus. (recall that cauda = tail).      The amygdala is part of the limbic system, which governs our emotions.        Functions of the Basal Ganglia:          Motor → coordinate speed and strength of movements.      Cognition, learning, emotions.        Today, we’ll be focusing primarily on the motor function of the basal ganglia.          This is what’s most applicable clinically; dysfunctions in the basal ganglia lead to movement disorders.      Anatomic Location of the Basal Ganglia  Below are coronal and transverse (horizontal) cross-sections of the brain.  Note that the insular cortex can easily be seen here as the gray matter that is covered by the parietal and temporal lobes.  Below is an coronal section at an anterior location on the basal ganglia.  Note that we don’t see the thalamus here:          This is because the thalamus is posteromedial relative to the lentiform nucleus, so it’s posterior to the level at which the cross section was taken (see right).        Note the anatomy of the lentiform nucleus:          The Putamen is more lateral.      The Globus pallidus is more medial.        Below is a transverse (horizontal) section through the basal ganglia.          Here, you can actually see the head of the caudate nucleus, and where it attaches to the lentiform nucleus.      You don’t see the body of the caudate because it’s superior to the level of the cross section.      But you do see the tail as the ‘C’ curves back into the plane.      You can also see the thalamus more medially (the unlabelled midline gray matter).        Note that the globus pallidus has 2 parts, which are involved in different motor control pathways.:          External      Internal        Anatomic Components of the Basal Ganglia      Basal Ganglia → putamen + globus pallidus + caudate nucleus + amygdala.    Lentiform Nucleus → globus pallidus + putamen.    Striatum → putamen + caudate nucleus.    Lentiform nucleus is comprised of 2 more functionally dissimilar parts (putamen and globus pallidus).    Striatum is comprised of 2 more functionally similar parts (putamen + caudate nucleus).    The Role of the Basal Ganglia in Motor Control  In Anatomy of the Cerebrum, we saw the different CNS centres that participate in motor control, including:  The ideomotor area was located in the Posterior Multimodal Assocation Area, where all of our sensory information is integrated.          Ideomotor area → where you get the idea to move.      Premotor Cortex → planning of complex motions.      Primary Motor Cortex → located on the precentral gyrus.        There are 3 more systems that are very important for motor control, including:          Basal ganglia.      Cerebellum.      Spinal reflexes.        Today we’ll be focusing on the basal ganglia, which will provide a good foundation on the anatomy and structure for a subsequent TBL.Direct &amp; Indirect Striopallidal Pathways  Objective      Compare the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways of the basal ganglia.    As we saw previously, the primary motor cortex sends commands down to the spinal cord, and eventually to the muscles.          However, these commands are modulated by other structures, including the basal ganglia.      For the basal ganglia, this regulation ensures that the motor cortex is set at an appropriate level of activity (ie. initiating movements at the right strength &amp; speed).        There are 2 pathways through the basal ganglia, which regulate the primary motor cortex:          Direct Striopallidal Pathway.      Indirect Striopallidal Pathway.        As their names suggest, they go through the striatum (caudate nucleus + putamen), and the globus pallidus.  Direct Striopallidal Pathway          This is a direct pathway of feedback, via the internal globus pallidus.      Pathway: INPUT from motor cortex → striatum → internal globus pallidus → thalamus → motor cortex regulation.      RED = inhibitory connections.      GREEN = excitatory connections.      Hence, the net result is excitatory feedback to the motor cortex:                  You can think of this as multiplying (+1)’s and (-1)’s for excitatory and inhibitory signals respectively.          Since there are 2 (+1) connections, and 2 (-1) connections, the net result is an excitatory feedback.                      Indirect Striopallidal Pathway          This is an indirect pathway of feedback, via the external globus pallidus.                  Here, there is an extra structure involved, called the subthalamic nucleus (part of the diencephalon).          Instead of going directly into the internal globus pallidus, the pathway first goes through the external globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus.                    Pathway: INPUT from motor cortex → striatum → external globus pallidus → subthalamic nucleus thalamus → internal globus pallidus → thalamus → motor cortex regulation.      Hence, the net result is inhibitory feedback to the motor cortex.        Through these two pathways, tone and activity for the motor cortex can be maintained.          Also shown in the above figure is the substantia nigra; which has a dopamine influence on the striatum, and also affects the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways.      This is important because the substantia nigra is the area that’s affected in Parkinson’s Disease.        Striopallidal Pathways      The DIRECT striopallidal pathway gives EXCITATORY feedback to the primary motor cortex.              It goes through the internal globus pallidus directly.              The INDIRECT striopallidal pathway gives INHIBITORY feedback to the primary motor cortex.              It goes through the external globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, before going into the internal globus pallidus.              To remember this, note that the two ‘I’s go together (indirect + inhibitory).  Disorders of the Basal Ganglia  Parkinson’s Disease → a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.          Results in understimulation of the motor cortex.      Symptoms include slow jerky movements, muscle rigidity, slow tremors, and bradykinesia (slow movement).        Huntington’s Disease → neuronal atrophy of the striatum (caudate nucleus + putamen).          In particular, this is a loss in the intrinsic inhibitory neurons, resulting in overstimulation of the motor cortex.      Symptoms are choreiform movements (brisk, jerky, purposeless movements of the limbs).        Schizophrenia → changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.          The nucleus accumbens is the basal part of the striatum, which connects to the lateral prefrontal cortex.      The nucelus accumbens is involved in motivational states and addictive behaviours.      Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, and disorded thoughts.      There is also often a deficit of normal emotional responses.        Disorders of the Basal Ganglia                    Disease        Cause        Symptoms                            Parkinson’s Disease        Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra        Slow jerky movements, muscle rigidity, slow tremors, bradykinesia                    Huntington’s Disease        Loss of the intrinsic inhibitory neurons in the striatum        Choreiform movements: brisk, jerky, purposeless movements of the limbs                    Schizophrenia        Changes in dopamind release in the nucleus accumbens, which connects to the lateral prefrontal cortex        Delusions, hallucination, disordered thoughts, deficit of normal emotional responses            Diencephalon  The diencephalon is comprised of 4 structures:          Thalamus      Hypothalamus      Epithalamus = Pineal      Subthalamus (includes subthalamic nucleus)        So everything in the diencephalon is defined by their relation to the thalamus.          The difference between hypothalamus and the subthalamus is that the hypothalamus is below the thalamus, while the subthalamus is at the base of the thalamus.        We saw the subthalamus and thalamus previously as part of the striopallidal pathways:          Both the direct and indirect pathway went through the thalamus.      The indirect pathway also went through the subthalamic nucleus (in the subthalamus).        Anatomically, the thalamus lies below the fibres of the corpus callosum, and lies in the midline of the brain.          However, even though it’s midline, the thalamus is a paired structure; there is a L and R thalamus.      The L &amp; R thalamus are mostly separated by the third ventricle, and are joined only by an area called the interthalamic adhesion.        The pineal gland (aka. epithalamus) is not only superior to the thalamus, but also posterior.  Above the thalamus is another important structure called the fornix, which plays an important role in the limbic system.  Above is the horizontal cross-section which we saw previously.  Note that the thalamus is the midline region of grey matter, that lies just medial to the globus pallidus and putamen.  Summary of the Diencephalon      The diencephalon includes:              Thalamus.        Hypothalamus.        Epithalamus (Pineal)        Subthalamus.              Of these, the thalamus is the largest, and is a midline structure comprised of two lobes connected by a midline interthalamic adhesion.  Subdivisions of the Thalamus  The thalamus connects to many parts of the cortex; you can think of it as a hub/relay for information going towards the cortex.          It also acts to filter the information that goes into the brain.        Hence, there are many subdivisions of the thalamus, which associate with different parts of the cortex.Categories of the Thalamic Nuclei  There are multiple nuclei in the thalamus, with different functions.  We categorize the nuclei in the thalamus by the cortical areas that they associate with.  Hence, as with the cortex, there are thalamic nuclei associated with:          Sensory      Motor      Association      Names of the Thalamic Nuclei  While the thalamic nuclei are categorized functionally, they’re named based on their anatomic location within the thalamus.  For example:          VA → Ventral Anterior Nucleus.      MD → Medial Dorsal Nucleus.      VPL → Ventral Posterior Lateral Nucleus.        Objective      Know the major subdivisions of the thalamus, their main connections and primary function.  Sensory Subdivisions of the Thalamus  There is a thalamic subdivision associated with every sensory modality in the cortex, with one exception.          OLFACTION GOES DIRECTLY INTO THE CEREBRAL CORTEX.      So every other sensory modality is relayed through the thalamus, with the exception of smell.        We’ll only be focusing on a subset of the sensory nuclei.  Examples of Sensory Nuclei:            Auditory Pathway → Medial Geniculate Body → Primary auditory cortex on superior temporal lobe.      Optic Tract → Lateral Geniculate Body → Primary visual cortex on the occipital lobe (either side of the calcarine sulcus).      Somesthetic from body → VPL (ventral posterior lateral) → primary somatosensory cortex in postcentral gyrus.      Somesthetic from head → VPM (ventral posterior medial) → primary somatosensory cortex in postcentral gyrus.        Sensory Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Associated Sense        Receives From        Goes To                            Medial Geniculate Body        Hearing        Auditory Pathway        Primary Auditory Cortex (superior temporal lobe)                    Lateral Geniculate Body        Vision        Optic Tract        Primary Visual Cortex (occipital lobe, either side of calcarine sulcus)                    VPL (Ventral Postero-lateral)        Somatosensory        Sensory innervation from BODY        Primary Somatosensory Cortex (post-central gyrus)                    VPM (Ventral Postero-medial)        Somatosensory        Sensory innervation from HEAD        Primary Somatosensory Cortex (post-central gyrus)            Motor Subdivisions of the Thalamus  Just like how sensory information from the rest of the body is relayed through the thalamus, motor output from the brain also goes through the thalamus.          We’ve already seen an example of this with the striopallidal pathways, which feed through the thalamus.        Examples of Motor Relay Nuclei:          VA (Ventral Anterior) → receives input from the globus pallidus (via the direct/indirect striopallidal pathways), and feeds back to the motor cortex.      VL (Ventral Lateral) → receives input from the cerebellum, and feeds back to the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex.        Motor Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Receives From        Goes To                            VA (Ventral Anterior)        Globus pallidus        Primary Motor Cortex                    VL (Ventral Lateral)        Cerebellum        Primary Motor Cortex &amp; Premotor Cortex            Association Subdivisions of the Thalamus  The association nuclei connect to some of the associations areas we saw in previous lectures.  Examples of Association Nuclei:          Anterior Nucleus → receives input from the limbic system (mammillary bodies), outputs to the cingulate gyrus.      MD Nucleus (Medial Dorsal) → receives input from the amygdala, outputs to the prefrontal cortex (~AMAA).      Pulvinar Nucleus → outputs to the parietal cortex (~PMAA).        Association Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Receives From        Goes To                            Anterior Nucleus        Limbic System (mammillary bodies)        Cingulate Gyrus                    MD (Medial Dorsal)        Amygdala        Prefrontal Cortex (~AMAA)                    Pulvinar Nucleus                 Parietal Cortex (~PMAA)            Hypothalamus &amp; Pituitary Gland  Objective      Describe the location and major functions of the hypothalamus and epithalamus.    The hypothalamus is like the thalamus in that it has a number of sub-nuclei, which each have different functions.          It controls thirst, temperature, satiety, and neuroendocrine release (through the pituitary).      It also integrates with the limbic system to mediate an autonomic response to an emotional stimulus (eg. how you start sweating when you’re afraid).        We won’t be looking at this in detail in this block (most of this was covered in Endocrinology).The Epithalamus (Pineal Gland)  The epithalamus looks like a little tail popping out from the back of the thalamus.  Primarily responsible for circadian rhythms by secreting melatonin at night.  It knows that it’s ‘nighttime’ via light input from the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus.  Summary of the Hypothalamus &amp; Epithalamus      The hypothalamus lies below the thalamus. The optic chiasm (crossing of optic nerve fibres) covers most of the basal hypothalamus.    The hypothalamus has multiple nuclei involved in autonomic control, satiety, body temperature and fluid balance. It is not necessary to know the names and function of these all of these nuclei.    Then hypothalamus sends autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) outputs through nuclei in the medulla.    The pituitary gland is connected to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk (infundibulum).    The pineal gland (epithalamus) is located immediately posterior to the thalamus and superior to the superior and inferior colliculi of the midbrain.    The pineal receives light information through a relay in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Based on the level of light, the pineal secretes melatonin at night and is involved in the control of circadian cycles and sleep.

V → Vagus (CN X).      A → (Spinal) Accessory Nerve (CN XI).      H → Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII).        Of these, 4 nerves carry parasympathetic innervation:          III → Oculomotor.      VII → Facial.      IX → Glossopharyngeal.      X → Vagus.        Some of these nerves play a role in our senses:          Olfactory Nerve (CN I) → smell.      Optic Nerve (CN II) → sight.      Facial &amp; Glossopharyngeal (CN VII, IX) → taste.      Vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) → hearing &amp; balance.      Functions of the Cranial Nerve  Unlike with the spinal nerves roots, where the dorsal roots are all sensory, and the ventral roots are all motor, the cranial nerves are a hodgepodge of motor and sensory innervation.  To remember these, use the following mnemonic:          Some Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Big Brains Matter Most.

The exception is the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII); it actually exits anteriorly to XI.

VII, VIII → Internal Acoustic Meatus.  IX, X, XI → Jugular Foramen.          Recall that the sigmoid sinus also runs through here, to become the internal jugular vein.        XII → Hypoglossal Canal.Summary of the Cranial NervesSensory Innervation of the Dura Mater  Objective      Outline the sensory nerve supply of the dura mater.    The dura mater has sensation, largely through the CN V (trigeminal).  Recall that the trigeminal nerve has 3 branches:          Ophthalmic (V1) → to the eye region.      Maxillary (V2) → to the maxilla.      Mandibular (V3) → to the mandible.        Their innervation of the dura mater however, is more complicated.          V1 → antero-medial dura, but also sneaks to the back of the head to innervate most of the cerebellar tentorium.      V2 → over where the maxilla would be.      V3 → near where the foramen ovale is (where the mandibular leaves).      Cervical Spinal Nerves → mainly from C2, C3, innervates the dura over the posterior fossa.      Arterial Supply of the Cranial Cavity  Objective      Describe the intracranial course of the main arteries supplying the brain, name their main branches and state their areas of supply.    There are 4 arteries (2 pairs) that supply the brain itself:          Anteriorly, 2 x Internal Carotid Artery, branching off the common carotids.      Posteriorly, 2 x Vertebral Artery, branching off the subclavians.        As we saw in MSK, the vertebral arteries go through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae, and enter the foramen magnum.  In addition, there is another pair of arteries that enters the skull, but doesn’t enter the brain:          2 x middle meningeal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, which is a branch off the external carotid.      The middle meningeal tracks along the inner surface of the skull, and supplies the meninges with blood.      Note that the middle meningeal runs near the thin pterion! This will be important later on.        Recall from ENT the branches of the external carotid:          Superior Thyroid.      Ascending Pharyngeal.      Lingual.      Facial.      Occipital.      Posterior Auricular.      Maxillary.      Superficial Temporal.        Mnemonic → Some Anatomists Like Freaking Out Poor Medical Students.          Of these, the middle meningeal comes off of the maxillary artery.        Arteries of the Cranial Cavity      4 vessels supply the brain:              2 x Internal Carotid Artery, coming off the common carotids.        2 x Vertebral Artery, coming off the subclavians.              2 other vessels enters the skull, but don’t supply the brain:              2 x Middle Meningeal Artery.            Foramina for the Cranial Vessels  The foramina through which the key vessels of the skull pass through are:          Carotid Canal → Internal Carotid Arteries.      Jugular Foramen → Internal Jugular Veins      Foramen Magnum → Vertebral Arteries.      Foramen Spinosum → Middle Meningeal Arteries.        The foramen spinosum is a tiny hole that’s lateral to the foramen ovale (which was where V3 went through).  What else goes through the jugular foramen?          Recall that the sigmoid sinus enters the jugular foramen, to become the IJV.      In addition to this, we also mentioned that cranial nerves IX, X, XI also go through the jugular foramen.        Correction → the original slide said that the internal carotid goes through the foramen lacerum. This is incorrect; it actually goes through the carotid canal (as mentioned above).          Although the foramen lacerum is close to the carotid canal, nothing actually goes through it, because in living people, it’s actually covered in cartilate.        Foramina for the Cranial Vessels      Carotid Canal → Internal Carotid Arteries.    Jugular Foramen → Internal Jugular Veins    Foramen Magnum → Vertebral Arteries.    Foramen Spinosum → Middle Meningeal Arteries.  The Circle of Willis  Objective      Define the term “Circle of Willis” and state its functional significance.    Circle of Willis → a circle of blood vessels formed between the 4 major arteries that feed the brain.          Slick setup; by having anastamoses between the cerebral arteries, there is collateral circulation if any of the 4 arteries are affected.      Good at compensating for the gradual occlusion of one vessel (eg. plaque accumulation), but insufficient for compensating for sudden changes (eg. a burst aneurysm).      Location → runs around the pituitary stalk and optic chiasm (very small). Above the cavernous sinus.        Anatomy of the Circle of Willis:          Posteriorly, the L &amp; R vertebrals combine to form the basilar artery.      This then splits to form 2 x posterior cerebral arteries.      Anteriorly, the L &amp; R internal carotids give off anterior cerebral arteries.      The posterior cerebral arteries connect to the ICAs via the posterior communicating branches.      The two anterior cerebral arteries connect via a single anterior communicating branch.      After the ICAs give off the anterior cerebrals, they continue as the middle cerebral arteries.        THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIES ARE NOT PART OF THE CIRCLE OF WILLIS.          See the figure; the middle cerebral arteries are not part of the circle itself.        Objective      Outline the distribution of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries to the cerebral cortex.    You can figure out the distribution of the cerebral arteries based on how they exit the Circle of Willis:          The anterior cerebral arteries exit straight out, so they supply the midline.      The middle cerebral arteries exit to the sides, so they supply the lateral brain.      The posterior cerebral arteries reflect backwards, so they supply the posterior and inferior brain.        Note that the middle cerebral arteries are considered the terminal branches of the internal carotid arteries, and the posterior cerebral arteries are the terminal branches of the basilar artery.Cranial Hematomas  Cranial hematomas can be classified into 3 groups, depending on where the blood leakage occurs:          Epidural Hematoma.      Subdural Hematoma.      Subarachnoid Hematoma.        Because the structures in each compartment difer, the causes of each differ as well.1. Epidural Hematoma  Objective      State the origin and intracranial location of the middle meningeal artery and its significance in intracranial hemorrhage.    Epidural Hematoma → blood in the epidural space (between the dura mater and the skull).  Cause → Typically due to a fracture at the pterion, which tears the middle meningeal artery.          Recall that the pterion was the thinnest part of the skull, and that it’s nearby the path of the middle meningeal.      This causes filling of the potential space between the dura and skull.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          The classic presentation is that the person passes out, but then come-to and seem normal (lucid interval).      Gradual compression of the brain then results in coma.      Without relief of the pressure, the central structures of the brain will try and herniate through the foramen magnum.      This compresses the structures that control your breathing, which can lead to respiratory failure.      2. Subdural Hematoma  LESS COMMON THAN A SUBARACHNOID OR EPIDURAL HEMATOMA.  Subdural Hematoma → blood in the subdural space (between the arachnoid and dura mater).  Cause → Sudden acceleration-deceleration of the brain parenchyma.          Results in tearing of the reflections of the meningeal layers of the dura mater.      This can also tear the bridging veins, which transmit blood from the cerebral veins in the subarachnoid space up to the venous sinuses (which lie between the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura).      This results in venous leakage into the subdural space.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          The seepage of blood here is generally slower since it’s of venous origin.      Symptoms may appear weeks after the injury.      3. Subarachnoid Hematoma  Subarachnoid Hematoma → blood in the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater).  Cause → Typically due to a ruptured aneurysm; typically saccular/berry aneuryms (round outpouchings).          Recall that the cerebral vessels and the CSF run in the subarachnoid space.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          “Thunderclap” headache → extremely intense.      Nausea, vomiting, LOC.      Neck stiffness due to increased pressure on the meninges.      Visual changes.        Summary of Hematomas                    Type        Location        Cause        Symptoms                            Epidural        Between skull and dura mater        Fracture of pterion, resulting in tearing of the middle meningeal artery        Brief lucid interval followed by coma                    Subdural        Between dura mater and arachnoid mater        Acceleration-deceleration injury, resulting in tearing of the bridging veins        Often slow progression since venous flow is slower                    Subarachnoid        Between arachnoid mater and pia mater        Ruptured aneurysm, typically of a cerebral artery        Thunderclap headache, severe nausea, vomiting, LOC            Hydrocephalus  Hydrocephalus → ‘water in head’.          Caused by conditions where the CSF that’s produced in the brain can’t escape.      The accumulation of CSF puts pressure on the brain, which can cause serious consequences.      In patients &lt; 2 y/o with hydrocephalus, the sutures haven’t fused yet so the skull can expand to accomodate this growth.      This results in the infants that you see with massive skulls.        Hydrocephalus can be categorized as 2 types:          Non-communicating (aka. Obstructive) → the CSF can’t reach the subarachnoid space.      Communicating (aka. Non-Obstructuve) → the CSF can reach the subarachnoid space, but can’t drain into the venous sinuses via the arachnoid granulations.      Obstructive Hydrocephalus  Also known as non-communicating hydrocephalus.  Here, the CSF made in the ventricles can’t get out into the subarachnoid space.          As a result, the ventricles dilate due to continued CSF production and accumulation.      This pushes the cerebrum against the skull and flattens the gyri.      Non-Obstructive  Also known as communicating hydrocephalus.  Here, although the CSF can reach the subarachnoid space, the arachnoid granulations can’t drain the excess CSF.          This is usually a consequence of a bleed or meningitis, which scars the meninges.      This scarring blocks outflow of CSF via the arachnoid granulations.      Since the CSF can get into the subarachnoid space, but can’t get out, it ends up pushing the brain from the outside.        Intead of pushing the brain OUT from within (obstructive), here you’re pushing the brain IN from outside.          This is conceptually analogous to a subarachnoid hematoma.        Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus:          In some patients, the excess CSF distributes in the subarachnoid space so uniformly that there isn’t a marked rise in the ICP.      This is referred to as a normal pressure hydrocephalus.      In these patients, symptoms can be very non-specific: gait disorder, incontinence, dementia. In other words, it’s almost impossible to differentiate from old age!        Summary of Hydrocephalus                    Type        Cause        Result                            Obstructive (Non-Communicative)        CSF can’t get into subarachnoid space        CSF pushes the brain OUT from within                    Non-obstructive (Communicative)        CSF can get into the subrachnoid space, but can’t drain into the venous sinuses        CSF pushes the brain IN from outside            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/17/anatomy-cranial-cavity-2.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity I", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define the neurocranium and name the bones and sutures contributing to it.  Define the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae and list the main osteological features of each.  Describe the meninges, their specializations (dural folds, venous sinuses, arachnoid granulations), their relationship to one another, and their clinical significance with respect to intracranial hemorrhage.The Neurocranium  Objective      Define the neurocranium and name the bones and sutures contributing to it.    The skull is classically divided into 2 parts:          Neurocranium → the part that holds the brain.      Viscerocranium → the bones of the face.        Calvaria → roof of the neurocranium.  Cranial Base → floor of the neurocranium.Osteology of the Neurocranium  The bones of the neurocranium include:          Frontal Bone → single.      Parietal Bone → paired.      Sphenoid → single bone; located in the middle of the skull.      Temporal Bone → paired.      Occipital Bone → single.        Some features on the inferior aspect of the neurocranium are as follows:  On the temporal bone:    The reason our bones have bumps (tubercles, tuberosities, etc), are due to the attachments of structures, which act to gradually pull on the bone.          External Auditory Meatus → your ‘ear hole’, one on each temporal bone.      Mastoid Process → can be felt as a ‘bump’ behind your ear, formed due to the pulling action of the sternocleidomastoid.      Styloid Process → very pointed, and pronounced. Called ‘styloid’ because it’s shaped like a pen.        On the occipital bone:          Occipital condyles → this is what articulates with the atlas (C1), and allows you to nod.      Foramen magnum → ‘big window’, through which your brain stem and spinal cord exits the cranial cavity.      External occipital protuberance → where some muscles of the neck (eg. trapezius), and the ligamentum nuchae attach.      Sutures of the Neurocranium  Sutures → joints between the flat bones of the neurocranium.          Once they fuse, they don’t move together, but they are still considered joints.        The sutures are as follows:          Sagittal suture → easy to remember; in the sagittal plane, between the two parietal bones.      Coronal suture → separates the frontal bone from the two parietal bones.      Lambdoid suture → shaped like a λ, separates the occipital bone from the two parietal bones.      Frontal/Metopic suture → only present in infants because the frontal bone arises from two parts, which fuse later on. The suture between them is the metopic suture.        The flat bones grow into the sutures without requiring a cartilaginous template.          Recall from ITM (long time ago!) that the flat bones of the head are formed by intramembranous ossification.                  With intramembranous ossification, the bone forms directly from a mesenchymal membrane, without requiring a template.          Contrast this with the long bones in our body (arms, legs), which are formed by endochondral ossification, where a cartilaginous model gets ossified later.                      When you’re an infant, you have soft parts in your skull called fontanelles, which are large membranous openings between the bones of the skull.          These allow the bones to glide over each other during birth, and allow for the skull to fit through the vaginal opening.      Fontanelles disappear within 18 months of birth.        The sutures in infants also remain open to allow for rapid brain growth in the first couple of years.Clinical Application  Craniosynostosis → premature fusion of the cranial sutures.          This results in reduced growth in the region where the sutures fused prematurely.      The most common example is where the sagittal suture fuses prematurely, resulting in a narrow head.      In cases where the metopic suture (between the two pieces of the frontal bone) fuses too early, you can end up with a pointy forehead.        Craniosynostosis will result in abnormal brain development, unless the affected sutures are released (involving surgery).Landmarks of the Skull  These landmarks indicate where sutures of different bones meet.  Examples include:          Bregma → the intersection between the frontal and sagittal suture.      Lambda → the intersection between the lambdoid and sagittal suture.      Pterion → at the blending of the sutures between the temporal bone, parietal bone, and sphenoid bone. Forms an H shape.        Of these 3, the most clinically important landmark is the pterion, because it’s structurally where the skull is the thinnest.The Cranial Fossae  Objective      Define the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae and list the main osteological features of each.    The cranial fossae are depressions in the internal cranial base, and are formed by different parts of the brain.  The cranial fossae are as follows:          Anterior → contains the frontal lobes.      Middle → contains the temporal lobes.      Posterior → contains the cerebellum and brainstem.It was called the sella turcica (the Turkish seat) because of its resemblance to a saddle used by the Turks which had supports in the front and back.        In the centre of the middle cranial fossae is the region where the pituitary is held (recall, the sella turcica).  The height of each of these fossa is in descending order: the anterior fossa is the most shallow, and the posterior fossa is the deepest.          So if you poured water into the anterior cranial fossa, it would cascade down into the middle, and then posterior fossae.        Summary of the Cranial Fossae      There are 3 fossa that comprise the cranial base.                      Fossa        Contains                            Anterior        Frontal Lobes                    Middle        Temporal Lobes                    Posterior        Cerebellum &amp; Brainstem            Anterior Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Frontal Bone (green).      Sphenoid Bone (red).      Ethmoid Bone (yellow).        Frontal Component:          Although the frontal bone forms the front of the skull, it also reflects to form the roof of the orbit and the anterior cranial fossa.        Sphenoid Component:          The part in the anterior fossa is the lesser wing of the sphenoid, which is named relative to the greater wing, which you can see in the middle cranial fossa.      At the tips of the lesser wing of the sphenoid are the anterior clinoid processes (clinoid = bed post). These are also formed by the tugging of the dura.      In combination with the posterior clinoid processes in the middle fossa, these form a ‘4-poster bed’ that surrounds the pituitary.        Ethmoid Component:          The part of the ethmoid bone that forms the anterior cranial fossa is called the cribriform plate, which is named as such because it has many small holes that allow the olfactory nerves to get through to the nose.      Along the midline of the ethmoid is the crista galli (crest of the rooster), which sort of looks like a mohawk.                  The crista galli is formed by the tugging of the dura on the ethmoid.                    Middle Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Sphenoid Bone (red).      Temporal Bone (orange).      Parietal Bone (pink).        Note that the temporal bone has 2 parts:          Squamous → sheet-like; this is what we saw on the outside of the neurocranium.      Petrous → ‘like a rock’; this is the hardest bone in the body! The middle and inner ear are found here.        An important part of the middle cranial fossa is the sella turcica:          This is where the pituitary sits.      There are 3 parts which comprise the sella turcica:                  Hypophyseal fossa → aka. the pituitary fossa; this is the seat.          Tuberculum sellae → this is the anterior wall.          Dorsum sellae → this is posterior wall.                    Off the dorsum sellae are the posterior clinoid processes, which as we mentioned before, form a 4-poster bed along with the anterior clinoid processes.      Posterior Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Temporal Bone (orange).      Parietal Bone (pink).      Occipital Bone (purple).        Key components in the posterior fossa include:          Foramen magnum → where the spinal cord and brain stem exit the cranial cavity.      Clivus → latin for slope; refers to the little slide down into the foramen magnum where the medulla sits.      Internal occipital protuberance.      Internal occipital crest.        As with the crista galli, the internal occipital protuberance and internal occipital crest are formed by the pulling of the dura.The Meninges  Objective      Describe the meninges, their specializations (dural folds, venous sinuses, arachnoid granulations), their relationship to one another, and their clinical significance with respect to intracranial hemorrhage.    The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord, and consist of 3 layers:          Dura mater → ‘tough mother’; the tough outer layer.      Arachnoid mater → beneath the dura; named as such because of the spidery, web-like appearance of its fibres.      Pia mater → ‘tender mother’; referred to as such because it is faithful/clining; it adheres closely to the brain.      Dura Mater  Tough mother.  Comprised of an outer periosteal and inner meningeal layer.  The meningeal layer actually pulls off of the periosteal layer and folds in on itself to produce folds.  There is a potential space between the dura and the skull, and between the dura and arachnoid mater.          Epidural space → between the dura mater and skull.      Subdural space → between the dura and arachnoid mater.        Generally, there is no space in either of these; however, they can get filled as a result of injury (eg. with a epidural or subdural hematoma).  Additionally, wherever the inner meningeal layer reflects to form a fold, there is a gap formed between the outer periosteal and inner meningeal layers.          Within these gaps are venous sinuses; this will be shown later on.      Arachnoid Mater  Spider-like.  Thin, transparent membrane.  Covers the brain, but does not enter the sulci.  Separated from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space.  Unlike the epidural and subdural space, the subarachnoid space is a realized space.          The CSF and cerebral arteries and veins are located in the subarachnoid space.        In addition, there are arachnoid granulations, which are projections that pop through the dura mater and interact with the venous sinuses there.          These function to drain excess CSF, in order to maintain the intracranial pressure.      Pia Mater  Faithful, clinging.  Thin, delicate membrane.  Adherent to the surface of the brain → unlike the arachnoid mater, this goes into the sulci.Meningitis  Meningitis → inflammation of the meninges.          Typically caused by a virus, but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and even some drugs.        Symptoms: headache, fever, drowsiness.  Can lead to: inflammation and sepsis, coma, death.Signs of Meningitis  Kernig’s Sign → straight leg raises causes marked pain/discomfort in the neck.  Brudzinski’s Sign → the opposite; here, you lift up the neck, and the legs involvuntarily lift up.  Nuchal Ridigity → an inability to flex the neck due to rigid muscles.  Lumbar Puncture → take a sample of the LSF.          Taken at the level of L4 (PSIS); recall from MSK that this is done to avoid the spinal cord.        Kernig’s sign and Brudzinski’s sign are highly specific, but not very sensitive; hence they’re good for ruling-in meningitis.  Summary of the Meninges      Meninges cover and help protect the brain    3 layers of meninges:              Outermost layer is dura mater        Middle layer is arachnoid mater        Innermost layer is pia mater              Potential space between dura mater and skull isepidural space    Potential space between dura mater and arachnoidmater is subdural space    Real space between arachnoid mater and pia mater issubarachnoid space               This is where cerebral arteries and veins and CSF run              Meningitis = inflammation of meninges.  Dural Folds  As mentioned previously, the inner meningeal layer of the dura mater separates from the outer periosteal layer to form folds.  These function to separate regions of the brain, and prevent the brain from moving around too much.  The largest and most important fold is the cerebral falx; this is a fold that separates the L and R hemispheres of the brain.          Attaches to frontal crest, crista galli, internal occipital protuberance and the midline of the calvaria.        In addition, there is the cerebellar tentorium.            It’s named as such because it acts as a tent for the cerebellum.      This separates the cerebellum from the cerebrum.      Continuous with the cerebral falx.      There is a ‘tentorial notch’ anteriorly that allows the brainstem to pass through.        Other dural folds include:          Sella Diaphragm → forms a roof over the pituitary, with a small opening for the infundibulum (pituitary stalk). Like a blanket over the pituitary (to go along with the 4-poster bed).      Cerebellar falx → similarly to the cerebral falx, this partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres.        Summary of Dural Folds                    Name        Location                            Cerebral Falx        Between the L and R hemispheres of the cerebral cortex                    Cerebellar Tentorium        Forms a ‘tent’ over the cerebellum                    Sella Diaphragm        Covers the pituitary; small opening for the stalk                    Cerebellar Falx        Partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres            Venous Drainage of the Cranial Cavity  As mentioned before, these form between the outer periosteal and inner meningeal layers of the dura; hence, they’re surrounded by dura mater.          Large veins from the brain empty into sinuses which ultimately drain into the internal jugular veins (IJV).      In addition, the veins also serve to receive CSF from the arachnoid granulations (mentioned previously).        Along the cerebral falx, there are 2 important venous sinuses:          Superior sagittal sinus → along the top fold.      Inferior sagittal sinus → along the bottom fold.        The superior sagittal sinus travels all the way to the back of the head, to the confluence of the sinuses.  The inferior sagittal sinus stops at the anterior border of the cerebellar tentorium, and then connects to the confluence via the straight sinus.  From the confluence of the sinuses, the blood then goes transversely through the transverse sinuses, and then through a s-shaped sigmoid sinus.  Finally, they exit through the jugular foramen.          Aptly, once the sigmoid sinuses leaves the jugular foramen, they’re no longer called sigmoid sinuses, but  instead called internal jugular veins.        The arachnoid granulations are located primarily along the superior sagittal sinus, and also in lateral offshoots called lateral venous lacunae.  As mentioned before, this is where excess CSF leaves the cranial cavity.  Because of the pressure created by these lacunae, you can actually see depressions on the inside of the skull!   Venous Drainage of the Skull      There are 2 main sinuses along the skull; the superior sagittal sinus, and the inferior sagittal sinus.    The superior sagittal sinus drains directly into the confluence; the interior sagittal sinus drains indirectly via the straight sinus.    Once blood reaches the confluence, it travels along the side of the skull via transverse sinuses, and then into an s-shaped vessel called the sigmoid sinus.    The sigmoid sinus passes through the jugular foramen; once it passes this, it’s now known as the internal jugular vein.  The Cavernous Sinus  The cavernous sinus is probably the most clinically important sinus.          Unlike the other venous sinuses, which form tubes, this is more of a plexus.                  As a result, blood in the cavernous sinus is more sluggish, and is more prone to infection.                    In addition, the cavernous sinus is an important area of venous communication; it connects to a number of places outside the cranial cavity, such as the face, jaws, etc.      POTENTIAL ROUTE FOR INFECTION → an infection can start from outside the neurocranium, and get inside via the cavernous sinus!        Clinical Examples:            One example of how an infection can track into the brain is via the facial vein, which communicates with the ophthalmic vein, which then communicates with the cavernous sinus.      As a result, an infection in the danger triangle (shown right), can track into facial vein → ophthalmic vein → cavernous sinus → meningitis.      So if you’re really unlucky, and you have a gruesome pimple there, you could get meningitis!!      Another example is with a tooth infection, which could track to the pterygoid venous plexus → cavernous sinus → infection.      The petrosal sinuses are named as such because they relate to the petrosal portion of the temporal bone.  The cavernous sinus communicates with the rest of the sinuses of the skull via petrosal sinuses.          Superior petrosal → runs along the border of the middle and posterior cranial fossae, and enters the sigmoid sinus.      Inferior petrosal → typically drains into the internal jugular (past the jugular foramen), but sometimes drains into the sigmoid instead.        Importantly, everything leaves through the jugular foramen.  Remember      The cavernous sinus is an important route through which an infection could track into the brain.    It drains via superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, into the sigmoid sinus/IJV.  Relations of the Cavernous Sinus  The cavernous sinus lies around the sella turcica and pituitary; hence it’s near a lot of vulnerable structures.  These include:          Optic tract.  Interestingly, the internal carotid artery actually runs through the cavernous sinus (an artery runs through a vein)! This is the only place in the body where this happens.      Internal carotid artery      Abducens (CN VI) → runs with the ICA.      Oculomotor (CN III)      Trochlear (CN IV)      Ophthalmic (V1 of Trigeminal)      Maxillary (V2 of Trigeminal)        So what could happen with a cavernous sinus infection?          Problems with eye tracking (CN III, IV, VI).      Abnormal sensation in the ophthalmic and maxillary regions (V1 &amp; V2).      If the infection came from the ophthalmic vein, then eye problems may be seen too.        These symptoms are described as Cavernous Sinus Syndrome:          Presentation → think of the surrounding structures:                  Orbital or facial pain, orbital swelling and chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), fever, oculomotor neuropathy, trigeminal neuropathy.                    Causes → anything in or nearby the cavernous sinus.                  Typically from cavernous thrombosis, due to infection.          Also can be caused by carotid aneurysms (ICA runs through cavernous sinus), carotid-cavernous fistulas, meningiomas, or pituitary tumours.                      Cavernous Sinus Syndrome      Caused by anything that causes pressure near the cavernous sinus.    The symptoms that it causes can be deduced from the surrounding anatomy:              Internal Carotid Artery.        Motor Innervation to Eye → CN III, IV, VI.        Sensory Innervation to Upper Face → V1 and V2 of CN V.            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/17/anatomy-cranial-cavity-1.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cerebrum", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Know the names and locations of the major sulci, fissures and the name location and border of the lobes of the cerebral cortex.  Know the names, locations and function of the motor, sensory and association areas of the cerebral cortex.Major Regions of the Brain  Cerebrum = the largest part of the brain, and includes the cerebral cortex.  Parts of the brain include:          Cerebrum.      Diencephalon.      Midbrain.      Pons.      Medulla Oblongata.      Cerebellum &amp; Spinal Cord.        Through our neuroanatomy lectures, we’ll be working from the top down, starting from the cerebrum.The CerebrumOverview of the Cerebrum  The cerebrum is comprised of 3 parts:          Cerebral cortex (aka. gray matter) → comprised of neurons.      Cerebral white matter → comprised of axons; this serves to connect different regions of the cerebral cortex and the subcortical structures.      Deep gray matter → made up of the basal ganglia.        The cerebral cortex is split into 2 hemispheres, the L and R hemisphere.  In humans, we have a gyrencephalic brain (the cortex has folds), while in smaller mammals like rodents, they have a lissencephalic brain (the cortex is smooth).          Another important differentiator is the amount of cerebral white matter; humans have significantly more neural interconnections.        Remember      The cerebrum is comprised of (1) cerebral cortex, (2) cerebral white matter, and (3) deep gray matter.    The cerebral cortex is comprised of neurons; the cerebral white matter is comprised of axonal interconnections.  Overview of the Cerebral Hemispheres  The two cerebral hemispheres is the largest part of the brain; it comprises 83% of the total brain mass.  Different regions have different functions:          Sensory.      Motor.      Multi-modal Association Areas (perception &amp; interpretation).        The surface of the cerebral cortex has grooves and ridges.          Gyri = ridges.      Sulci = grooves.        When a sulcus is particularly deep, it’s instead referred to as a fissure.  Some of these gyri and sulci are consistent between brains, and help provide an anatomical landmark to separate different regions.Lobes of the Cerebrum  The cerebrum has 5 lobes (paired):          Frontal.      Parietal.      Temporal.      Occipital.      Insular (hidden; insulated)        The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by the central sulcus.  The frontal and temporal separated by the lateral (sylvian) fissure.  The occipital and parietal lobes are aptly separated by the parietal occipital sulcus.  The insular lobe is hidden beneath the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.          As shown to the right, if you reflect these apart, then you can see the insular lobe hiding underneath.      This is why the insular lobe is named as such; it’s ‘insulated’ by the other lobes.      Subdivisions of the Major Lobes  On either side of the central sulcus (separating the frontal and parietal lobes), are two gyri:          The precentral gyrus is the primary somatomotor cortex.      The postcentral gyrus is the primary somatosensory cortex.        Hence, the precentral gyrus lies in the frontal lobe; the postcentral gyrus lies in the parietal lobe.  Before the precentral gyrus, and after the postcentral gyrus, there are another two conserved grooves:          Precentral sulcus.      Postcentral sulcus.        This can be seen to the right; there are 3 sulci (precentral, central, and postcentral), and 2 gyri (precentral and postcentral).  This process of subdivision makes it possible to further classify components of each of the lobes (see right).          Although this may seem complicated, the naming is fairly straightforward.      For example, the frontal lobe can be split into a superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus, which are split by a superior and inferior frontal sulcus.      You don’t need to remember these subdivisions.        Brodmann Classification → this was an attempt to classify the areas of the brain based on their cellular composition; 52 distinct areas were identified.Development of the Cerebral Cortex  The cerebral cortex and lateral ventricles developed originally as a c-shaped structure.  More details are described in the IL; you have to do it; it will be tested!  Key Points on the Cerebrum      The cerebrum is composed of:              Cerebral cortex (gray matter) → neurons.        Cerebral white matter → axons.        Deep gray matter → basal ganglia.              Different anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex have different functional roles; functions include:              Sensory.        Motor.        Multi-modal association (perception, interpretation.)              Gryi = ridges, sulci = folds. Deep sulci are known as fissures.    The cerebral cortex and the lateral ventricles formed a c-shape during development.    Key Points on the Cerebral Lobes      The (paired) lobes of the cerebral cortex include:              Frontal Lobe        Parietal Lobe        Temporal Lobe        Occipital Lobe        Insular Lobe              The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by the central sulcus.    The parietal and occipital lobes are separated by the parietal occipital sulcus.    The temporal and frontal/parietal lobes are separated by the lateral (sylvian) fissure.    The insular cortex is buried beneath the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes and can be seen if these lobes are pulled out of the way.    Anterior to the central sulcus is the precentral gyrus, which is the primary motor cortex.    Posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus, which is the primary sensory cortex.    The major lobes can be subdivided based on the prominent sulci that they contain and their location on the lobe (superior, middle or inferior positions on the lobe). Brodmann mapped 47 different regions of the cortex.  Sensory Regions of the Cortex  The sensory regions of the cortex are ALL located behind the central sulcus.  In addition to the postcentral gyrus which we mentioned previously, there are other key sensory regions.  These sensory regions can either be classified as primary, or secondary.          Primary sensory areas are responsible for the reception of sensory information.      Secondary sensory areas are responsible for the processing of sensory information.        For instance, the primary visual cortex is a primary sensory area. It’s responsible for the reception of visual information, but not it’s interpretation (eg. it doesn’t mediate object recognition).  Object recognition is instead mediated by the visual association area, which is a secondary sensory area.Primary Sensory Areas of the Cortex  In addition to the primary somatosensory area (the postcentral gyrus, which we mentioned earlier), there are a few other primary sensory areas of the cortex:          Primary visual cortex → located at the very back of the occipital lobe. This is responsible for the reception of visual information, but not it’s interpretation (eg. it doesn’t mediate object recognition).      Primary auditory cortex → lies on the superior aspect of the temporal lobe, near the primary somatosensory cortex.      Gustatory Cortex → this is responsible for taste, and it lies at the very bottom of the primary somatosensory area.      Visceral Cortex (not shown) → this is where visceral information is fed to. It’s not seen on the diagram because it’s located on the insular cortex.      Secondary Sensory Areas of the Cortex  Information flows from the primary sensory areas (which receive information), to the secondary sensory areas (which make sense of the information).  Secondary sensory regions of the cortex include:          Somatosensory Association Cortex → responsible for interpreting touch, vibration, and proprioception information. Located just behind the primary somatosensory area.      Visual Association Area → responsible for interpreting visual information. Located just in front of the primary visual cortex.      Auditory Association Area → responsible for identifying auditory information, but not speech comprehension.      Wernicke’s Area → the auditory association area feeds into Wernicke’s area, where speech comprehension takes place.                  In 90% of individuals, Wernicke’s area is on the left side.          So what is the corresponding region on the right side being used for? Studies suggest that it’s also somewhat involved in speech, but also plays a big role in understanding emotional context.    Classically, the olfactory cortex is referred to as a ‘primary’ sensory area, but evidence suggests that the olfactory bulb itself has a primary function, and the olfactory cortex plays a larger role in association. See here.                    Olfactory Cortex (not shown) → this isn’t easily seen on the exterior of the cortex; it’s located on a medial bulge on the temporal lobe called the uncus.        Also shown to the right is the calcarine sulcus, which extends into the brain.  This is important because the primary visual cortex runs on either side of the calcarine sulcus.  The part that can be seen on the outside of the cortex is only a small part of the actual visual cortex.Summary of the Sensory Areas of the Cortex  Primary Sensory Regions                    Name        Location        Function                            Primary Somatosensory Area        Postcentral Gyrus        Reception of touch, vibration, proprioception info                    Primary Visual Cortex        Back of the Occipital Lobe        Reception of visual information                    Primary Auditory Cortex        Top of temporal lobe, near primary somatosensory area        Reception of auditory information                    Gustatory Cortex        Bottom of the primary somatosensory area        Reception of taste information                    Visceral Cortex        Insular lobe        Reception of visceral information              Secondary Sensory Regions                    Name        Location        Function                            Somatosensory Association Cortex        Posterior to the postcentral Gyrus        Interpretation of touch, vibration, proprioception info                    Visual Association Area        Anterior to primary visual cortex        Integration of visual information                    Auditory Association Area        Posterior to primary auditory cortex        Interpretation of auditory information, but not speech recognition                    Wernicke’s Area        Deep to auditory association area, generally on the left side (ie. right-brain-dominant people)        Speech interpretation                    Olfactory Cortex        Medial bulge on temporal lobe (uncus)        Interpretation of olfactory information            Motor Regions of the Cortex  The motor regions of the cortex are ALL located in front of the central sulcus.  Motor regions of the cortex include:          Primary Motor Cortex → contains pyramidal cells, which send impulses to spinal cells and and out to muscles in order to produce movement.      Premotor Cortex → as the name suggests, is located anterior to the primary motor cortex.                  Just like how the somatosensory association cortex integrates information from the primary somatosensory area, the premotor cortex helps plan and coordinate more complex movements.                    Broca’s Area → the ventral part of the premotor cortex, which specifically controls movements necessary to speech.                  Broca’s area is dependent on Wernicke’s area. Although Broca’s is needed for speech, Wernicke’s is necessary for you to understand what you want to say.          Hence, in order to have proper speech, you need both Broca’s and Wernicke’s area to be functional.                      Summary of the Motor Areas of the Cortex                    Name        Location        Function                            Primary Motor Cortex        Precentral Gyrus        Contains pyramidal cells which send impulses down to muscles                    Premotor Cortex        Anterior to the primary motor cortex        Helps plan and coordinate complex motor movements                    Broca’s Area        Ventral part of premotor cortex        Control of muscles involved in speech            Sensory &amp; Motor Homunculi  In both the primary somatosensory cortex (the postcentral gyrus), and the primary motor cortex (the precentral gyrus), there are anatomic regions that map to different body parts.          These maps are referred to as homunculi.      For both the sensory and motor homunculi, their orientation is upside down; that is, the region corresponding to the feet is at the top of the brain, and the region corresponding to the head is at the bottom.        The size of each region of these primary cortices relates to the sensitivity or dexterity of the corresponding body part.          On the somatosensory side, it relates to the sensitivity of that part of the body (the digits and lips are more heavily weighted; the trunk is less heavily weighted).      On the motor side, it relates to the dexterity of that part of the body (the face and hand is heavily weighted; the legs are less weighted).        Importantly, the somatosensory and somatomotor control is crossed.          That is, the left somatosensory cortex receives sensory information from the right side of the body, and vice versa.      Similarly, the left motor cortex sends instructions to the &lt;/i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; side of the body.      Multimodal Association Areas  Although the secondary sensory areas of the cortex let you interpret information from different senses, they don’t allow for the integration of this information.  Multimodal association areas resolve this by allowing for the integration of multiple modalities. These include:          PMAA → Posterior Multimodal Association Area.      AMAA → Anterior Multimodal Association Area.      Limbic Region        PMAA (Posterior Multimodal Association Area)          Also known as the general association or Gnostic cortex.      Located on the temporal + parietal lobes.      Since it’s on the posterior cortex (near all the sensory regions), it’s involved in the integration of sensations (tactile, visual, etc).      Gives you an awareness of the spatial location of the body, how to move your body through space, and to make sense of the environment.      This is also where we generate ideas on what we want to do.      Note that the PMAA receives processed information from the secondary sensory areas.        AMAA (Anterior Multimodal Association Area)          Receives information from PMAA, integrates it with past experience, evaluates options, and selects an appropriate response.      Includes your working memory.      Involved in personal and social interactions.      Executive area for task management.        Limbic Region          Responsible for memory and emotion.      Will be saved for a later lecture.      Within cerebral cortex, key region involved is the cingulate gyrus, which is c-shaped and lies right on top of this band of fibres called the corpus callosum, which connects the L &amp; R hemispheres.      Flow of Information Through the CortexFibre Connections of the Cerebrum  The fibre connections of the cerebrum form the white matter; they’re comprised of axon bundles.  Depending on the starting point and the ending point of these fibres, they are given different names.  Generally speaking, there are 3 types of fibres:          Association Fibres.      Commissural Fibres.      Projection Fibres.        Association Fibres are fibres that connect two regions that are in the same hemisphere. They can either be short or long:          Short → an association fibre that starts and ends in the same lobe.      Long → an association fibre that travels between lobes.        Commissural Fibres are fibres that travel between the two hemispheres.          The largest bundle of these is a commisural fibre pathway known as the corpus callosum.      It is the main connection between the left and right hemispheres of the brain.        Projection Fibres are fibres that connect the cerebral cortex to the subcortical structures.          These are the fibres that connect the cortex to the rest of the brain.      Afferent fibres heading to the cortex, and efferent fibres leaving the cortex merge in a large bundle of fibres called the internal capsule, which distributes to the subcortical parts of the brain.      When the internal capsule reaches the cortex, the fibres branch out to connect to different regions; this forms what’s known as the corona radiata.        Summary of White Matter      There are 3 types of fibres in the brain:              Association Fibres → between regions on the same hemisphere of the cortex.                      Short association fibres → between regions on the same lobe, on the same hemisphere.            Long association fibres → between regions on different lobes, on the same hemisphere.                          Commissural Fibres → between regions on different hemispheres.        Projection Fibres → between the cortex and the subcortical regions.            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/anatomy-cerebrum.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Neuroanatomy", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Know and understand the basic functions of the nervous system and the divisions responsible for these functions.  Know the anatomical parts of a neuron, the types of neurons and support cells and compare the types of neurons found in the nervous system.Functional Neuroanatomy  CNS (Central Nervous System) → brain &amp; spinal cord.           Functions as an integration and command centre.        PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) → nerves &amp; ganglia.          Acts as a communication link between the CNS and the end organs.        Divisions of the PNS            Sensory aka. afferent (inward) division      Motor aka. efferent (outward) division      Both the sensory and motor divisions of the PNS can be subdivided into somatic and visceral systems:                  Somatic (innervate areas which interact with the environment).          Visceral (innervate areas within your body); also called autonomic.                    The visceral (autonomic) motor system can be further divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.        Somatosensory innervation includes touch sense, vibration sense, and proprioception.Example  Below is an example of how the brain elicits visceral motor changes, namely cardiovascular change in response to mental stress.  In the population, there are 2 different populations of people, that react to stress differently:          Cardiovascular reactors to mental stress      Cardiovascular non-reactors to mental stress.        A study done here in London, exposed these two groups to stress (eg. mental math).          Some students had a significant increase in HR; others did not.        What regions of the brain mediates the differences in this response?          DLPFC (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex) and INS (insular cortex) activity was seen in non-reactors, none was seen in reactors.        Summary of Functional Neuroanatomy      The nervous system is responsible for many many simple andcomplex functions    The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinalcord and is an integration and command center.    The PNS the Peripheral is made up of nerves and ganglia and primarily a communication link.    The four major divisions of the peripheral nervous system are:              Somatosensory → afferent information from the environment.        Somatomotor → efferent commands out to skeletal muscles.        Visceral sensory → afferent information from organs and blood vessels.        Visceral motor → efferent output to the organs and blood vessels).              Visceral NS = autonomic NS.    Regions in the CNS are also responsible for these four components, while others are more involved in integrating responses  Anatomy of the Neuron  Dendrite → where impulses are received.  Axons → where impulses are sent through.  Cell Body.  Nucleus.  Myelin Sheath → insulates the neuron to increase conduction speed.Types of Neurons  Neurons are defined as unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar.  The distinction is based on the number of cellular projection from the cell body.   Unipolar neurons only have 1 projection, bipolar neurons have 2, and multipolar ones have multiple projections.          Multipolar Neuron                  99% of neurons.          Consists of many dendrites, and one long axon; hence there are multiple projections coming from the cell body.          Include motor neurons and interneurons (which mediate reflex arcs).                     Unipolar Neurons                  Sensory neurons.          Here, the cell body is connected to the peripheral processes by a single branch, so it is ‘unipolar’ (see below).          In the body, these cell bodies actually bunch together; this is what forms ganglia!                     Bipolar Neurons                  Seen with special sensory organs (such as the eyes).          Bipolar neurons are mainly located in the retina of the eye.                       Summary of Neuron Types                    Type        Characteristic        Examples                            Multipolar        Multiple projections from cell body        Motor neurons, interneurons                    Unipolar        One projection from cell body        Sensory neurons                    Bipolar        Two projections from cell body        Special sensory organs            Myelination of Neurons  Myelination allows for more rapid conduction of nerve impulses, by allowing the impulses to jump between interruptions in the sheath (Nodes of Ranvier).  This jumping is known as saltatory conduction.  Schwann cells create the myelin sheath in the PNS.  Oligodendrocytes create the myelin sheath in the CNS.  Not all nerves are myelinated ones; in cases where fast conduction isn’t required (eg. some visceral nerves), nerves aren’t myelinated.  Remember      Schwann cells create the myelin sheath in the PNS.    Oligodendrocytes create the myelin sheath in the CNS.    Neurons are fragile; they also need support cells.          These cells are known as astrocytes; they have a number of functions, including the buffering of glutamate and calcium.      The also form a neurovascular unit by communicating with the vasculature; this is the medium through which neurons are supplied.      Nomenclature of Neuronal Groupings  The naming of collections of neurons (or cell bodies) differs depending on whether you’re dealing with the CNS or PNS.          In the PNS, a collection of cell bodies is called a ganglia; in the CNS, a collection of cell bodies is called a nucleus.      In the PNS, a collection of neurons is called a nerve; in the CNS, there are many possible terms, including tract, fasciculus, column, funiculus, and lemniscus.        There is one notable exception; there is a large collection of neuronal cell bodies in the CNS called the basal ganglia, and not the basal nucleus.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/intro-neuroanatomy.html"},

Tips for this Course  A huge amount of information is covered in a very small time period.  Don’t skip the IL’s → they ARE on the exams (recall MSK…).  Learn your neuroanatomy well.  Prepare in advance.  Consider completing the practice quizzes and look at the additional resources.          There are 2 other sets of practice questions in the additional resources.        MSK &amp; Neuro integration problems are new this year.          Aim to integrate neuro and MSK issues and make things more integrative.        PCCIA: New topic; Social accountability.          New topic → Social Accountability.      Group Project → Development of a hospital policy on Physician Assisted Death.      Example Questions  What is pyramidal distribution weakness?          Here, leg flexor weakness &gt; leg extensor weakness.      If you have a brain/spinal cord problem (pyramidal aka Upper Motor Neurone weakness), you end up with this.                  In the arms, the flexors are stronger than the extensors, so the arms are bent.          In the legs, the extensors are stronger than the flexors, so the legs can’t bend well.                      What is the DDx for acute onset of aphasia (difficulty producing +/- understanding speech)?          Ischemic stroke.      Hemorrhagic stroke (intracranial hemorrhage).      Migraine aura.  When patients have a seizure in the part of the brain involving speech, then that part may be so exhausted that it can’t function normally.      Seizures (post ictal Todd’s deficit, will see later).      Psychogenic (intentionally/unintentionally ‘faking’ symptoms).                  Intentionally → Malingering.          Unintentionally → Conversion disorder.                    Suggested Resources  Cecil’s Essentials of Medicine → Very good resource.  Blumenfeld’s “Neuroanatomy through Clinical cases”          Chapter 2 is a good exam review.      Expensive (~ $100).      Useful Terms  Plegia → paralysis; essentially no voluntary movement.  Paresis → weakness.  Ataxia → difficulties with motor coordination.  Dominant hemisphere:          The hemisphere where language is housed (not necessarily )      Typically the left hemisphere in right handers.      With left handers, half of people will have a dominant right hemisphere, and the other half will have a dominant left (just like righties).        MCA → middle cerebral artery.          Common place for a stroke to occur.      An MCA stroke causes face and arm &gt; leg contralateral weakness, due to the arrangement of the neural homunculus.        Homunculus → a spatial mapping of the parts of the brain which control different parts of the brain.          The man in the motor cortex is ‘standing on its head’ (ie, the legs are controlled by the top of the brain, then the arms, then the face).      Motor Homunculus → areas which require finer detail have a larger neural representation (eg. face, hands); areas which require less (eg. feet) have a smaller representation.      Sensory Homunculus → different from the motor homunculus; sensitive regions like the lips and fingers are more heavily represented.        Different regions of the homunculus supplies different regions of the homunculus.                  ACA supplies the leg component.          MCA supplies the hand and face.          PCA supplies the eyes.                    ACA = Anterior Cerebral Artery.       MCA = Middle Cerebral Artery.      PCA = Posterior Cerebral Artery.      These 3 arteries come out from the Circle of Willis (which we’ll see later).      Imaging Axes  Just like what we saw with MSK:          Sagittal.      Axial (transverse).      Coronal (frontal).      General Approach to Neurological Problems  What is the problem? → History and P/E.  Where is the lesion? → localization.  What is the DDx?          Using key points on the history and the localization      What is the most likely diagnosis?      What should I not miss (treatable Dx, serious Dx)?        What investigations should be ordered?  Are treatments possible?Case Example  Case Summary      A 24 year old woman was physically fit and very healthy. One evening, she notices some tingling in both feet. Assuming she’s just over tired, she heads to bed. The next morning she stumbles after getting out of bed, and finds her legs feel very weak. She makes an appointment to see her GP the next day.    The next day, she cannot walk independently and needs to have support from her friend to walk. Her arms now feel weak and she has difficulty getting dressed.    In the GPs office, she has bilateral and relatively symmetrical weakness in her arms and legs. Her reflexes are absent. Her sensory examination is normal.    Key points:          Bilateral, symmetric weakness.      Reflexes are absent.      Sensory findings → tingling.      Sensory exam is normal.        What is the problem?          Subacute onset of progressive generalized weakness associated with areflexia and normal sensory exam, despite mild sensory symptoms.        Where is the lesion?          Not the brain nor the brain, recall that you would expect hyper-reflexia.      Hence this is a lower motor neuron problem, but probably isn’t due to a problem with the muscle, or neuromuscular junction, since there are sensory symptoms (tingling) as well.      Hence this is probably a peripheral nerve problem.        What is the DDx?          Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) until proven otherwise.        What shouldn’t you miss? (treatable, serious)          Acute spinal cord pathology (can cause shock and lead to paradoxical short term hyporeflexia).      Myasthenia gravis, inflammatory mypopathy, botulism, tick paralysis, etc.        What investigations should be ordered?          Nerve conduction study.      Lumbar puncture (LP).                  With GBS, will see albuminocytologic dissociation, which is pathognomonic.          This is an elevation in the CSF proteins, without an elevation in the WBCs (hence a ‘dissociation’).                      Are treatments possible?          IVIG → shortens the duration of symptoms, and gets them better faster.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/intro-neuroscience-eye-ear.html"},
