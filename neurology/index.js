Things to Study for Final Exam      Hearing and vertigo.    Red eye DDx.    Extraocular movements.    Localization of visual field deficits.    Triptans in migraine (don’t worry about the drug interactions with triptans)    CSF findings in CNS infections.    Autonomic nervous system IL.    MS.    Cranial trauma.    Genetics Lecture.  Review of Key TopicsSensory Nerve Classifications  Large sensory fibers (carried proximally in dorsal columns):          Proprioception, vibration, golgi tendon (for reflexes)      Always myelinated      6-20µm in diameter      Make up majority of sensory electrical potential during nerve conduction studies.        Small sensory fibers (carried proximally in spinothalamic tract):          Pain and temperature.      Some fibers myelinated and some unmyelinated.      0.2-5µm in diameter.      Are too small to significantly contribute to sensory electrical potentials in NCS (ie SNAPs are normal in small fiber neuropathies).        Sensory Nerve Classifications      Large sensory fibres = dorsal column fibres (proprioception, vibration, reflexes).    Small sensory fibres = spinothalamic fibres (pain, temperature).     Clinical Correlation:          A large fibre sensory neuropathy would result in impaired vibration, proprioception, and reflexes. Numbness is also common.      A small fibre sensory neuropathy would result in altered pin prick and temperature sensation, with maintained reflexes. Dysesthesias are also common.      Headaches  If a headache is infrequent and is happening once every few weeks, it’s more likely to be benign.  If a headache is progressive, it’s much more concerning, and is more likely to be secondary to something.  RED FLAG → raised ICP headaches often present in the first few minutes to an hour of awakening and then improve.Ischemic Stroke Management  Hyperacute ischemic stroke management:          CT head to r/o bleed.      If no bleed, CTA to look for a clot in proximal cerebral artery (ICA/MCA/Basilar).      If no tPA contraindications, give tPA.      Consider clot retrieval.      If tPA is contraindicated and clot retrieval is not an option:                  Allow for increases in BP for up to 48 hours to help perfuse the penumbral tissue and preserve brain tissue (up to around 210/120 ish).                      Secondary stroke investigations are also ordered for all stroke patients.  Intensive rehabilitation occurs during admission; studies show that rehab improves outcomes more than most medical therapies.Other Clinical Pearls  Multiple Sclerosis:          Multifocal central nervous system demyelination      Diagnosis requires both dissemination in time and space for lesions.                  In other words, you need historical or MRI evidence of new lesions developing in different locations (space) at different points in time                      CNS infections:          HSV encephalitis                  Confusion, seizures, fever.          Treated with IV acyclovir.                    Bacterial meningitis                  Treated with 3rd generation cephalosporin, vancomyin (for pen resistent strep pneumo) and dexamethasone                      Clinical presentations of vascular territories for stroke:          Dominant MCA → language, face and arm weakness.      Non Dominant MCA → neglect syndromes.      ACA → leg weakness.      PCA → homonymous hemianopsia or other visual deficit.      Case #1  Case Summary      A 74 year old woman comes in complaining of balance difficulties. She has been stumbling while walking and has fallen a couple of times.    History:              Progressive balance difficulties over 3 weeks.         No vertigo.        No EtOH or chemotherapy exposure. EtOH affects the cerebellum, chemo can affect peripheral nerves (eg. Vincristine)        Dexterity feels reduced, dropping things.        Legs feel mildly weak        Increasing urinary urgency for the last week.         Sensation in legs feels “Off”        No pain.              Physical Exam              CN normal.        Power:                      No pronator drift.            Only weakness is HF 4+ bilaterally.                          Reflexes:                      UE reflexes 2.            LE reflexes 3s and plantars upgoing.            Increased tone in legs.                          Sensation:                      Absent vibration at toes and mid foot. Appreciated at medial malleolus.            Position sensation impaired at distal toe. Pin prick is unremarkable.                          Gait → wide based and unsteady. Cannot tandem.              What is the localization?          Increased tone, Babinsky, and hyperreflexia in LE suggests an UMN problem.      HF weakness reflects mild pyramidal weakness.      Since it affects the LE only, with no UE involvement, this suggests a spinal cord problem.      Reduction in vibration and proprioception sense suggests a dorsal column problem. This causes her impaired balance.        What investigations should be done?          Recall it CANNOT be the lumbar spinal cord if there are UMN findings, because the spinal cord ends at L1/L2.      Hence you would look at the cervical and thoracic spine.      The best imaging modality to use would be an MRI (because it better visualizes soft tissue).        This is the classic presentation for a cervical spondylotic myelopathy (compression of the cord due to vertebral degeneration).Case #2  Case Summary      38 year old woman presents to the ER after having an episode of loss of consciousness. She started to feel unwell in the shower and tried to get out of the shower. Her next awareness was waking up on the floor of the shower.    She suffers a laceration on the back of her head during the fall and there is a small pool of blood on the bathroom floor.    She calls her husband, who drives her to the ER.    On arrival to the ER, she is awake and alert and the occipital laceration has stopped bleeding spontaneously. Vitals are normal and neurological examination is entirely normal.    What is your DDx of an acute transient LOC?:          Syncope → insufficient cerebral perfusion due to:                  Cardiac causes → arrhythmia, cardiac outflow obstruction.          Hypotension → vasovagal episode, other cause of hypotension.                    Seizure      Psychogenic event (pseudoseizure).      Narcolepsy (sleep disorder, uncommon)      Brainstem TIA (affecting RAS, extremely rare).      Transient increased ICP (hydrocephalus, extremely rare).        Additional Information      On further questioning, she reports that she has had 3 other episodes of loss of consciousness. Each episode has been proceeded by feeling lightheaded, all have occurred while standing, and loss of consciousness has been less than 30 seconds without obvious confusion afterwards.    What is the most likely diagnosis and why?  Post-ictal refers to the altered state of consciousness seen after an epileptic seizure.          Without looking at the additional information, the two most likely diagnoses are syncope and a seizure.      Given that there are no post-ictal findings, the LOC was preceded by lightheadedness, and the LOC is orthostatic, suggests that this is due to syncope.        What investigations should be done?          Should determine if this is a cardiac vs. hypotensive cause.      Cardiac investigations should be done (holter, echo).      Wouldn’t be wrong to order an EEG as well to help r/o seizure.      No role for intracranial imaging.      Basics of Seizure Classification  Simple → awareness is retained.  Complex → awareness is affected (they don’t remember the episode).  Focal → seizure is in a specific area.  Primary Generalized → seizure is diffusely over the brain.  Secondary Generalized → seizure started off focal, but then spread to become generalized.Approach to a Patient with Seizures  Thorough history of the event:          Was there an aura preceding the seizure.      Was the event witnessed? If so, what was the first abnormality seen?                  Eye deviation.          Arm posturing.          Bilateral and symmetrical?                    These first abnormalities help determine whether it’s a focal or generalized seizure. A focal seizure requires imaging to rule out an anatomic cause.      Was there a focal post-ictal deficit (Todd’s paresis, confusion, somnolence)?      Is there a history of previous seizures.      Was there an obvious trigger? (trauma, new medications, infection, sleep deprivation, EtOH, recreational drug use).        Decide if event was a seizure vs. other cause for LOC:          As mentioned above, could also be syncope (cardiac cause or hypotensive cause), sleep disorder, or psychogenic (pseudoseizure).        Decide if the seizure is focal or generalized:          An EEG can help distinguish the two.      If it’s focal, then it definitely requires intracranial imaging, as mentioned above      If it’s primary generalized, then it doesn’t require imaging.        Decide if treatment is required for the seizure:          First seizure, or provoked seizure (eg. EtOH withdrawal) → usually not treated.      Recurrent seizure → treatment likely required.        Decide on the treatment:          Depends on the type of seizure (focal vs generalized).      Depends on age and gender of patient (females of childbearing age should avoid teratogenic meds like valproic acid or carbamazepine).      Depends on cost of medications.      Depends on comorbidities.        Determine goals of therapy:          Monotherapy is best                  Attempt to increase dose of a single drug until seizures are well controlled.          If the seizures still recur, switch to another drug before considering dual anticonvulsants.                    Choose the medication with the fewest side effects (duh).      Case #3  Case Summary      In a family physician’s office a 64 year old man complains that he has had 3 episodes of left arm weakness over the last week. The symptoms have lasted 10-15 minutes in duration. His wife witnessed one of the episodes and saw that his left corner of his mouth appeared lower during the episode.     PHx: Smokes 1⁄2 pack a day. Otherwise healthy.    On no medications.    What can cause transient neurological symptoms?          TIA.      Seizures.      Migraines.        In this case, TIA is most likely (no signs of seizure or migraines).  What should your examination include if TIA is the main consideration?          Vitals:                  BP → modifiable stroke risk factor.           HR → atrial fibrillation is a risk factor.          Temperature → could suggest an infectious cause like endocarditis.                    Cardiac/Vascular Exam.      Neurological Exam.        Additional Information      HR 60 and regular, BP 168/90, afebrile    HS normal, no carotid bruits, no stigmata of endocarditis     Neurological exam entirely normal    What should you do next?          Cresecendo TIAs (frequent TIAs) are a large risk factor for subsequent stroke.      TIA clinic referral, especially since he has had 3 previous episodes.      Since he’s hypertensive, needs BP meds and antiplatelet medications.      Further investigations also done (vessel imaging, echo, holter, etc).        If this patient had a single TIA (not multiple), what would you do?          Start ASA 81 mg.      Start antihypertensive Rx       Advise to quit smoking      Referral to TIA clinic      Advise patient to call 911 if stroke symptoms recur.      Case #4  Case Summary      A 45 year old woman presents to her family MD with a headache.    Reports this is the “worst headache of my life”. Headache constant and won’t disappear. She is also complaining of new tinnitus.  Headache Red Flags  Should also add symptoms of raised ICP to the list of red flags:          Headache which awakens you at night.      Headache which is worse in the morning.      Headache associated with nausea/vomiting in the morning.      Worsening headache when supine.        Also recall the danger signs of secondary headaches (SNOOPS)          S → Systemic Symptoms (fever, weight loss).      N → Neurologic Symptoms (confusion, impaired alertness or consciousness).      O → Onset (sudden, abrupt, or gradual).      O → Older (&gt; 50 with new onset and progressive headache).      P → Previous Headache History (first headache, or atypical headache from what you typically experience).      S → Secondary Risk Factors (HIV, systemic cancer).        What are headaches associated with raised ICP worse in the morning?          Cerebral venous drainage is less when supine      Typical breathing during sleep is associated with a slight rise in our pCO2 levels, and elevated pCO2 acts as a vasodilator.        Additional Information      Her headache was of gradual onset and has worsened over the last 3 days. Headache is bilateral and holocephalic.    Headache is worse when upright and improves with lying down.    Valsalva worsens headache.    Headache improves within 3 minutes of lying supine.    This is less suggestive of raised ICP since the headache is worse when upright, and improves when lying down.  What red flags are present, if any?          Valsalva worsens headache.      There’s a worsening pattern of headache.      Tinnitus (focal neurologic signs, other than visual or sensory aura).      Positional component to headache.        This was a case of intracranial hypotension.Intracranial Hypotension  Headaches classically worsen when standing, and improve when supine, the opposite finding as with a raised ICP.  Caused by a CSF leak:          Iatrogenic causes → LP, lumbar surgery, intracranial surgery.      Spontaneous causes → spontaneous dural rupture.        Management of Intracranial Hypotension:          Keep the patient supine (duh).      If thought to be iatrogenic due to an LP, attempt to patch the lumbar region, using a blood patch (which uses autologous blood to block the hole).      If no obvious source for the CSF leak, could do an MRI or nuclear labelled CSF study to identify the source.      Case #5  Case Summary      48 year old farmer starts noticing that he is getting more fatigued with his regular daily work.    The next week, he finds it difficult to get in and out of his tractor.    The following week, he starts noticing that he is having difficulty climbing stairs    Previously healthy and is on no medications.    History:              Weakness seems symmetrical, weakness worse at end of the day.        No CN symptoms (diplopia/dysphagia/dysarthria/ptosis).        No sensory symptoms.        Not painful.        No bladder/bowel symptoms.              Physical Exam:              CN → normal        Power Exam:                      Muscle bulk is normal            Neck Flexion 4+, Neck Extension 5.            Deltoids 4+/4+            HF 4+/4+            Remainder of power full.            Has difficulty getting out of chair without using his arms.                          Reflexes → 2s and symmetric throughout         Sensation → normal        Coordination → normal including gait.              What is the localization?          From Hx alone:                  Since there are no sensory findings, it’s less likely to be a nerve root, plexus, or peripheral nerve cause as well.          Since it’s bilateral, it’s less likely to be the brain.                    With findings from P/E:                  Normal reflexes makes this less likely to be UMN (not spinal cord).          Weakness of neck flexion, deltoids, and hip flexion fits best with a muscle localization (proximal muscle weakness).          Since there’s no ocular involvement, it seems less likely to be a NMJ cause.          Since we don’t see both UMN and LMN signs, this is less suggestive of ALS (AHC).                    Case #6  Case Summary      54 year old woman complains of tremor.    DDx of a Tremor:          Essential tremor.      Parkinsonism.      Exaggerated physiological tremor.      Drug induced.      Weakness associated.        Key questions on history:          Is the tremor worse at rest or with action?                  Rest tremor is PD          Action tremor is ET, physiological, weakness assoc.                    Duration of the tremor?                  ET is longstanding and slowly progressive .          Other tremors are of subacute onset.                    Any improvement with alcohol?                  ET typically improves                    What drugs is the person on?       Any parkinsonism symptoms?                  Stiffness, slowness of movement, gait change, micrographia, constipation, difficulty turning over in bed.                      Key findings on Physical Exam:          Resting/action tremor.      TRAP (acronym for Parkinsonism):                  T → Tremor (resting).          R → Ridigity.          A → Akinesia (loss of facial expression, difficulty getting out of chair, bradykinesia).          P → Postural instability.                    Other neurological findings (weakness/cerebellar signs, etc).        Parkinson’s Disease ≠ Parkinson’s!:          Note parkinsonism refers to parkinsonian exam findings (TRAP) but doesn’t infer etiology      Parkinsonism can also be due to:                  Drug induced parkinsonism          Vascular parkinsonism (stroke induced)          Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)          Other parkinson plus syndromes                      Additional Information      Tremor had only been present for the last 4 weeks and had developed after starting prednisone.    Tremor was only with action and not with rest.    Denied any parkinsonian symptoms    Exam: mild distal postural and action tremor              No rest tremor        No rigidity, bradykinesia, akinesia, postural instability              Dx: drug induced tremor.

	{"title": "Non Mendelian &amp; Mitochondrial Inheritance", "text": "  Lecture Notes      See Non Mendelian &amp; Mitochondrial Inheritance.  Lecture Overview  Part 1 → Genomic imprinting.  Part 2 → Mitochondrial inheritance.Genomic ImprintingLecture Objectives  Describe the underlying genetic mechanisms of non-Mendelian inheritance including uniparental disomy, epigenetics and genomic imprinting.  Explain how altered epigenetic mechanisms contribute to disease phenotypes.  The two children on the right have the same 15q deletion:          On the L the child has Prader-Willi Syndrome.      On the R the child has Angelman Syndrome.        Then why do they have a different presentation?          Genomic Imprinting → some genes are expressed differently depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or father.      This is called parent-of-origin effects.        Mechanism of genomic imprinting:          Modifications to the histones surrounding the DNA affect how exposed it is to transcription (undergrad!)      Histone acetylation increases gene expression by reducing the positive charge of the histone, thus making it less ‘sticky’ to the negatively charged DNA.      Histone methylation reduces gene expression.      In the case of genomic imprinting, the imprint is maintained by methylation, which decreases expression.        How does this apply to this case?            The genes associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome and Angelman syndrome are distinct, but are located in the same region of chromosome 15 (see right). Deletions in this area generally affect both the PWS gene and the AS gene.      The 15q region where these 2 genes are located is an area that is imprinted.      This imprinting happens to be different for the PWS gene and the AS gene.                  The PWS gene is only expressed from chromosome 15 inherited from the father. (PWS is silenced in the mother).          The AS gene is only expressed from chromosome 15 inherited from the mother. (AS is silenced in the father)                    In other words, although you have 2 copies of the PWS and AS genes, you’re ONLY EXPRESSING ONE OF THEM.                  You only express your paternal PWS gene.          You only express your maternal AS gene.          Mnemonic: Prader sounds like ‘father’ for PWS, your mom is an ‘angel’ for Angelman syndrome (cheesy, I know).                    Hence, this is a non-mendelian form of inheritance.        Causes of PWS or Angelman Syndrome:          Chromosomal deletion involving 15q11-13.      Uniparental disomy 15.      Methylation (imprinting) error.      1. Chromosomal Deletion of 15q11-13  Usually this is a de novo deletion, so the parental chromosomes are normal (hence, this isn’t inherited).          Prader-Willi Syndrome will be caused by a PATERNAL deletion.      Angelman Syndrome will be caused by a MATERNAL deletion.        As before, this is because we only express our paternal PWS gene, and we only express our maternal AS gene.2. Uniparental Disomy 15  In some children with PWS or Angelman syndrome, there is no deletion.  In this case, what happened was uniparental disomy:          Prader-Willi Syndrome will be caused by receiving both 15 chromosomes from the mother, since both will be silenced.      Angelman Syndrome will be caused by receiving both 15 chromosomes from the father, since both will be silenced.        Can be detected via methylation studies.  IMPORTANT CONCEPT → here, the genes themselves are perfectly normal; there’s just a problem with expression.  How does uniparental disomy occur?          Trisomy Rescue.      Monosomy Rescue.      Trisomy Rescue  Here, an abnormal disomic gamete and a normal gamete combine to form a trisomy conception.          With PWS or Angelman, the disomic gamete has 2 chromosome 15s, but only one copy of all the other chromosomes.        Trisomy 15 is normally lethal, resulting in loss of the conception.          However, if, during cell division, one of the cells loses the extra chromosome 15, then you can actually have a phenomenon called trisomy rescue, which makes the conception viable.      However, if the chromosome from the normal gamete is removed, you will end up with 2 copies from the same parent.      Since this is a random process, trisomy rescue could also result in loss of the duplicated chromosome, resulting in a normal phenotype.          Can uniparental disomy happen with Trisomy 21?          Yes, but it wouldn’t result in a phenotype since chromosome 21 isn’t imprinted.      Hence, it wouldn’t matter if the copies came from your mother or your father, since neither are silenced.      Also, while trisomy 21 is possible since it’s viable, trisomy 15 is not (since it’s lethal).      Monosomy Rescue  This is the opposite as with a trisomy rescue.  Here, due to a nondisjunction error, one gamete ends up missing a chromosome 15.  When this gamete combines with the other, it produces a monosomy conception.  Monosomy 15 is also lethal:          However, the conception could be saved if the chromosome somehow duplicates itself (it happens).      This results in the same endpoint as with a trisomy rescue.        Monosomy rescue can lead to expression of an autosomal recessive disorder even if there was only one parental copy:  As a sidenote, if it was the other way around, and the mother was a carrier, you would suspect non-paternity first and foremost (which is embarrassingly surprisingly common). But since the mother has no copies of the mutation, this is impossible in this case.          EXAMPLE: A baby boy is diagnosed as having PKU      Testing shows that he is homozygous for a mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.      His father is a carrier of the mutation but his mother is not.      3. Imprinting Error  In rare cases of AS or PWS, the child ends up with a defect in the imprinting centre (eg. a defect with the histone methyltranferases).          Results in failure of setting the appropriate imprint in gametogenesis.      This must be recessive, since you need two non-functioning enzymes to result in a failure of imprinting.        Only certain chromosomes are imprinted:          See right. Although you don’t need to memorize this, note that chromosome 14 and 15 in particular are imprinted.        When does imprinting occur?          Genomic imprinting occurs at the time of gametogenesis.      The imprint is reversible and reset at gametogenesis, according to the sex of the parent.      In early gametogenesis, any epigenetic changes to the parental chromosomes are wiped.      During gametogenesis, the imprinting is ‘reset’, and new epigenetic changes are added.      As a result of the above, even the maternal chromosome on your fathers side will have a paternal imprint in the gamete, and vice versa.      Net result: fertilzation results in a female or male zygote with one maternal and one paternal imprint.      Should say significance of EPIGENETIC disorders vs imprinting disorders (epigenetic is broader).Mitochondrial Inheritance", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/04/22/non-mendelian-mitochondrial-inheritance.html"},
	{"title": "Clinical Neurology Small Group III", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary  A 37 year old woman presents to the urgent neurology clinic with a referral question of “foot drop”. Two weeks ago, she noticed on awakening that she was dragging her right leg when walking and she had come close to falling on a couple of occasions. She has felt a tight sensation around her right flank around the same time. The symptoms came on overnight and have not worsened nor improved over time. She has noticed some urinary frequency and urgency since the leg symptoms began.  Two years ago, she had an episode of monocular vision loss in her left eye which lasted 3 weeks. She was seen by an ophthalmologist at that time who diagnosed her with optic neuritis. Her vision improved and she had not had a recurrence.  Past Medical History: otherwise healthy. Meds: none. Family Hx: non-contributory. Systemic review of symptoms was unremarkable.  On examination, she was noted to have a mildly pale left optic disc on fundoscopy. Cranial nerves were otherwise normal with no evidence of a RAPD. Upper extremity power was full. Left leg power was full. On the right side, her hip flexion was 4+, knee extension 5, knee flexion 4+, ankle dorsiflexion 4, ankle plantar flexion 5, foot inversion 5, and foot eversion 4. Upper extremity reflexes were 2s throughout. Patellar reflexes were 3 on the right and 2 on the left. Ankle reflexes were 4 on the right and 2 on the left. Plantar response was extensor on the right and flexor on the left. Pin prick was slightly reduced over the left leg, with a sensory level of approximately T8. Upper extremity coordination testing was unremarkable. Lower extremity coordination testing revealed difficulties related to the weakness, but there was no obvious superimposed ataxia.Questions  Localize her most recent symptoms of leg weakness.          Possible localizations include:                  Upper motor neuron → brain, brainstem, spinal cord.          Lower motor neuron → AHC, root, plexus, peripheral nerve, NMJ, muscle.                    Patient has pyramidal weakness (extensors &gt; flexors in leg) on the R side.      Also has hyperreflexia and a positive Babinsky on the R side.      The above suggest an UMN problem (brain, brainstem, or spinal cord).      Although the urinary frequency and urgency might be suggestive of cauda equina, cauda equina is a LMN finding, which isn’t compatible with the above UMN signs.      Reduction in pinprick sensation over the contralateral leg suggests that this a spinal cord issue, since the spinothalamic tract crosses right when it enters the spinal cord.      Hence, with the above, this is a R spinal cord problem, most likely at T8 given the sensory level.        What is the most likely clinical diagnosis? Are other diagnoses possible? How would you confirm this diagnosis?          Multiple Sclerosis is most likely, since she seems to have had multiple focal CNS lesions over time and space.                  Optic nerve lesion 2 years ago.          R thoracic spinal cord lesion now.                    Confirmation → Imaging (MRI brain + spinal cord).      Optic neuritis at a young age is suspicious for MS (recall that CN II is part of the CNS, and not PNS).        What is the underlying pathophysiology of MS? How can this be directly related to the symptoms with which the disease presents?          Caused by a T-cell mediated inflammatory process that results in demyelination.      Focal regions of demyelination, followed by recovery, results in the multiple focal lesions.      Axon damage due to these inflammatory effects results in progression long-term.        Discuss the clinical relevance of:          LHermitte’s sign → neck flexion causes an ‘electrical sensation’ that goes down the back.                   This causes pulling along the dorsal column or caudal medulla.          With a demyelinating lesion, it’s thought that electrical communication is disrupted, resulting in abnormal electrical signalling.          Not specific to MS; any obstruction of the dorsal column or problem with myelination can cause it.                    Uhthoff’s sign → exacerbation of neurological findings due to hot weather, fever, or exercise.                  Seen in MS, it’s thought that this is due to an exacerbation of already impaired nerve conduction with an increase in heat.                    Relative afferent pupillary defect → an impairment in the afferent signal from one eye relative to the other.                  Assessed by the Swinging flashlight test, where you would see paradoxical dilation with direct light (since the eye ‘sees’ less light via the direct reflex compared to via the consensual reflex).          Could be suggestive of optic neuritis, which could corroborate a diagnosis of MS.                      What are the diagnostic criteria for MS? Can MS be diagnosed clinically or is imaging necessary?          MS is a diagnosis of exclusion.      Any corroborative symptoms must last for more than 24 hours.      MS can theoretically be diagnosed clinically, if there’s strong evidence of lesions separated in space and time as shown above.      However, imaging should still be done as it helps confirm the burden of disease, and help rule out mimics such as other anatomic causes.        Discuss the natural history of MS – what is the prognosis for a newly diagnosed patient?           Recall that MS can either be Relapsing Remitting, or Progressive (primary or secondary).      Most patients have the relapsing remitting form, where the disease will intermittently get better and worse, with a variable degree of recovery.      Eventually relapsing remitting MS will progress to a secondary progressive MS, where there is gradual progression even between relapses.      However, a specific prognosis is difficult to make, since every patient has a different clinical course.      Case #2  Case Summary  Bharati is a 57 year old physician who has had headaches for over 30 years and you are the clinical clerk seeing her in her family physician’s office.  Her typical headache is a bilateral, throbbing head pain that is most pronounced posteriorly. The headache builds to maximum severity over 1‐2 hours and is treated with ibuprofen 600 mg; the headache usually resolves within 3‐4 hours of taking the ibuprofen. These headaches occur without warning and are associated with mild light sensitivity, nausea and neck stiffness. The headache increases in intensity when she climbs the stairs at work. Thirty years ago, the headaches occurred more than 10 days a month and were particularly severe just before menses. She was started on atenolol 50 mg once daily and increased to 50 mg twice daily after 2 weeks. With this, her headaches were reduced to a mild headache once a month two or three days before her menstrual cycle. Triggers such as sleep deprivation, stress and skipping meals will trigger headaches that are readily relieved by taking almotriptan 12.5 mg.  Family history is positive for headache in her mother and her son. She is otherwise healthy, does not smoke and drinks 1‐2 glasses of wine per week.  In the past 3 months, she has been bothered by increasing headaches, originally once per week but now occurring 4‐5 days per week. These headaches are also located posteriorly, accompanied by a feeling of neck stiffness and mild nausea. They are present in the morning on awakening, and then get better after she gets up and around but is taking longer to resolve this past week. The headaches do not interfere with sleep. Over the same period she has noticed increasing difficulty with reading, and wondering whether her bifocal prescription needs adjusting has scheduled an appointment with her optometrist in the next week. She has been otherwise well without fevers, myalgias or weight loss.  On examination, her blood pressure was 130/70 in the right arm seated. Pulse was 66 beats per minute regular. No tenderness or nodularity with palpation of the superficial temporal arteries. No signs of meningeal irritation. Her chest was clear and heart sounds were normal.  On neurological examination, she appeared well and was fluent and articulate. Her pupils were equal and briskly reactive on direct and consensual testing to light. With the swinging flashlight test, the left eye dilated 2 mm upon swinging the flashlight from the right eye to the left. VA corrected revealed 20/20 OD and 20/70 OS. Visual fields were full to confrontation. You didn’t see the optic discs well and planned to ask your preceptor to check this. Otherwise, eye movements were full with no nystagmus and symmetric facial movement. Bedside hearing was normal. Sensation to pinprick and vibration in the arms and legs was normal. Bulk, tone and power were normal. Deep tendon reflexes were 3+ symmetrical and down‐going toes bilaterally. Normal coordination and gait.Questions  What is the diagnosis for her typical headaches? How did you make this diagnosis?          Migraine without aura.                  Corroborative Features → throbbing, unilateral, nausea or vomiting, worse with activity, photophobia and phonophobia.          Also found to have a family history, and headaches are associated with triggers (hormonal changes).                    Since she doesn’t have a preceding aura (visual changes), this isn’t a Migraine with aura.        What features of her most recent headaches are relevant and why? Why is this not giant cell arteritis?          Recent changes in the nature of headaches:                  Increased frequency, recent onset, progressive.          Worsening pattern of headache.          This suggests that this is a new problem versus her pre-existing problem.                    Findings on examination:                  L RAPD is present, suggests impaired afferent signal in L eye.          Impaired visual acuity in the L eye corroborates this.                    This is NOT giant cell arteritis because:                  There’s no tenderness over the superficial temporal arteries.          Different pain presentation (GCA has a ‘boring, aching pain’).          No associated symptoms (fever, malaise, night sweats, weight loss).                      What does the “swinging flashlight” test assess? What info does this give you?          Described in the previous case.      Here, it suggests an afferent defect in the L eye.        Her visual fields to confrontation were normal. Do you need to do anything else? What would you expect to find if there was a problem anterior to the optic chiasm? Posterior to the optic chiasm?          Visual field testing via confrontation is fairly non-specific; referral to ophthalmology for formal field assessment is idea.      Lesions anterior to the optic chiasm → monocular deficits.      Lesions of the crossing fibres of the optic chiasm → bitemporal hemianopsia.      Lesions posterior to the optic chiasm → homonymous hemianopsia.        What investigations would you order? Be specific – what are you looking for and when do you want this/these test(s) done?          MRI of optic nerve and orbit.      Referral to ophthalmology.      Depending on imaging, referral to Neurosurgery may be indicated.      Case #3  History of Present Illness  Mary is a 49 year old woman referred to the Neurology Clinic for involuntary movements. She was accompanied by Sudeep, her husband of 20 years. Over the past 6 to 9 months, Sudeep has noticed that Mary has become increasingly fidgety. He points out to you the jerking movements of her hands and also tells you she her walking has changed. Mary has a lengthy history of depression and anxiety that has prevented her from working fulltime for over 10 years. Her psychiatrist had noticed the movements and had discussed referral for neurology consultation with her family physician.  Past medical history is significant for depression and anxiety with one hospitalization 3 years ago for suicidal ideation. She is currently taking venlafaxine extended release 150 mg/d. She has been on a number of other anti-depressant medications in the past but did not have a list with her. NKDA She is a non-smoker, drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week and does not use street drugs.  Family History: Mary’s mother is 76-years-old with a history of migraines, hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. There is cardiovascular disease on the maternal side. Her father committed suicide at age 32. He had not been close to his family although Mary thinks that there may be a history of depression in his family. She has 2 healthy, maternal half-siblings. Mary and Sudeep have 2 healthy children, age 17 and 21.  Examination  Mary is slightly disheveled with a flat affect. She appeared restless and fidgety during the interview. She scored 29/30 on the MMSE (she has a university degree) losing one point for spelling WORLD backwards (DLOW). Her speech was fluent without dysarthria. She had involuntary, rapid, irregular jerking movements of the hands with unusual posturing movements of her trunk. There was no predictable pattern to the movements, although they often ended in adjustments of her eye glasses or her clothing. Her feet were also restless, but to a lesser degree. Cranial nerve examination was normal; although she had trouble sticking her tongue out (would protrude but not keep it out). Motor examination revealed normal bulk and power. Sensory examination was normal. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+, symmetrical with flexor plantar responses. Her gait was very unusual with staggering with accentuation of the abnormal hand and finger movements.Questions  What is the word used to describe the involuntary movements of this patient (also shown in the video)?          Chorea.        Broadly classify involuntary movements and list 2 other types of abnormal involuntary movements.          Hyperkinetic → increased movement.                  Choreiform → irregular jerky movements.          Athetosis → twisting and writhing movements, often associated with choreiform movements (‘choreoathetoid’)          Tremors → physiological, action tremors, resting tremors, intention tremors. Characterized by regular and rhythmic movement.          Myoclonus → brief involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles (like those jerks you make when you’re falling asleep).          Dystonia → sustained, abnormal muscle contraction.          Tic → stereotyped muscle contraction.                    Hypokinetic → decreased movement.                  Akinesia → inability to initiate movement.          Bradykinesia → slowness of movement.          Dysarthria → difficulty in speech production.                      List 4 causes of chorea.          Drugs → eg. Levodopa.      Huntington’s Disease.      Benign Familial Chorea.      Hyperthyroidism.      Lupus (it could always be Lupus!)        What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? How would you verify this?            Huntington’s Disease, since Huntington’s classically presents with (1) motor, (2) psychiatric, and (3) cognitive issues. This patient has some evidence of all 3.      The age of onset also agrees, and she isn’t on any drugs that could potentially cause the choreiform symptoms.      Huntington’s affects the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen); you can actually see gross atrophy on imaging or pathology (see right).        What is the relevance of Mary’s psychiatric history?          As mentioned above, psychiatric findings corroborate a diagnosis of Huntington’s.        What is the risk, if any, to Mary’s children? Is there a role for predictive testing?          They do have a significant risk, especially due to anticipation.      Since the children are of an age where they can make their own decisions, testing should be up to them.      Since Huntington’s has no cure, predictive testing likely will not change clinical decision making, especially while they’re still asymptomatic.      The overwhelming majority of people actually choose not to be tested.        Define anticipation as it relates to this case.          Anticipation → where the onset of a disease begin earlier and earlier with successive generations.      Seen with trinucleotide repeat disorders, where the repeated area expands with subsequent generations.

Diagnose and treat spasticity.  Understand how to diagnose and treat autonomic dysreflexia.  Understand what happens in the rehabilitation of SCI.  Objective      Review pathophysiology and epidemiology of SCI.  Introduction to Spinal Cord Injury  Motor vehicle crashes are the #1 cause of SCI in Canada.  Young people (18-24 y/o) are most at risk.  15% of injuries are actually made worse by the initial care that they receive (eg. by moving the patient’s neck while moving them).  The majority of spinal cord recovery is within the first 6 months to a year; however, many patients can have a more protracted recovery process.  Spinal cord injury has wide ranging complications:          Osteoporosis → due to a reduction in weight bearing.      Autonomic Dysfunction → impaired thermoregulation, blood pressure changes, peripheral vasodilation (increasing risk of DVTs).      Spasticity → due to this being an UMN problem.      Impaired Respiration → if above C3/4/5.      Heterotopic Ossification → bone deposition in abnormal locations (mechanism is unknown).      Types of Spinal Cord Injury  Broadly speaking, spinal cord injury can be classified as either traumatic or non-traumatic:          Traumatic → impairment of spinal cord or cauda equina function resulting from an external force. Typically has a sudden onset.      Non-traumatic → impairment of spinal cord or cauda equina function resulting from an internal force (ie. a degenerative or disease process). Typically caused by spinal stenosis, tumour, ischemia, transverse myelitis, infections, etc.      Pathophysiology of Spinal Cord Injury  With a spinal cord injury, a primary insult results in a secondary pathology.          A primary insult includes things like compression or tissue disruption.      A secondary pathology includes the body’s immune response, the release of toxic excitatory amino acids (glutamate), and free radical release.        As with the peripheral nerves, the extent of axonal sparing influences the degree of functional return.          This explains the degree of variability in functional outcomes between people.      Since the degree of axonal involvement varies widely with injury, everyone has different functional consequences!        Objective      Differentiate between tetraplegia and paraplegia, SCI syndromes.  Tetraplegia vs Paraplegia  Tetraplegia (Quadraplegia):          All 4 limbs affected.      SCI between C1 and T1.      Loss of motor and/or sensory function in any of head, neck, shoulder, upper chest, arms, hands, and/or fingers.        Paraplegia:          Lower limbs affected.      SCI between T2 and S5.      Loss of motor and/or sensory function in any of middle of the chest, stomach, hips, legs and feet, and/or toes.        Objective      Understand what happens in the rehabilitation of SCI.

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS LECTURE.  Recall that the autonomic nervous system includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.          Sympathetic innervation comes from T1-L2 (sympathetic chain).      Parasympathetic innervation comes from CN 3, 7, 9, 10, and spinal cord segments S2-4.        Autonomic Dysreflexia → a massive unbalanced reflex sympathetic discharge in response to a noxious stimulus. Seen with a spinal cord injury above T6.          Mechanism → whenever there’s a noxious stimulus below the level of the lesion, it results in a reflex release of the SNS below the level of the lesion.      Since the descending input to the SNS is interrupted due to the injury, there’s no central regulation of the SNS output.        Why does the lesion have to be above T6?          There’s a big vascular pool (the splanchnic vascular pool) at the level of T6.      With lesions above T6, the spinal cord is unable to regulate vasoconstriction at this pool.      Result → HR increases, BP increases; effect persists until the noxious stimulus stops.        What about the parasympathetic response?          Recall that there are baroreceptors near the bifurcation of the common carotid, so there is a central response.      However, although the brain can stimulate a PSNS response via the vagus, which slows the heart, the PSNS response can’t cause skeletal muscle vasodilation.      So the HR will go down, but the BP will still be very high.        End result:          Parasympathetic findings above lesion → flushing of the face, stuffy nose, blurred vision, slow heart rate.      Sympathetic findings below lesion → elevated BP, pouding headache, goosebumps, skin pallor, sweating.      Autonomic Dysreflexia: MASSIVE UNBALANCED REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DISCHARGE WITH SCI ABOVE T6.- Overactivity of sympathetic nervous system.- Mechanism:	-  noxious stimulus below the level of the lesion.	-  Reflex release of the SNS below the level of the lesion.	-  However, the descending input to the SNS is interrupted -&gt; cannot provide interruption of SNS.Big vascular pool (splanchnic vascular pool) at T6; lose ability to regulate with lesions T6 or above.	- HR goes up.	- BP goes up.	- Continues to go up until something tells it to stop.	- Baroreceptors in brain; but has to send signals back down the spinal cord; and you’re impeded there.	- Can only send info to vagus; slows heart, but can’t impact blood vessels.	- Still have skeletal muscle vasoconstriction.Parasympathetic above lesion  Flushing of face Stuffy nose Blurred vision  Slow heart rateSympathetic below lesion  Elevated blood pressure Pounding Headache Goosebumps Pallor of the skin SweatingSystolic of 250-300 and diastolic of 200-220 have been reported9 BradycardiaTRIGGERS: Triggering factors  **Bladder distention** (MOST COMMON)- CATHETERIZATION CAN OFTEN IMPROVE THIS. Bowel distention/impaction  Ulcer Ingrown toenail Sex/Orgasm Pregnancy/Delivery  CystoscopyBaby = noxious stimulus, plus compression at T6.May result in autonomic dysreflexia. 2/3 of women, T6 and above during labour  Consideration for epidural Need skilled staffComplications include:  Retinal hemorrhage Subarachnoid hemorrhage  Intracerebral hemorrhage MI Seizure DEATH!!!!Acutely1.

C6 level injury so biceps and deltoid are somewhat preserved.Don’t need all 3 heads of deltoid for f(x); reattach one head of deltoid to triceps to become a ‘triceps’.ECRB = C6.ECRL = C6.Take one, weave through interosseus membrane, to flexor digitorum superficialis for gripping.Brachioradialis = C5; already have brachialis and biceps; can insert into the thumb!!Pretty neat. Just like nerve transfers.Takes about 6 months before old muscle works like new muscle.Stem cells = getting there.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/04/21/spinal-cord-injury.html"},
	{"title": "Approach to Neurologic Problems", "text": "Lecture Objectives  List the 5 steps to approaching a neurologic problem.  Describe the value of normal and abnormal neurologic exam findings in localization of problems.  Apply “where is the lesion” (localization) and “what is the lesion” (etiology) to clinical vignettes.Case Example  Case Summary      48 y/o man wakes with weakness of the left face.    He had difficulty drinking his coffee; spilling out of the corner of his mouth. His partner told him his face was ‘crooked’. He has mild discomfort behind the left ear. With the exception of a mild URTI, he has been otherwise well.    He has hypertension and is on hydrochlorothiazide.    BP 128/76; HR 66 reg; afebrile    Normal tympanic membranes    CN exam:              Full extraocular movements        Weakness of left frontalis (forehead), eye closure and grimace        Tongue and palate midline        No pronator drift        Normal tone, power, reflexes and toes ↓↓              Where does this localize and why?          Peripheral nerve; CN VII (Facial nerve).      The involvement of the ipsilateral forehead, lack of a pronator drift, and downward pointing toes suggest that this isn’t an UMN problem.      If the forehead wasn’t involved, and there were UMN signs, it’d be more suggestive of a cortical problem.        What is the significance of the:          Normal tympanic membranes? → CN VII travels through the middle ear, so this helps rule out possible etiologies.      Presence of full extraocular movements? (particularly horizontal) → the abducens nerve comes out of the brainstem beside the facial nerve (at the junction between the pons and medulla).       Absence of a pronator drift? → a pronator drift is a sign of a UMN problem; so the absence of a pronator drift suggests a LMN problem.        What can cause problems with the facial nerve?          Bell’s Palsy → most common, idiopathic.      Ramsay-Hunt syndrome → where you have reactivation of herpes zoster that lies in the geniculate ganglion (collection of fibres and sensory neurons from the facial nerve).                  Here, you can see vesicles in the ear and mouth, which are signs that help suggest that this isn’t due to an idiopathic Bell’s palsy.                    General Approach to Neurological Problems  There are 5 main steps:          History      Physical Exam.      “Where is the lesion”; ie. localization.      “What is the lesion”; ie. differential diagnosis.      Investigations, management, red flags.      History  Focus on localization, and ruling out possible hypotheses.  The HISTORY IS CRUCIAL:          Is this a nervous system problem or not?      The acuteness of the condition helps narrow down the diagnosis.        Rate of onset:          Abrupt → instantaneous to minutes (eg. stroke/TIA, seizures, syncope).      Acute → hours to days (eg. bacterial meningitis, subdural hematoma, Guillain Barre).      Subacute → weeks to months (eg. fungal meningitis, tumours).      Chronic → months to years (eg. hereditary, degenerative).      Neurologic Exam  Test the hypotheses you generated from the history.  Know the significance of normal/abnormal exam findings; both are important.  Components of the Neurologic Exam:          Mental status → LOC, orientation, attention, language, memory, higher order cortical functions.                  Language problems would suggest a cortical problem (eg. Broca’s or Wernicke’s area).          Level of consciousness could involve the ascending reticular activating system in the brainstem.                    Cranial Nerves      Motor → bulk, involuntary movements, tone, power, reflexes, toes.      Sensory → small fibre and large fibre (primary modalities); cortical sensation (graphesthesia, stereognosis).      Coordination → cerebellar findings.      Gait.        Mental Status          LOC; orientation, attention, language, memory.      Language assessment consists of 6 parts:                  Spontaneous speech → fluent or non-fluent.          Comprehension → first simple, then complex.          Naming → at least 2 objects; go from simple to complex.          Repetition → start simple, then increase to “no ifs, ands, or buts”.          Reading → read an instruction out load and follow the instruction.          Writing → have the patient write a sentence for you.                    In practice, we only really do the first 4 (which we also saw in PCCM); reading and writing are rarely assessed clinically.        Cranial Nerves          II → important because it’s actually considered a CNS tract, and has a long path from the retina to the occipital lobe.      III, IV → come off the midbrain.      V-VII → come off the pons (or ponto-medullary junction).      IX, X, XII → come off the medulla.        Motor → UMN or LMN (Dr. Shoesmith’s lecture).          Bulk (inspection) and tone (palpation).      Power      Reflexes &amp; toes.        Sensory:          Small fibre/spinothalamic pathway → pinprick &amp; temperature.       Large fibre/dorsal column pathway → vibration and proprioception      Pick one sensory modality from each pathway to test.      Pinprick and vibration are the most sensitive, so it’s best to test both.      In addition, crude touch is localized to the spinothalamic tract, while fine/discriminative touch is localized to the dorsal column.        Coordination:          Rapid alternating movements; finger-to-nose; heel-to-shin; tandem gait; romberg.        Gait:          Pattern recognition → describe what you see.      Antalgic gait, tredelenberg gait.      Localization  Combine clues from your history and physical.  Use the neuroanatomy that you may (or may not) know.  First differentiate a central versus peripheral cause:          Central → cerebral hemispheres (cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule), brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord.      Peripheral → anterior horn cell, roots &amp; plexus, spina and cranial nerves, neuromuscular junction, muscle.        What are key differentiating features? (review)          UMN → spasticity, hyperreflexia, upgoing toes.      LMN → reduced tone, hypo/areflexia, downgoing toes, fasciculations.        CAUTION → don’t be confused with ‘non-localizing’ neurologic symptoms.          These include headache, nausea &amp; vomiting, restlessness, confusion, generalized seizures, coma.      All may be seen with neurologic dysfunction.      Differential Diagnosis  What is the lesion → this will inform next steps.  Focus on the important stuff:          Most likely diagnosis.      Life-threatening diagnoses or other things you wouldn’t want to miss.      Treatable conditions that might change management.        Your investigations &amp; management plan will be based on this differential.Plan &amp; Management  Investigations and Management:          Follows on the heels of the differential diagnosis      Takes into consideration the acuity, severity, patient characteristics, test characteristics, etc.      Know the red flags which will change your usual approach        Red Flags (we’ve seen these many times).          Fever, weight loss, anorexia, night sweats.      Bowel and bladder dysfunction.      ‘Worst ever’ or ‘first ever’.      History of IVDU, immunocompromised, etc.      Recent travel to certain locations.      Progressive symptoms and signs.      Abnormal neurologic exam.

	{"title": "Advanced Care Directives", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define advance care planning and explain its importance.  Describe the steps of advance care planning.  Describe the role of the patient, substitute decision maker and physician.  Identify pitfalls and limitations.  Utilize the planning to prepare a directive.  Objective      Define advance care planning and explain its importance.  Advanced Care Directives  Definition → Advance Care Planning is:          “A process of communication among the patient, other family members, and health care providers for the purpose of making decisions about the patient’s future medical care and in doing so, clarifying treatment preferences and developing individual goals of care”.        The directive is the final written document.          In other words, it’s the end result of your discussions.      The ultimate goal of the directive is to make decisions not based on what you or the patient’s family wants, but rather what the patient would have wanted.      This can often be a tremendous source of frustration and conflict, when the family’s views differ from that of the patient.        How do do Advance Care Planning effectively?          Educate the patient with regards to their diagnosis, prognosis, cause of illness, and likely outcomes.      Don’t use medical jargon.      Prognosis is less about ‘how much time do I have left’ and more about describing to the patient how the disease will progress.      This has to be in the context of the patient’s goals, expectations, etc (FIFE all over again).        What does a plan include?          Specific care plans for specific circumstances.      Identification of substitute decision makers for when the patient is no longer able to speak for themselves.      Living wills, Power of Attorney documentation if applicable.        What are the benefits of Advance Care Planning?          Simplifies care by removing unwanted interventions.      Relieves the family of the burden of having to deduce what their loved ones might have wanted.      Gives the patient a sense of control over the final chapter of their lives.        Who should initiate Advance Care Planning?          Ideally the family physician, oncologist, nurse, or anyone who has an ongoing doctor-patient relationship.      It’s better to have someone who is familiar with the patient do this rather than a stranger.        When should Advance Care Planning be done?          Ideally when the patient is well.      Realistically, this is often after the patient has been diagnosed with a significant illness (eg. CHF, COPD, cancer).        Objective      Describe the steps of advance care planning.    5 steps for successful advance care planning          Introduce the topic.      Engage in structured discussions.      Document patient preferences.      Review and update.      Apply the directives when need arises.        Introduce the topic          Be straightforward, determine how familiar the patient it is with the process.      Determine their comfort level with the topic.      Most patients expect the physician to raise the topic, so if you don’t do it, they won’t bring it up.      If the patient is deemed capable, discuss things with them.      If the patient is deemed incapable, the SDM is contacted.       If there’s no designated SDM, there’s a hierarchy that you follow (recall from ethics): spouse/partner → children → parents → siblings → other relatives.        Engage in structured discussions          Ensure the SDM is present.      Describe possible scenarios, options for care.      Elicit what the patients values and goals are.      Use a guide/worksheet to ensure that you cover everything. Make sure there are no inconsistencies.      These discussions are often difficult; patient denial or unrealistic expectations can often be a significant barrier.      Since we have drugs that allow patients to live longer, it often becomes difficult to know when to engage in the dialogue of dying.        Document patient preferences          Sign the documentation, enter it in the medical record.      Recommend having documents at home for the Fire Department or Ambulance, so they don’t undergo unnecessary resuscitation.      Reassure patients that a DNR ≠ DNT (do not treat).                  Patients often believe that having a DNR in their chart means that they will have a lower quality of care.                    People mistakenly believe that resuscitation is more effective than it really is.                  People believe the success rate is as high as 45%, and 64% of elderly believe they should have CPR if they have a cardiac arrest.          Furthermore, 75% of family members believe that CPR should be done.          However, even in healthy patients, the discharge rate from the hospital is as low as 5-12%          In chronically ill patients, of the 10-25% of those who responded to CPR and make it to the hospital, 100% ended up dying, often in serious pain.                      Review and update          Follow up periodically, and note major life events.      Discuss document changes; the advanced care directive isn’t a static document!      Quality end-of-life care is a dynamic process that is negotiated and re-negotiated        Apply the directives when need arises          Determine applicability of the document.      Read and interpret the advanced directive.      Consult with the SDM, refer to the ethics committee for disagreements.      Carry out the treatment plan.

	{"title": "Child Health Small Groups &ndash; Febrile Seizures &amp; the Floppy Infant", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Given a history of a child presenting with a paroxysmal event and fever, list a differential diagnosis.  Describe the characteristic features of typical (simple) febrile seizures and atypical (complex) febrile seizures.  For a child with a febrile seizure, determine whether investigations are indicated.  In a child with a febrile seizure, outline a treatment plan and provide a prognosis.  Describe the aspects of the history and physical examination that would support a diagnosis of meningitis in a child with a fever and seizure.  List preventive strategies, complications and long term prognosis for childhood meningitis.Case #1  Case Summary  You are asked to evaluate Markus, a 15 month old boy, brought to the emergency department by ambulance.  What would be your first step?          ABCs, Vitals.        Additional Information  Marcus is quiet in his mother’s arms. When you move him to the examining table he begins to cry. He is pink in room air. Air entry is equal bilaterally.  RR = 25 HR = 165 BP = 88/52 Temp = 39.4 C  You obtain some additional history from Markus’ mother:  Markus was well until this morning when he developed a fever (39.5-40 C). His mother gave him a 120 mg of acetaminophen. About 20 minutes ago, Markus was sitting with his mother when Markus’ eyes rolled back and both arms and legs began to shake. He looked pale and did not respond to his name. Markus mother was very alarmed and her husband called 911. The shaking stopped after 4-5 minutes and Markus went limp. He never stopped breathing. In the ambulance Markus woke up and began crying. Now he is drowsy, but seems to be returning to his usual self.  In general, what conditions would you consider for a paroxysmal event such as this? What would be most likely in a 15 month old?          Meningitis; in this case, since he has a fever.      More generally, seizure and syncope are the most common causes for a transient LOC.      Other causes include hypoglycemia, migraines, BPPV, and breath-holding spells.        What further information would you want to get in the history?          Take a full pediatric history; focus on family history.      Events before and after the seizure.      Immunizations, allergies, medications, as usual.        What are the most common considerations in the differential diagnosis for seizures associated with fever? What is the most likely diagnosis for Markus?          Most common diagnosis: simple febrile seizure.      You would want to rule out meningitis.        How are febrile seizures defined? How common are febrile seizures? At what age do they occur most often?          Febrile seizure → seizure associated with high body temperature, with no other systemic findings.      Up to 5% of children will get them.      They occur most often between the ages of 6 months to 6 years.        Additional Information  Markus had been unwell for 1 day with a high fever, cough and nasal congestion. Just prior to the seizure, he was alert but resting in his mother’s arms. There is no vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or fussiness.  Past medical history is unremarkable.  Family history is significant for an uncle who has epilepsy and a cousin with febrile seizures.  How are febrile seizures classified?          Simple (benign) → lasts less 15 minutes, does not recur within a 24 hour period, no neurologic findings.      Complex (atypical) → focal features OR lasts longer than 15 minutes OR pre-existing neurological conditions OR more than 1 in 24 hours OR outside of normal age range (6 mo to 6 years).        What would you look for on the physical exam?          Signs of meningitis → Kernig’s, Brudzinski’s, nuchal rigidity, headache, fever, etc.      Signs of infection.      Growth parameters.      Skin findings suggestive of an underlying diagnosis.        Additional Information  On exam: Height = 83 cm Weight = 12.6 kg HC = 48.8 cm  He is alert, prefers to be with his mother, and is otherwise is in no distress. His mother says he is quieter than usual. There is no bruising or neurocutaneous stigmata. Anterior fontanelle is just palpable and almost closed. Pupils are equal and reactive. Extra ocular movements are conjugate. The red reflex is present bilaterally and the fundi are normal. There is no sunsetting of the eyes. The Brudzinski and Kernig signs are difficult to assess. Neurologically, he moves both arms and legs equally. His tone appears normal.  His mouth exam shows moist mucosa without erythema. There is a clear nasal discharge. The tympanic membranes are non-inflamed. Respirations are regular. The rest of the examination is normal.  What do you conclude?          Growth parameters are normal; 95th percentile for age. No micro or macrocephaly.      Neuro exam is normal; suggests it’s likely benign.      Sounds like a simple febrile seizure.        Additional Information  A dose of acetaminophen is given and he improves considerably over the next 30 minutes. His mother reports that he is back to his usual self.  What investigations would you do for Markus?          CBC, lytes, glucose.       Would you do a lumbar puncture? Probably not, since he seems to be improving.      Would you do an EEG? Not recommended; after a simple febrile seizure, may often find changes on EEG, but they often don’t mean anything; no predictive value for prognosis.        Should this child be admitted?          No; he seems healthy.      It ultimately depends on their social situation; if it’s a single parent or they live far away from the hospital, admitting them might be better.        Under what circumstances should a child be admitted?          Very young.      Abnormalities on bloodwork.      Growth abnormalities.      Residual neurological deficits, focal neurological symptoms.      Signs of meningitis.      Social circumstance; distressed parents, single parent, lives far away.        How would you treat Markus once he’s home?          Tylenol/ibuprofen for comfort.      Reassure parents that isolated simple febrile seizures have no long term consequences; prognosis for development is very good.      Tell them that if they have another seizure, wait 5 minutes if seizes again; if longer than 5 minutes, call EMS right away.        What is the prognosis for children with simple febrile seizures?          Prognosis is very good; no impact on long-term development or IQ.        What is the probability of developing epilepsy?          Up to 4%.      Baseline ~ 1%.        What factors increase the risk of recurrent febrile seizures?          Increased risk of epilepsy: FHx, complex vs simple seizures, # of seizures, AbN neurological exam.      Increased risk of febrile seizures: younger age of onset, mildness of fever, time between onset of fever and onset of seizure.        How would you counsel Markus’ mother?          Reassure mother as before.      Wouldn’t recommend an anti-epileptic since this is a simple febrile seizure.      If have another seizure:                  Put on side; to prevent airway obstruction.          Contact EMS if seizures haven’t stopped after 5 minutes.                    In rare situations, extreme parental anxiety about recurrent, severe simple febrile seizures warrants prophylaxis at the beginning of each febrile illness. This is not routinely recommended. Oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg Q8 hours at the beginning of a febrile illness) is the only medication recommended in such circumstances.      Case #2  Case Summary  Six year old Sammy presents to the emergency department with fever, lethargy and a possible seizure. Sammy was well until 3 days ago when he developed fever, malaise, clear nasal discharge and decreased appetite. Sammy’s mother suspected an ear infection. This morning Sammy complained of head and neck pain and was given ibuprofen. He stayed home from school. He had little energy and looked pale. He vomited twice.  Approximately 20 minutes before arrival in the ER, Sammy’s left arm and leg began to shake. When this did not stop Sammy’s mother called for an ambulance. By then his entire body began shaking and Sammy was unresponsive and looked dusky.  What is your differential diagnosis for Sammy’s presentation? Which diagnosis is most likely?          Meningitis.      Focal seizure.      Encephalitis, brain abscess, tumour.        How does the presentation of meningitis differ in an infant vs. an older child?          More non-specific findings, such as loss of appetite, and lethargy.      Will often have concomitant infections.        Additional Information  Exam findings: Temp 40.0°C, HR=100, RR=25 (irregular), BP 120/90, Wt=20kg.  Sammy is lethargic and difficult even for his mother to arouse. He looks pale and unwell. He seems bothered by the brightly lit examination room and keeps his neck rigid. He has positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs. His tympanic membranes are red and bulging. The pupils are reactive. His heart, lungs and abdomen are normal. His color is pink but his hands and feet are cool to touch. He moves all his extremities weakly but symmetrically. The deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally.  Why is Sammy’s neck stiff? What are Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs?          Due to inflammation of the meninges.      Kernig’s sign → straight leg raise causes pain due to stretching of the meninges.      Brudzinski’s sign → flexion of the head causes hip flexion to relieve stretching of the meninges.        What features of Sammy’s presentation are characteristic of meningitis? How else can this illness present?          Preceding signs of infection.      Lethargic, decreased LOC, photophobic, positive Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs.      In general, if there’s a meningitides infection, may have a meningococcal rash.      In younger patients,         What would you do next (and why)?          Empiric AbX.      Blood cultures, blood work.      CT to r/o cranial lesion.      If CT normal, then LP.                  Gram Stain.          Culture &amp; Sensitivity          WBC Count + Differential          Protein &amp; Glucose.                      When is an LP contraindicated?          Focal neuro signs.      Stuperous/comatose.      Bleeding disorder.      Infection at site of puncture.        Why would increased ICP warrant a CT scan before a lumbar puncture can be done?          To avoid the risk of herniation with loss of ICP with drawing out of CSF.        What are most common offending organisms of bacterial meningitis in an older child? Is this different from the most common offenders in infants?          In older children and adults, gram positives are more common. In younger children, gram negatives are more common.      More common in older child:                  Strep. pneumoniae          Neisseria Meningitidis                    More common in infants:                  E. coli          Strep. agalactiae (GBS) (GS +, but also possible)                      Additional Information  A stat CT scan of the brain is normal. The LP results are as follows:                    Value        Result        Normal Range                            Opening Pressure:        150 mm H2O        (50-180 mm H2O)                    WBC        4500/µL        (&lt; 4 / µL)                    Neutrophils        85%        (1-3%)                    RBC        2 / µL        (0-3 / µL)                    Glucose        2.1 mmol/L        (2.2-3.9 mmol/L)                    Protein        980 mg/L        (80-320 mg/L)              What do you conclude? Why?          He has meningitis.      From the GS, it’s most likely to be Strep. pneumoniae.        How will he be managed?          Systemic antibiotics (Ceftriaxone + Vancomycin).      Dexamethasone to reduce inflammation and reduce risk of deafness.      IV fluids.        What are the complications of meningitis in children?          Acute → Seizures, coma, death, SIADH.      Long-term → deafness, learning disabilities, hydrocephalus, paresis.        How can bacterial meningitis in children be prevented?          Immunizations -&gt; prevnar for pneumococcus, Hib for hemophilus, menjugate for meningococcus.      Prompt treatment even with low clinical suspicion.        Who is most at risk of bacterial meningitis?          Young children, unimmunized, non-breast fed (receive Abs from maternal milk).      Hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell anemia (spleen dysfunction).      Immunocompromised.      Case #3  Case Summary  You are called to assess a male newborn of 9 hr old who has not yet fed well and that thenurses have found to be extremely “floppy”.  Jose was born at 36 weeks gestation following a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios and concerns regarding decreased fetal movements. Labour required augmentation with oxytocin. Birth weight was 3.0 kg. Extra suctioning was needed and bag mask ventilation was provided for the first 2 minutes of life.  The nurses are concerned Jose’s poor suck and fatigue with feeding. They would like you to start an IV. Jose has had brief intermittent episodes of tachypnea.  Jose’s mother has had one prior miscarriage. She has not been working over the past few years. In the maternal family history there are several family members with cataracts. Mother’s sister has had several miscarriages.  Weakness = active.  Hypotonia = passive.  Hypotonic may not necessarily have weakness; patient with weakness also probably hypotonic.  Neonatal, 80% central, 20% peripheral. Here, more likely peripheral since deep tendon reflexes absent. Also facial muscle weakness (ptosis). Child seems alert (less likely to be central).  Central: dysmorphic features, axial hypotonia, etc.EMG for musclesNCS for nerves.Would you give IV fluids? If acutely dehydrated yes; otherwise NG tube.Progression; congenital form is more severe. Something that you’d pass on. Life expectancy is decreased.Motor delay, probably no cognitive delay; however for some reason the congenital form DOES have cognitive delay.What is the expected course for this child?Given the genetics of this disorder and the findings in this family, what other factors will need to be considered?- Feeding will be difficult due to swallowing weakness.- Feeding study; if suggestive of choking; g tube (ng tube only temporary).- Respiratory function is at risk; respiratory compromise. Increased risk of choking, aspiration pneumonia.- Other manifestations of myotonic dystrophy:	- Cataracts.	- Diabetes (T2DM).	- Males are infertile (testicular atrophy), can often be later in life if not congenital.	- Frontal baldness.	- Congenital form can also AV blockage.Prolonged hospitalization, infertility, cognitive f(x), etc.Autosomal dominant + risk of anticipation (increased risk of congenital myotonic dystrophy with other children).Reassure mother that it’s not her fault; avoid assigning blame.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/04/16/child-health-small-groups-floppy-infant.html"},

Hence start even with low degree of confidence.INVESTIGATIONS.LISTEN FROM HERE.If child has focal findings or papilledema, then do imaging first to make sure there is no structural risk of herniation – want to know if there is free communication of fluid between brain and spinal cord; the problem occurs when you create a pressure differential between brain and spinal cord; want CSF to equilibrate in pressure.If you mess up and ICP was high and you did an LP, leave needle in, and give a dose of mennitol quickly over 20 minutes; which will suck H20 out of brain; which will dehydrate brain and bring pressure down; give mannitol over 24 h until it’s safe to take needle out.If child still spiking fevers after 48 hours and neuro symptoms not returning to normal, then repeat LP.LP is rarely normal; if LP is normal, then the patient does NOT have meningitis.Side effects of LP: Low pressure headache; bed rest, fluids.Also traumatic tap (hit blood vessel on the way):	- To correct protein value: Subtract 1 mg protein /1000 rbcs.	- To correct wbcs, subtract 1 wbc/500-1000 rbcs.- Image only if focal neurological signs or stuperous/comatose.MEMORIZE THAT CHART FOR CSF FLUID EXAMINATION:Normal CSF: &lt;5 lympocytes, CSF glucose &gt;= 2/3 plasma conc. (so also gotta do blood glucose), protein &lt; 0.4YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THESE.Neonates have a DIFFERENT normal CSF.40-100 white cells. Predominantly monocytes and lympocytes. (no neutrophils, etc).Protein limit higher: &lt; 1.0 g/L.Acute bacterial meningitis = white count in THOUSANDS, almost all polymorphs. Protein up, glucose down.Partially treated bacterial meningitis (that kid with otitis media that you gave amox):- Here you’ll have attenuated findings; mix of polys and lymphs; glucose less low.Viral, protein N, except may go down if mumps.TREATMENT; copy these.Complications:Cerebral edema -&gt; decreased LOC.SIADH secretion -&gt; seizures.Mannitol can often reverse cerebral edema; significant improvements!Hydrocephalus; may be asymmetric if blockage only occurs on one side.Case ExamplesFROM FIRST PARAGRAPH; need to think of meningitis here; recall non-specific symptoms.DTRS = deep tendon reflexes symmetrical.Undiagnosed meningitis for at least 24 hours!! Day prior to admission; already had meningitis. White count was low because failed to mount an appropriate immune response. So massive protein = protein chewing through brain maybe!?!?! D: D:  Meningitis in infants and young children &lt; 2 years presents in a non-specific way, often masquerading as infection elsewheree.g. gastroenteritis and often without meningism.Maintain a high index of suspicion for meningitis.

	{"title": "Neurology &amp; Systemic Disease", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Integrate knowledge from cardiology, respirology, and nutrition into the assessment of neurological problems.  Using a systems approach, formulate appropriate differential diagnostic lists for loss of consciousness, dyspnea, and multifocal cerebral dysfunction.  Know the difference between syncope vs. seizure.  Know the neurological causes of dyspnea.  Be aware of neurological disorders caused by nutritional deficiencies.Case #1  Case Summary      A 54 year old male patient with presents to the emergency room with an episode of loss of consciousness.    He had been drying dishes and then said he wasn’t feeling well. His wife then saw him fall to the floor, have generalized stiffening of his muscles, and become unresponsive to her.    She called 911 and he was brought to ER.    On arrival, he was back to his normal self.    What is the differential for transient loss of consciousness?  With any neurological problem, a psychogenic cause is always on the differential, even if it’s not that common.          Syncope (hypotensive, cardiac).                  Cardiac causes → arrythmia, cardiac outflow obstruction (eg. aortic stenosis).          Hypotension → vasovagal episode, other cause of hypotension.                    Seizure.      Psychogenic seizure.      Rare causes (don’t need to know):                  TIA (transient ischemic attack)          Narcolepsy.          Acute increases in ICP (eg. acute hydrocephalus).                      Trauma is also a possibility, although there would be a precipitating history if that were the case.  Syncope vs. Seizure      Syncope can often seem very similar to seizure; differentiating factors are as follows:                               Syncope        Seizure                            Warning symptoms        Light headedness, nausea, palpitations        Aura possible but not necessary                    LOC        Sudden        Sudden                    Eyes        Open and may be deviated up        Open and may be deviated to one side                    Limb movements        None, tonic, or clonic movements        None, tonic, or clonic movements. May be asymmetrical                    Duration of LOC        10-60s        60s to multiple minutes                    Post ictal period        Brief disorientation for up to 5 minutes        Disorientation for several minutes up to several hours. May have Todd’s paresis                    Urinary incontinence        Rare        More common                    Tongue biting        None        Possible to lateral tongue              What are the most valuable differentiating features?          Asymmetry → a seizure will often have asymmetrical features due to a focal source; this isn’t the case with syncope.      Post-ictal period → a seizure will have a prolonged post-ictal period; a       Urinary incontinence → more common in seizure than syncope.      Tongue Biting → NOT seen with syncope, but possible with a seizure (to lateral tongue).        Evaluation of Syncope vs Seizure:          History.      Physical Examination.      Lab Investigations:                  EEG.          EKG, holter, echo → r/o cardiac causes.          Bloodwork → CBC, lytes.          Tilt table testing → test for orthostatic hypotension.          Occasionally Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (continuous EEG recording + video monitoring).                    Case #2  Case Summary      48 year old woman presents to her family doctor with progressive dyspnea over the last 2 months. There has been an occasional dry cough. The MD looks through her records and notes that she is otherwise healthy and is on no medications.    What are the broad categories of possibilities for her dyspnea?    What are general causes of dyspnea?          Cardiac → CHF, cardiac ischemia, cardiac outflow, etc.      Respiratory → asthma, COPD, etc.      Anemia      Neurological → due to weakness of the respiratory muscles. Rare relative to cardiac/resp/hematological problems.        ASDFKADF  Plexus, brain rule out because won’t cause dyspnea.      Rare central causes; ondine’s curse; loss of involuntary action of breathing.    Rest could theoretically cause respiratory muscle weakness.  Muscle = hereditary and inflammatory myopathies.  NMJ = myasthenia gravis.  Peripheral nerve = phrenic nerve palsy, GBS.  Root; multi-level cervivcal radiculopathy (C3,4,5).  Anterior horn cell: ALS; thoracic motor neurons often affected first (intercostal muscles)  Spinal cord:          High cervical myelopathy (above C3,4,5).      She complained of dyspnea which was more severe when she was lying down. She has taken to sleeping in a lazy boy chair so that she can be more upright. Milder SOB during the day.	- FROM THIS; ORTHOPNEA, sounds like CARDIAC CAUSE.• Denies: Ankle edema, chest pain, sputum production, extremity muscle weakness, diplopia, dysphagia• Exam: Normal cardiac exam, JVP normal, no peripheral edema, unremarkable chest auscultation, CN exam normal, muscle bulk and power normal, reflexes normal.• Diagnosis???Doesn’t sound like cardiac, or resp.What muscle does most of breathing when supine? Diaphragm (diaphragmatic paralysis).When upright, intercostals do more work.So this person had bilateral phrenic nerve palsy.TL;DR; RULE OUT CARDIAC/RESP/HEME causes, and only then consider neuro causes.• CXR to see if diaphragm moves.• Diaphragm fluoroscopy during inspiration/expiration• PFTs seated vs supine• Phrenic nerve conduction studies• Imaging of the neck and mediastinum -&gt; why is there phrenic nerve palsy (lesion, passes?)Case #3  Case Summary      9 year old girl choked on a pickle and developed a phobia of eating any foods. Despite parental encouragement, she would only drink coke, water or juice. Over the next several weeks, she started to stumble which her parents felt was related to her low calorie intake.    She was admitted to pediatrics for management of her weight loss and nutrition.    A NG feeding tube was placed on admission.    Within a day of the admission, she started to complain of diplopia. Her parents also stated she seemed confused.    On Examination:              Had difficult recounting a story that was just read to her.        Bilateral impairment of eye abduction, with nystagmus noted in adducting eyes        No nystagmus in primary position. Remainder of CN normal.        Power full throughout. Reflexes symmetrical and 2s throughout. Sensory exam normal.        Bilateral dysmetria with finger to nose testing and heel to shin testing. Severely ataxic gait.            Localization?- Bilateral 6th nerve palsy (brain stem or nerves going out) -&gt; ponto-medullary junction.- Dysmetria = bilateral cerebellar dysfunction.- Cognitive impairment!?!?!??!! How does this play into this? DOESN’T FITSince can’t be localized to a single part of the nervous system, this suggests generalized dysfunction with strong involvement of the pons.Dx: Wernicke’s Encephalopathy (Acute thiamine deficiency):Classic Triad:1.

Sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy  Wet beri-beri has associated cardiomyopathy  B12 deficiency:          Subacute combined degeneration      Dorsal column dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy        B6 toxicity: sensory neuropathy  Copper deficiency (often caused by impaired gastric adsorption such as due to bariatric surgery) – myelopathyHOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE DORSAL COLUMN DYSFUNCTION WITH A PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY?Large fibres = dorsal columns (position sensation + vibration)Dorsal columns do the same.What’s the difference? What’s also carried by large fibres but has a motor component? REFLEXES?So peripheral neuropathy should have diminished reflexesRetained reflexes = dorsal column.Re-feeding syndromeAfter prolonged calorie depletion, refeeding can cause significant electrolyte shifts into the cells- To begin regenerative process of cells; cells quiescent before, then become active, suck in electrolytes.• This can cause profound hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia.• What can this cause?Initially can cause encephalopathy (confusion, unsteadiness)• Next causes muscle weakness• If severe can cause seizures• Cardiac arrhythmias• If re-feeding a patient after prolonged anorexia, its imperative to start re-feeding very slowly and to check electrolytes frequently.Case #4  Case Summary      A 68 year old RHD man develops the acute onset of left arm numbness which persists. Two days later his wife notices word finding difficulties (he is substituting incorrect sounds or words). She takes him to ER.    In ER he has a mild temp at 37.9, HR 108 and regular. HS normal. Chest clear.    Neurological examination reveals: dysnomia, difficulty with repetition, impaired fluency but intact comprehension (follows 3 step commands).    Left homonymous hemianopsia.    Mild left pronator drift and slight impairment of rapid finger movements on left. Relative left sided hyperreflexia    Slight sensory deficit globally on left arm (75% of right)  Can you localize the lesion?CASE 4• Hints:• Where does the language deficit localize to?• Where does the homonymous hemianopsia localize to?• Where does the mild left sided sensory and motor deficit localize to?LOCALIZATION:- Broca’s aphasia (expressive/non-fluent aphasia)- Left homonymous hemianopsia.- L pronator drift, L weakness, L sensory deficit.HENCE RIGHT CORTEX- Broca’s aphasia = right frontal.- L homonymous hemianopsia = R occipital- L weakness/sensory = R cortical/subcortical.- Hence there are multifocal deficits.Seems like multiple clots -&gt; strokes going to multiple locations.Could also be MS.What do you think is going on?• What investigations would you like?CASE 4• Are there any other physical examination findings that you would like to look for?Possible causes:• Cardioembolic stroke• Cardioembolic stroke• Cardioembolic stroke• Cerebral vasculitis• Multifocal cerebral tumours (mets/lymphoma/etc)• Multiple cerebral abscesses• Demyelination (MS or ADEM = acute demyelinating encephalomyelpathy)CAUSES OF CARDIOEMBOLIC STROKES• Atrial fibrillation• Infectious endocarditis• Nonbacterial endocarditis • Cancer associated• Libman sacks endocarditis (LUPUS RELATED; INFLAMMATION RELATED!?!?!?)• Cardiac tumoursWhat should you look for?INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS!! Also has a low grade fever!!!!Features: Osler nodes = painful lesions of hand.Janeway lesions = painless lesions of fingersSplinter Hemorrhages FINGERNAILS &amp; TOENAILS.Roth spots = eye spots (red spots in back of fundus).Should you give this patient TPA? Even though he’s had new acute events, his initial event was 2 days ago. Long clogged blood vessels are very leaky, and at high risk of hemorrhage.The blood vessels distal to the obstruction will be ischemic. SO if you break off the old clot, the new ischemic blood vessels are leaky, and prone to rupture.This is why there’s only a limited WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY for using thrombolysis for a stroke.Even if this is the first stroke, and within window of opportunity, still a risk if Pt. has endocarditis.Infection can travel up through blood vessels, can cause aneurysm, prone to rupture.Hence no anticoagulation for people with endocarditis; just treat their infection (Abx, ask cardiac surgery if need valve replacement).Management of Stroke Patients with Suspected EndocarditisBlood cultures x 2 (why ? sometimes 1st culture negative; infected valve may only throw off bac intermittently).Ask lab to keep culture for possible HASEK organisms (take longer to culture):	Hemophilis, aggregibacter, cardiobacterium, eikenella, kingella.Transthoracic +/- tranesophageal echo.Investigate for source of bacteria (particularlydental)• If blood cultures negative, strongly consider possibility of Non-bacterial endocarditis secondary to malignancy.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/04/16/neurology-systemic-disease.html"},
	{"title": "Approach to the Floppy Infant", "text": "Lecture Overview  Definitions and Overview.  Considerations in the clinical encounter.  Localization and classification.  Examples.Definitions and OverviewSome Definitions  Tone → the resistance to passive motion around a joint.          Phasic tone → muscle response to a rapid stretch. Mediated by the deep tendon reflexes.      Postural tone → muscle response to low intensity (gravity) forces.        Hypotonia → low muscle tone with a passive stretch around a joint.What is a ‘Floppy Infant’?  ‘Floppy’ Features:          Low muscle tone (hypotonia).      Weakness.      Ligamentous laxity and flexibility of the joint.            Ligamentous laxity can be seen in connective tissue disorders such as Ehler-Danlos syndrome and Marfans syndrome, and can often be mistaken for hypotonia.    Recall that reflex arcs are negatively inhibited by CNS; loss of CNS innervation then results in hyper-reflexia.  Infant physiology is different, in that some descending central mediation pathways in that infants have low muscle tone.      Even some of the biochemical systems (eg. GABA) can have paradoxical phenomena in children.    Floppy infant often non-neurologic, not neurological.          Non-neurologic causes are manifold, and include: electrolyte disturbances, sepsis/infection, dehydration, visual impairment, hypothyroidism, cardiac disease, failure to thrive.        Of the neurological causes, the majority are central; the minority are peripheral, and an exceedingly rare amount are a combination of the two.  WAIT, DOESN’T A CENTRAL PROBLEM RESULT IN INCREASED TONE AND HYPERREFLEXIA?          THIS IS UNIQUE TO INFANTS.      Low tone can be a more protracted manifestation of central problems.      2001 study from Montreal, list of causes of floppy infants in children.Central causes = 33.Peripheral = 17.Variety of different causes.2005 study, 89 children with floppy infant presentation.Dx could be established in 60.Most are central, were a few peripheral causes.Considerations in the clinical encounterClinical considerations:• History:– Pregnancy: decreased fetal movement, breech presentation, perinatal difficulties.– Other signs of central problems: cognitive/language delay, seizures– Feeding– Respiratory– Cardiac– Family historyBrain drives a lot of other vital functions.Look also for signs that help differentiate b/w central and periphral (eg. seizures, cognitive/language delay).Clinical considerationsThe Floppy Infant• Neurological physical exam:– General position: frog leg, decreased – Reflexes: directly strike muscle– Tone– Reduced muscle mass– Arthrogryposis– Normal sensation– Visual alertnessArthrogryposis.describes congenital joint contractures in two or more areas of the body. It derives its name from Greek, literally meaning “curving of joints” (arthron, “joint”; grȳpōsis, late Latin form of late Greek grūpōsis, “hooking”).[1] Children born with one or more joint contractures have abnormal fibrosis of the muscle tissue causing muscle shortening, and therefore are unable to do passive extension and flexion in the affected joint or joints.img; postural hypotonia, extreme kyphosis of baby, legs splayed out to the side, lots of head support needed.Weakness vs hypotonia OR both.

Empiric antibiotic treatment (Ceftriaxone + Vancomycin) should be done right away.      This buys the patient more time, during which you can ship the patient to an area where there is a CT scanner.      In other words, empiric treatment, and then ship them out.

	{"title": "CNS Infections", "text": "Lecture Overview  First hour → lecture on the involved diseases.  Second hour → series of cases.Lecture Objectives  Given a history and physical examination, students should be able to make a diagnosis of the type of CNS infection present in the patient.  When asked, students should be able to outline a plan for managing suspected meningitis in the presence of altered sensorium and/or focal neurological findings.  When presented with the results of a CSF examination, the student should determine the type of meningitis afflicting the patient and the most common offending organisms.  Students should be able to write an antibiotic order for the empiric treatment of meningitis in the adult.  In a patient with herpes simplex encephalitis, students should list the antiviral therapy used.Infections of the Nervous System  There are 4 main types of CNS infections:          Bacterial → acute pyogenic meningitis, abscesses, etc.      Viral → meningitis, encephalitis, etc.      Fungal      Protozoal.        Of these, bacterial meningitis is the most important to recognize clinically.  Objective      Given a history and physical examination, students should be able to make a diagnosis of the type of CNS infection present in the patient.  Features of Meningitis in Adults  Fever, headache, altered mental status, photophobia.  Resisting neck flexion (stretches the meninges, causes pain).  Other signs of Meningitis (related to stretching of the meninges):          Kernig’s Sign → straight leg raise causes pain/discomfort of the neck. (mnemonic: K = knees).      Brudzinski’s Sign → neck flexion causes the patient to flex their hips.      These signs are less reliable in comatose or young patients.        Meningococcal rash (purpuric rash) → suggests septicemia and is pathognomonic of Neisseria Meningitides.Features of Meningitis in Infants &amp; Newborns  Fever, irritability and poor feeding.  Drowsiness.  Vomiting, convulsions.  Bulging fontanelle (late sign).  Meningococcal Rash.  Objective      When presented with the results of a CSF examination, the student should determine the type of meningitis afflicting the patient and the most common offending organisms.  Causes of Meningitis  Most common causes in children &amp; adults:          Strep. pneumoniae      Neisseria Meningitidis        Most common causes in neonates          E. coli      Strep. agalactiae (GBS)        Haemophilus influenzae used to be a common cause as well, but is now almost non-existent due to vaccination against it.  Listeria monocytogenes is also possible if the patient has other comorbidities:          Immunocompromised.      Elderly, alcoholic, DM.        S. aureus is also possible if recent head trauma/neurosurgical procedure (S. aureus is commonly found in the skin, so it can transmit via an open wound).  Objective      When asked, students should be able to outline a plan for managing suspected meningitis in the presence of altered sensorium and/or focal neurological findings.  Management of Meningitis  Tests that can be done for meningitis:          Blood culture → positive in 50% of patients with meningitis, because it often spreads via hematogenous spread.      Lumbar puncture → used to nail a diagnosis; ask for the following tests to be done on the LP: This is pretty similar to what you ask for with a joint aspiration with a suspected septic joint (recall, 3C’s and a G). Here, instead of asking for crystals, you ask for Protein + Glucose                  Gram Stain.          Culture &amp; Sensitivity          WBC Count + Differential          Protein &amp; Glucose.                      WARNING: Never perform a lumbar puncture on a patient that:          Is stuperous/comatose.      Has focal neurological deficits.        This is because these patients might have a space filling lesion, and a LP could result in cerebral herniation or DEATH:          Removal of CSF takes away some of the ‘padding’ around the brain; with less CSF keeping it afloat, it can sag.      If the brain already has a space filling lesion, then loss of this CSF could then result in herniation → bad!        Remember      NEVER perform a LP on a patient that is:              Stuperous/comatose.        Has focal neurologic deficits.              General Management Approach:          Perform blood cultures and start empiric antibiotics      Check for CNS focal signs or decreased LOC:                  If absent, do a lumbar puncture.          If present, an LP is contraindicated, so a CT scan should be done to r/o a mass lesion.                          If a CT doesn’t show a mass lesion, proceed with an LP.              If a CT does show a mass lesion, refer to neurosurgery.                                          With the results of the LP, you can then tailor your empiric antibiotics to the causative organism.      Approach to a Lumbar Puncture  As mentioned in MSK;   Objective      When presented with the results of a CSF examination, the student should determine the type of meningitis afflicting the patient and the most common offending organisms.  Spinous processes go a bit down, so you aim a little up.Dura is tough, so you feel a bit of a pop.Can check CSF levels in glass manometer; which directly reflects ICP; normally 10-20 cm of CSF; &gt; 20 suggests increased ICP.Decreased glucose pumped into CSF; glu down (not as much because bacteria eats it up).put table here.  Objective      Students should be able to write an antibiotic order for the empiric treatment of meningitis in the adult.  Adults: a) Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q4h (3rd Generation Cephalosporin)b) Vancomycin 2 g IV q12hVancomycin is a backup b/c a fair amount of pneuomococci can be resistant to ceftriaxone.Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin are also used empirically in infants and newborns, but in dosages based on weight.Inflammation can cause complications, so steroids can also be used acutely.Early treatment with dexamethasone: 10 mg IV with first dose of antibiotic and every 6 hours for four days• Significant reduction in morbidity and mortalityEspecially inflammation of 8th nerve -&gt; deafness.SystemicComplications–Hyponatremia, septic shock, adrenal insufficiency2) Meningealinflammationproducingcranial nerve palsies (especially CN 8 –sensorineural deafness) – more on this in Dr. Parnes’ sensorineural hearing loss lecture3) Meningealfibrosisandaqueductalstenosis – hydrocephalus (CSF pressure build up)Inflammation of blood vesselsInflammation of nerves (CN 8 most common for some reason).Meningeal fibrosis and aqueductal stenosis can result in reduced CSF exiting= hydrocephalus (both communicating or non-communicating); CSF pressure buildup.Secondaryvasculitis(inflammationof vessels) of both veins and arteries – infarction of brain tissue5) Cerebritis (inflammation of brain), abscess, and infarctions can all produce seizures6) Cerebraloedemacanresultinbrain herniation and deathBrain Abscess (a localized collection of puss buried in the brain)• May be due to a contiguous source of infection from the middle ear, mastoids, penetrating wound , but can also be hematogenous.Clinical Presentation: Headache, seizures, altered sensorium, and focal neurological deficitsCommon organisms: anaerobes, enterobacterial, streptococcus, and staphylococcusTreatment: Surgery plus antibioticsSame presentation; but since a focal lesion, can have focal findings.Example of a basilar skull fracture allowing bacterial organisms into the brain.Occipital lesion; L homonymous hemianopia.Acute frontal sinusitus -&gt; subdural empyema.

	{"title": "Clinical Neurology Small Group II", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary  Juan is a 37 year‐old right‐handed man who presents to the neurology clinic after a series of unusual spells. He describes that suddenly he starts feeling nauseous, with a sensation of deja‐vu, and sometimes a feeling in his abdomen that rises up to his throat. Then he wakes up on the ground confused and is unable to communicate well with others. His roommate had witnessed 2 of these events and is able to describe that Juan looks pale, is unresponsive, and has prominent lip smacking and chewing movements. He also described repetitive movements of his left hand picking at his clothes. In one of those events, his roommate saw that Juan had a twisting movement of his right arm followed by turning of the head to the right and then jerking movements of his limbs. On that particular occasion, Juan lost control of his bladder.  He has had a total of 8 events over the last 4 months. Each event lasted approximately 40‐50 seconds, with the exception of one lasting 1 minute (the second one described by his roommate).  Juan’s past medical history is remarkable for a single simple febrile seizure at the age of 3, in the context of an episode of otitis media. His family history otherwise is unremarkable.  Juan’s neurological exam was normal.   What is the differential diagnosis of Juan’s spells?  What type of seizures is Juan experiencing? → 3 different types.          Several simple partial seizures.                  These are seen in his sudden spells of nausea + deja vu.          More specifically, these are auras; a sensory-specific subgroup of simple partial seizures.          Where you have a sensation rising from your abdomen to your throat, this is called an epigastric aura.                    Complex partial seizures                  Where he had a loss of consciousness, but his findings still seemed confined to one side (unilateral motor phenomena).          Unilateral motor phenomena include ‘twisting motions of his right arm’, and ‘turning of head to the right’.                      What is the localization of these seizures within the nervous system?          Key points to focus on:                  Possible post-ictal Wernicke’s aphasia.          Deja vu = meso-temporal lobe.          Repetitive motions of his left hand.          Twisting motion of his right arm.          Turning of the head to the right.                    These are suggestive of a L-sided temporal lobe problem, particularly the deeper regions.      Wernicke’s area is most commonly located on the L temporal lobe, but can often not help lateralization because the seizure can travel to the other side.      Earlier findings are better for localization, before it spreads.        Does he have epilepsy?          Epilepsy = &gt;2 unprovoked seizures.      So this is a L temporal lobe epilepsy.        What are the possible etiologies for his seizures?          UGHH.      Early febrile seizures = risk factor for future epileptic seizures.      Most likely etiology; mesial temporal lobe sclerosis.      Second most likely; tumours.        What test would you order next? And subsequently?          EEG to confirm the diagnosis.      MRI to determine if there is an anatomic cause (eg. sclerosis or tumour).      EEG for diagnosis and to aid localization.      MRI for etiology.      EEG -&gt; L temporal spikes.      MRI -&gt; left mesial temporal sclerosis (TECHNICALLY this is a histopathological diagnosis, but MRI features highly suggestive).        Discuss the test results and management of his seizures          Medical treatment first -&gt; reversible.                  Lots are suitable for focal seizures; but there are some that work better or only for generalized seizures, and vice versa.          Carbamazepine -&gt; can WORSEN classic absence seizures, and actually provoke them.          Valproic acid.                    Surgery -&gt; irreversible.                  No clear indications for surgery; really depends on the patient’s values.          Failure to respond to a few anti-epileptic drugs.          Significant functional issues.          2 failures of monotherapy or combination? Pharmaco-refractive after 2 anti-epileptic drugs.          Temporal lobe epilepsy are generally very refractory to medications; having surgery too late can lead to worsening of neurologic f(x) due to damage caused by epilepsy.                    Case #2  Case Summary  History of Present Illness  Ming, a 60 year old right-handed administrative assistant presents to the emergency room at 1000 hrs with the sudden onset of inability to speak and clumsiness of his right hand. He had been well on rising at 0700 hrs. His symptoms began abruptly on returning from the bathroom at 0730 hrs. There had been some improvement over the next several hours, but when his partner Jack called home at 9:15 hrs, he noted that Ming’s speech was halting and limited – he called 911 immediately. Jack noted that Ming had been experiencing intermittent palpitations lately but no chest pain, shortness of breath or fainting.  Past Medical History: A two year history of mild essential hypertension. Medications: Hydrochlorothiazide. NKDA  Physical Examination  Ming was alert and rubbing the left side of his head. BP was 165/90 and the pulse 110 beats per min irregularly irregular. Afebrile. No carotid bruits. Chest was clear. Heart sounds were normal to ausculation without murmurs. Good peripheral pulses. The abdomen soft and benign. No cutaneous lesions were seen.  Ming was able to follow simple commands and appeared to comprehend conversational speech but his responses were effortful and limited to one-word answers. He appeared frustrated. He was unable to read aloud and could only write his name. On cranial nerve examination, his visual fields were full to threat. His pupils were equal and briskly reactive to light. He had full extraocular movements without nystagmus. He reacted to pinprick bilaterally. He had a mild right lower facial droop. His palate was midline and the tongue deviates slightly to the right. His muscle bulk was normal. He had reduced tone on the right. There was a right pronator drift. Strength testing was full on the left with very mild weakness of right shoulder abduction, elbow extension and finger extension. Right hand rapid alternating movements were slow. Lower extremity power was full bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes were present, perhaps slightly reduced in the right arm. The right toe was extensor and the left was flexor.  Distinguish between fluent and nonfluent aphasia.          Fluent aphasia → the patient will be able to speak, but will be nonsensical.                  Wernicke’s aphasia is a classic example, where the speech generating region of the brain is okay, but the speech recognition area is affected. Here, the patient is mechanically able to speak, but what they say won’t make sense.                    Nonfluent aphasia → the patient is unable to speak.                  Broca’s aphasia is a classic example, where the speech generating region of the brain is affected, but the speech recognition area is okay. Here, the patient will be able to understand commands, but will be unable to verbalize.                      Define pronator drift.          Pronator Drift → a finding where, when you put your hands out in front of you in supination, and close your eyes, one arm will drift down with pronation.      A positive finding suggests upper motor neuron problems, and is useful in patients where there is no apparent muscle weakness. Pronator drift will reveal more subtle situations where the short lasting phasic innervation is preserved, but the tonic innervation is affected.        Localize the lesion and discuss why.          L frontal lobe, around Broca’s area.        Discuss the differential diagnosis.          Stroke -&gt; ischemic or hemorrhagic.      Post-ictal stroke during sleep?      Migraines (unlikely since no previous history).        Discuss the presumed etiology of his clinical presentation.          Most likely to be a stroke; MCA      A-fib, increases risk of VTE, ischemic stroke.        Discuss the immediate management of this patient.          CT/MRI to DDx ischemic or hemorrhagic.      If ischemic, immediate tPA; within 4.5 hours of onset.      If hemorrhagic, stabilize vitals &amp; supportive Tx. BP control. No specific pharmacologic Tx; don’t administer pro-thrombotic factors; 2 studies haven’t shown improved clinical outcomes.      NEVER PRESCRIBE ANTI-THROMBOTIC DRUGS (even Aspirin) WITHOUT BRAIN IMAGING!!        Outline an approach to the investigation of this patient.          EKG -&gt; determine if A-fib, since suspicious P/E findings      Echocardiogram; look for anatomic causes of A-fib. CAD is common cause of A-fib.

Etiology:          Young → MVA.      Old → falls.        Mortality:  There is a worse mortality with a subdural hematoma because patients with subdural hematomas often have more severe comorbidities.          Epidural hematoma → 10-25%.      Subdural hematoma → 45-70%.      The Glasgow Coma Scale  Objective      Explain the components of the Glasgow Coma Scale.    Glasgow Coma Scale → an easy to determine, objective, reproducible, and predictive scoring algorithm to determine a patient’s level of consciousness.          There are 3 sections, and you get 1 point in each section just for showing up; hence, the lowest score you can get is 3.      The maximum possible score that you can get is 15.        The GCS is assessed as follows:          Eye Opening:                  Spontaneously → 4.          To speech → 3.          To pain → 2.          None → 1.

	{"title": "Approach to Stroke", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define stroke and TIA.  Discuss the classification of stroke.  List the common causes of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.  Describe the clinical presentation of stroke by the vascular territory involved.  List common modifiable and non-modifiable stroke risk factors.  Outline an approach to primary and secondary stroke prevention.  Discuss the importance of educating the public that acute stroke is an emergency.  Objective      Define stroke and TIA.    Stroke → sudden onset of neurologic deficit caused by a problem with the blood supply to the brain.  Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) → a brief episode of reversible neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than one hour, and without evidence of acute infarction.          Infarction → tissue death due to a lack of oxygen.      Penumbra → ‘stunned’ but still viable brain tissue surrounding an ischemic core (infarction).        A TIA has reversible effects, a stroke has irreversible effects!  Objective      Discuss the classification of stroke.    Types of stroke:          Ischemic stroke → occlusion of blood supply (not enough blood).                  Large vessel occlusion → eg. MCA, ACA, PCA, etc. A Lacunar stroke is named as such because it results in a small lacuna (empty spaces) as a result of the infarcts.          Small vessel occlusion → ie. a Lacunar stroke.                    Hemorrhagic stroke → rupture of blood vessel causing bleeding into or around the brain (too much blood).        With an ischemic return of circulation may not be able to salvage the infarcted tissue, but it may help the penumbral tissue.  The Ischemic Penumbra            Patent blood vessel shown on top surrounded in blue.      Infarced blood vessel shown below surrounded in red.      In the area normally supplied by both the patent and infarcted vessel, is the penumbra.      Because this tissue still has circulation, it hasn’t died yet. However, since it only has partial circulation, there’s still neurological dysfunction.        Objective      List the common causes of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.  Causes of Ischemic Stroke  Artery to artery spread of a clot:          Carotid embolic (from carotid).      Intracranial stenosis.      Aorta embolic (from aorta).        Cardioembolic (from heart):          Either due to a clot forming on a valve (recall that mechanical valves are especially prone to this), or due to atrial fibrillation.        Lacunar/small vessel → described above.  Artery Dissection → a tiny tear through part of artery, where blood seeps into the layer between. This can cause a stroke in two ways:          Disruption to the internal structure of the artery is irritating, and can lead to a clot.      With enough bleeding into the intermediate layer, there can be occlusion.        Cerebral Hypoperfusion          Causes watershed infarcts (where the area that’s most predisposed to damage is the area between two vascular territories; the ‘watershed zone’, same concept as the ‘penumbra’).        Cryotogenic → no identified cause.Causes of Hemorrhagic Stroke  Hypertensive anteriopathy → very likely if the hemorrhage is deep (pons, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum).  Congophilic angiopathy → also called amyloid angiopathy.          This is more likely if you see hemorrhages in the lobes of the brain, just beneath the cortex (in the white matter).      Here, there’s amyloid deposition in the walls of the blood vessel, which weakens them and predisposes them for rupture.        Tumour → usually due to metastasis, rather than a primary tumour.  Vascular malformations  Coagulopathy.  Remember      If a hemorrhage is deep, then suspect hypertensive arteriopathy.    If a hemorrhage is lobar, then suspect congophilic angiopathy.  Causes of Acute WeaknessIt’s important to go over the causes of acute weakness, which may not always be due to a stroke. Migraines, Todd’s paresis (focal weakness after a focal seizure), and psychogenic causes are all possible:  Ischemic stroke:          Must r/o quickly for tPA.      Always follows a specific vascular territory (eg. ACA, MCA, PCA).        Intracerebral hemorrhage:          May not follow vascular territories (may cross b/w ACA and PCA for example).      More often associated with headaches due to increase in ICP.        Migraine:          Often occipital, which results in loss of vision in one hemifield.      Some patients may also have hemiplegia as well.      Some features that differentiate a hemiplegic migraine from a stroke, is that (1) the weakness often ‘marches’ (a slow onset and offset), (2) it’s often in young females, and (3), the duration is much shorter (minutes, rarely hours).      Migraines cause a ‘spreading depression’ of cortical activity; contrast this with a seizure, which causes ‘spreading excitation’ of cortical activity.        Todd’s paresis: Because Todd’s paresis is a focal weakness after a seizure, you will never have a Todd’s paresis with a primary generalized seizure.          Todd’s paresis is the focal deficit you have after a focal seizure (due to fatigue of the overexcited area).        Psychogenic:           Psychogenic causes include malingering (faking it), or a conversion disorder:                  Malingering → patient is faking it.          Conversion disorder → patient is unaware that they’re doing it, but it’s still psychogenic; often due to a repression of previous psychological trauma.                    Inconsistent findings of weakness, especially if distracted (in other words, if you distract them and test their power, it will increase).      Weakness does not follow typical vascular territories.        Objective      Describe the clinical presentation of stroke by the vascular territory involved.    Findings with an MCA, ACA, PCA, and basilar infarct should be review.  Lacunar syndromes are a little more interesting, because they involve a very tiny infarct that produces a correspondingly focal neurologic deficit.          If the infarct is cortical, then it probably won’t have much of a clinical presentation.      However, if it affects the white matter, where information converges, than you may have some significant specific findings.      Examples of possible findings:                  Clumsy hand dysarthria.          Pure motor (face/arm/leg equally affected; usually due to corona radiata stroke).          Pure sensory           Ataxic hemiparesis.          Sensorimotor.                      Objective      List common modifiable and non-modifiable stroke risk factors.    Modifiable Risk Factors:          Hypertension → most important.      Diabetes (control) → second most important.      Elevated cholesterol.      Smoking.      Atrial fibrillation.      Heart Disease.      Sedentary lifestyle.      Obesity.      Cocaine or amphetamine use.      Post-partum.      Bleeding disorders/anticoagulant use.        Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:          Age.      Gender.      Ethnicity.      Family History.        Objective      Outline an approach to primary and secondary stroke prevention.    Primary Stroke Prevention → preventing strokes from ever occurring.          Reduce all modifiable risk factors → especially hypertension and poorly controlled diabetes.      Consider low dose ASA in patients with multiple risk factors.      Start anticoagulation if patient has atrial fibrillation and a high CHADS2:                  Recall that the CHADS2 score was:                          Congestive Heart Failure              Hypertension              Age &gt; 75              Diabetes              Prior stroke                                All risk factors give 1 point, except a prior stroke, which gives 2.                          If CHADS2 = 0, no anticoagulation is given.               If CHADS2 = 1, antiplatelets or anticoagulation are used.              If CHADS2 &gt; 1, anticoagulation is given.                                            Secondary Stroke Prevention → preventing future strokes after the first one.          Antiplatelet or anticoagulation → depends on the cause of the stroke:                  If cardioembolic (atrial fibrillation, significant valve disease) → use anticoagulation (eg. warfarin).          All other causes → use antiplatelet (low dose ASA for most; clopidigrel second line; combined ASA + clopidigrel if high risk).                    Other medical management → very intuitive:                  BP control (&lt;140/90) if hypertensive.          Glucose control if diabetic.          Lipid management.          Physical activity counselling.          Nutrition counselling/obesity management.          Smoking cessation counselling.                    Carotid endarterectomy/stenting:                  Done if significant carotid stenosis is found ipsilateral to the stroke site (ie. it’s presumed to be carotid embolic).          Used to open up the carotid artery to improve flow.          Not recommended for asymptomatic stenosis.                      Objective      Discuss the importance of educating the public that acute stroke is an emergency.    TIME IS BRAIN.  The faster you get the patient treated, the better the outcomes.  Also, with an ischemic stroke, thrombolysis can only be done within the first 4.5 hours (this window may be subject to change in the future).Management of StrokeIschemic Stroke Management  CT head to r/o bleed.          The first CT head is used to determine whether there’s an ICH, which would rule out thrombolysis (you don’t want to clot bust when there’s an acute bleed into the brain).        If no bleed, CTA to look for a clot in proximal cerebral artery (ICA/MCA/Basilar).          The second CT angiogram is used to identify where the clot is.        If no tPA contraindications, give tPA.          tPA has to be given within 4.5 hours of the onset of the stroke.      Giving tPA too late runs the risk of causing an ICH because the blood vessels become very leaky with prolonged loss of perfusion.      Contraindications for tPA include (don’t memorize):                  Evidence of ICH on CT or a history of ICH.          Significant early ischemic changes seen on CT (too much tissue is already dead). Defined as more than 1/3 of the MCA territory already being involved.          Symptoms suggestive of a SAH, or a seizure on onset.          BP &gt; 185/110 AFTER attempts to reduce it.          Stroke or serious head trauma &lt; 3 months.          Major surgery &lt; 14 days, or GI/GU bleed &lt; 21 days.          Arterial puncture at non-compressible site &lt; 7d (or LP)          Poor coagulation → low Plt (&lt;100,000), INR (&gt; 1.4), PTT (&gt;40 sec).          Glucose &lt; 3 or &gt; 22.          Relatively contraindicated if pregnant, pericarditis, or endocarditis.                      Consider clot retrieval.  If tPA is contraindicated and clot retrieval is not an option:          Allow for increases in BP for up to 48 hours to help perfuse the penumbral tissue and preserve brain tissue (up to around 210/120 ish).      Hemorrhagic Stroke Management  BP control acutely:          Have BP &lt;160/110 (some studies are suggesting &lt;140/90).      Lowered BP slows the hemorrhage.        Hold all antiplatelets/anticoagulation acutely:          Since you stop all anticoagulation and antiplatelets, and the patient isn’t moving much, they’re now actually at a risk for a DVT.      So in this case, you’d give DVT prophylaxis, but it can’t be anticoagulation/antiplatelets!.      What’s used instead are mechanical devices acutely (which segmentally constrict to manually pump blood).      After 24 hours, repeat the CT head, and if there’s no clot extension, then you can start LMWH.        Investigate causes of ICH (MRI, CTA)  Very rarely is there a role for neurosurgical intervention.          Only if the clot is causing significant increases in the intracranial pressure and the clot is accessible.

	{"title": "Vertigo", "text": "Dizziness = layterm, encompasses vertigo, ataxia, lightheadedness, etc.Vertigo = illusion of movementLecture Objectives  Understand pathologic and physiology nystagmus.  Signs and symptoms of vestibular disorders.  Approach to ‘dizziness’.  Treatments for peripheral vertigo.  Describe BPPV, Menieres Disease, labyrinthitis, ototoxicity.Vestibular Physiology  The vestibular system takes 3 inputs:          Visual.      Vestibular.      Proprioceptive.        Processing then occurs in the cerebellum.  Output is to the extraocular muscles and flexors/extensors.  The vestibular system functions as ‘image stabilization’; it helps us keep the world seem balanced.Canal Orientation  Posterior canal on both sides is on the same plane as superior canal on other side?  So posterior canal on one side works with superior canal on other side.  Will be important later on for BPPV.  PARALLEL.  Base cilia?  Stereocilia?  Towards condrocilium = stimulation? Away = inhibition?Inside canal, direct fluid away from canal (ampullofugal canal) stimulates it?!Two canals work at same time; one is stimulated, one is inhibited; difference is what drives the VOR.  Nystagmus → a rhythmic back and forth movement of the eyes with a quick phase and a slow phase.          The direction of the nystagmus after the fast phase.      If you put cold or hot water in the ear, it actually generates a nystagmus (hot water = depolarization, cold water = hyperpolarization/inhibition).                  Horizontal canal closest to ear drum; so it’s what affected, in horizontal plane.                    So hot water on R side will increase ‘strength’ on R side vs L, drifts R-&gt;L, and then snaps back.      Since nystagmus named after FAST part, this is a R nystagmus.        Similarly, cold in L; R pushes harder, will drift left, then snap back.          Each eye tries to ‘push’ eye in opposite direction.

MOST USEFUL.Really short (seconds); almost always BPPV.Minutes - hours; Menieres disease most common.Hours-days = labyrinthitisMigranous vertigo; associated with migraines.Labyrinthitis vs Vetibular neuronitis?ENT:Labyrinthitis = whole labyrinth.Vestibular neuronitis = isolated to vestibular labyrinth!?!Physical ExamFull H&amp;N Exam.Tuning ForksCranial NervesCerebellar TestingDix-Hallpike.Pt. presents with vertigo; what’s the first thing you want to r/o?- Stroke, etc. The really bad stuff.- ASK ABOUT THE 5 D’s:	- Dysarthria.	- Dysphagia.	- Dysmetria (appendicular ataxia)	- Diplopi	- Downbeating and/or direction changing nystagmus.- Any of these suggest a non-vestibular cause, and should warrant more serious investigations (CT, neuro work up).BPPV = Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo- Need to know this; MOST COMMON CAUSE OF EAR VERTIGO.- Very common; will see in family practice, ER, etc.- KNOW THIS; IF YOU DON’T, YOUR CLASSMATES WILL.	- Most common vestibular end-organ disorder.	- Spinning for 30 seconds at a time, but it happens all the time.		- Make sure you tease out this Hx.	- Brief vertgo episodes (10-30 sec), induced by SPECIFIC head movements (eg. roll to right vs left).	- When severe, motion sensitivity.- ETIOLOGY:	- 50-70% = idiopathic (degenerative).	- Head trauma (includes iatrogenic)		- Common cause of synchronous BILATERAL BPPV.	- Vestibular neuronitis	- Migraine	- Meniere’s disease; you can have one WITH the other.	- Other.- PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:	- Free-floating endolymph particles, almost always in posterior semicircular canal.	- Why almost always the posterior one?		- You have crystals in labyrinth all the time, attached to these little hairs. In utricle!?!?		- Lets say they go into horitontal canal; canal is tilted upwards, so will be pushed down.		- What about superior canal, has to go all the way up; very hard.		- Posterior canal = easier to get in, easy to fall all the way into the nadir of the vestibular system, difficult to get out.- DIAGNOSIS:	- Dix-Hallpike Maneuver	- Turn head 45 degrees in direction you want to Tx	- Doesn’t test both ears at same time.	- Lay head over edge of bed, will see classic nystagmus.	- Since posterior and superior canal are involved in rotatory nystagmus!!		- Will see rotatory nystagmus		- 5 things you see in Dix-Hallpike			1. Nothing at first (latency due to crystals moving into position)			2. Rotatory nystagmus (‘superior pole beating towards the ground’; hence L = CW, R = CCW)			3. Limited total duration; crystals settle.			4. Direction reversal on sitting (crystals fall back other way to inhibit canal); will get opposite.			5. Fatigue of response over time; crystals disperse, less able to stimulate canal.		- Watch videos of Dix-Hallpike.- TREATMENT:	- Reassurance; not a tumour, not a stroke.	- Habituation exercises in past.	- PARTICLE REPOSITIONING MANEUVER = GOLD STANDARD		- Some ppl call this the Epley maneuver.		- See the video! Really cool; idea is to get crystals out of the canal.			- Visualize in 3D!			- Ideal way to fix this would be to do a reverse somersault; someone actually came up with a fancy ass $$$ expensive machine to do this!!		- 33% recurrence rate over next year. But can learn maneuver on themselves.			- 80% treatable in single treatment session.			- 95% treatable in 3 sessions.	- Surgery in rare cases.		- Dr. Parnes who gave yesterday’s lecture invented this!Dizzyfix; only way to get ball through contraption is to do the Epley maneuver.Also an app for that.Same guy who made the hat made the app!BPPV SUMMARY  Most cases of BPPV arise from free-floating posterior canal endolymph particles.  Most can be cured by particle repositioning.  Persistent, recurrent or atypical cases are rare.  For intractable BPPV, posterior semicircular canal occlusion is a safe and effective proceudure.MENIERE’S DISEASEIn ear you have perilymph and endolymph?

Widely prescribed since 1930s.Often some patients feel as if their attacks are precipitated by sodium intake.Unclear mechanism (READ THIS)Diuretics; thought to reduce water load.Betahistine (commonly used in Canada and Europe); SERC.	- Few side effects.	- Thought to be a mild vasodilator that improves microcirculation to ear.	- Cochrane review; half show some benefit, half show no benefit, but since few side effects, given anyway.SIDE EFFECTSSteroids. oral or intratympanic admin.Intratympanic gentamycin -&gt; kill inner ear.Ototoxic, but preferentially kills vestibular system &gt; hearing system. Inject that vs steroids.Problem: must rely on one side vestibular system. Now what if you get Meniere’s on other side? Then you’re fucked. So only do this if you really need this. Very effective (93% get excellent control)Surgical treatment -&gt; SKIP.If nothing else works.Surgical treatment very aggressive.Steroids and gentamycin have largely supplanted this.ENDOLYMPHATIC SAC SURGERY HAS BEEN DISCREDITED; DOESN’T WORK.Vestibular neurectomy; cut vestibular nerve.	Like ‘surgical gentamycin’; done if gentamycin doesn’t work.Everything else fails; labyrinthectomy; VICIOUSLY REMOVE THE ENTIRE INNER EAR!!TREATMENT ALGORITHM.Summary; conservative management can control vertigo in 80% of patients.Intratympanic treatments have largely replaced surgical intervention.Ablative procedures do not ‘cure’ disease.VESTIBULAR NEURONITIS/VIRAL LABYRINTHITISREcent URIVertigo lasting daysNystamug beating away from affected ear.Nausea + vomiting.Labyrinthitis has hearing loss &amp; tinnitus.Treament:	- Symptomatic with antiemetics and vestibular sedatives (short-term).	- Oral steroids if within first 72 h after onset.	- No evidence of anti-virals being efficacious.AMINOGLYCOSIDE TOXICITY.MORE CHRONIC SYMPTOMSEardrops -&gt; typ unialteral.Systemic (IV), can often kill both ears, very bad.

	{"title": "Conductive Hearing Loss", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Diagnose a conductive hearing loss.  Create a differential diagnosis for conductive hearing loss.  Manage common ear disorders like acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion.Types of Hearing Loss  Conductive          Where air conduction &lt; bone conduction.      In other words, sound transmits better through the bone than through the outer and inner ear.      This is caused by any condition that prevents sound from transmitting from the outer ear to the inner ear.        Sensorineural          Where air conduction = bone conduction.      This is where the transmission of sound is okay, but there’s a problem with the inner ear or vestibulocochlear nerve.        Mixed          Partly conductive, partly sensorineural.      Some amount of air and bone conduction loss.      Outer earPinna = auricle.Idea is to funnel sound into the ear canal.Minimal role into sound transmission.Amplifies high frequency sounds.Assists in sound localization.Tympanic membrane.What do you see with an otoscopic exam?Here, you can see the handle of the malleus, as well as additional structures. Head of stapes, facial nerves.Stapedius = protective mechanism, dampens movement of stapes with loud sounds.Tensor tympani, goes to neck of malleus.Stapedius by facial nerve.Tensor tympani = trigeminal nerve.Impedance-Matching of the middle ear.In electronics, impedance matching is the practice of designing the input impedance of an electrical load or the output impedance of its corresponding signal source to maximize the power transfer or minimize signal reflection from the load.Sound vibrations have to move fluid in inner ear, create waves, 99.9% of sound energy reflected from air to fluid medium.P = F/AAugmenting the signal involves both.1. Difference in surface area of eardrum to stapes footplate (20:1)2. Lever action of the ossicles (1.3:1)Hearing assessment.May be as simple as a tuning fork.More precise with audiometer + sound booth (no ambient sound).Audiogram; measure threshold of hearing with both ear and bone conduction.Determine how much hearing loss there is, and what type of hearing loss there is.Decibels WRT to frequency plotted.Decibels = loudness, relative measurement of sound.0 decibels = threshold of hearing in normal ear.Range of human hearing is huge, so log scale.WEBER TESTW in weber, so point = middle, put on middle of head.Middle of head, push hard to get that bone conduction!Localization of sound to one ear suggests:	- Louder in ear with conductive loss.	- Louder away from ear with sensorineural loss.Weber test considerations The Weber test reflects conduction loss in the ipsilateral ear because, in the event of impaired conduction, ipsilateral sensorineural hearing is perceived as louder; this is the same reason humming becomes more salient when covering the ears.RINNE TESTPress firmly on head, so hard that you pull on other side of head.If you press lightly, will get false negative response (since bone conduction is attenuated).Press on hard bone (mastoid bone).Don’t wait until can’t hear, just ask which is louder!!! Waste of time!!!!If 1 (on bone) is louder, then it’s a conductive hearing loss!Low freq affected more than high freq; otosclerosis.Throughout frequencies, atresia of ear!?Surgery to recreate an ear canal is risky, facial nerve is closeby.Bone conductive hearing aid, vibrates bone depending on surrounding sound.BAHA = bone anchored hearing aid, this is anchored to the bone itself, to transmit vibrations through skull.More convenient than older versions, which had to be strapped on.Disorders of the External Auditory Canal:Outer third or inner 2/3s?Outer third, thick skin, adnexa (hair follicles, sebaceous glands, etc), cartilage.Medial 2/3s. = thin skin, no hair, bony, exquisitely sensitive.	- Outer ear doesn’t hurt much, inner ear super sensitive.	- Be mindful of this when doing otoscopic examination.Impacted cerumen (earwax).You need a COMPLETE impaction to have hearing loss.If you have a little space, can hear fine.Oftentimes, will be mostly occluded, and water in ear will fill this out completely.Family docs clean this out with syringe.

Middle ear → amplifies and transmits sounds to the inner ear.      Inner ear → converts sounds into action potentials.      External EarBig floppy thing = auricle (~ear), cartilage.External acoustic (auditory) meatus = ear tube.First third of it is cartilaginous, you can squish it around a bit.The inner 2/3 is bone.Lateral 1/3 = oil + wax glands (ear wax).Normally ear wax should be going out ear, not in to beside tympanic membrane.External ear ends at the tympanic membrane (ear drum).Underneath, styloid process, posteriorly = mastoid process; where sternocleidomastoid attaches.External acoustic meatus, little hole.Cauliflower ear; blood collects between perichondrium and cartilage.Fibrous tissue in overlying skin forms. - Outer bones = periosteum, outer cartilage = perichondrium. - Any damage can injure region between perichondrium and carilage. - Boxing, rugby, etc. - Gotta syringe out ear after injury or you end up with cauliflower ear.Otitis externa = inflammation of outer ear.Often caused by eczema, or fungal/bacterial infection.Described as an earache.Example: Swimmer’s ear.Skin cancer.The ear is susceptible to melanoma; they stick out, and they’re hard to get sunscreen on.Middle EarBetween tympanic membrane and inner ear.Air filled; don’t want fluid in there.Transmits sound from tympanic membrane to ossicles to inner ear.Can’t just transmit, also has to amplify.	- This is because the inner ear is fluid filled, so the sound has to amplify to travel through the inner fluid filled chamber.	- Fluid transmits more poorly through fluid.- Branches of facial and glossopharyngeal nerve pass through.Think of middle ear like a box; roof, floor, 4 walls.Middle ear in TEMPORAL BONE.ROOF = thin portion of temporal bone = tegman tympani.	- Thin bone that separates middle ear from the middle cranial fossa.Lateral Wall = tympanic membrane (ear drum).Anterior Wall = bony canal containing tensor tympani and auditory tube.	- Picture shows it going medial, but it actually goes anterior.	- Auditory tube also known as:		- Eustachian tube.		- Pharyngeotypanic tube.	- Tensor tympani; tenses the tympanic membrane.		- Loud noise causes tensing to dampen sound conduction through the tympanic membrane.- What does the auditory tube do?	- Releases pressure in the middle ear.	- Yawning/chewing gum relaxes the muscle surrounding the eustachian tube.Medial Wall:	- Bone covered with mucous membrane.	- Separates middle ear to inner ear.Floor:	- Thin wall separating tympanic cavity from IJV.Posterior Wall:	- Opening to mastoid antrum.	- LISTEN TO THIS; Aditus?!?!Ossicles = 3 bones1. Malleus = small hammer.2. Incus = anvil3. Stapes = stirrup.Malleus -&gt; Incus -&gt; stapes articulation.Base of stapes fits into oval window that = opening between middle and inner ear.Plugged up with base of stapes.So tympanic membrane moves b/c of sound -&gt; moves tympanic membrane -&gt; moves malleus -&gt; moves incus -&gt; moves stapes -&gt; pushes in and out of oval window into inner ear.This amplifies sound vibrations into inner ear.Lever system between bones amps up frequency ~1.3 x.Tympanic membrane = 17x size of oval window.Hence 1.3x17 = ~25 times amplification.This is necessary to get the inner ear fluid moving.Tiny bones, tiny muscles:Tensor tympani; attaches to malleus (1st in chain, which attaches to membrane); holds back the malleus to dampen sound waves.Stapedius, attaches to the stapes, and dampens wild movements of the stapes before it enters the oval window.It’s thought that these muscles not only dampen, but also help ‘tweak’ input to filter out ambient noise. Jury’s still out.What nerves innervate these muscles?- CN VII for Stapedius.- CN V for tensor tympani.- Malleus and incus innervated by trigeminal nerve.- Stapes by facial nerve.Why? Evolution.Jaw = first arch derivative; nerve to jaw = trigeminal.Ears are derivative from the jaw, (V3).Stapes is derived from lever system (second arch derivative in fish) = facial nerve.Malleus and Incus• Part of jaw• Innervated by CN V3Stapes• Part of structure thatworks on jaw• Innervated by CN VIITherefore:Tensor tympani – CN V3Stapedius – CN VIITympanic MembraneHealthy ear, can see handle of the malleus.Relationships of the middle ear.Connected posteriorly with the mastoid air cells.Anteriorly to pharynx with auditory tube.Consequence: INFECTIONS:	- Middle ear should be an air filled sac.	- Auditory tube normally closed, unless yawn/chewing.	- Hence, an infection easily seals it shut.	- Goes too far posteriorly, can get into mastoid air cells -&gt; mastoiditis.	- Infection of mastoid air cells.Auditory tube connects middle ear to nasopharynx.More horizontal in infants and children than adults.	Hence they’re more susceptible to ear infections.	Also when you sleep on your site; prevents drainage.Tube easily closes; prevents infection from escaping ear.OTITIS MEDIA; you feel like you’re underwater.- Infection of middle ear.- Infected fluid; sounds like you’re underwater.- Tympanic membrane = red and inflammed.- Tympanic membrane is the weakest part; escape for pressure.	- Can see bubbles, redness, inflammation on tympanic membrane.	- Can burst tympanic membrane; relief (pressure drains), can’t hear well for a few days.	- If this is a chronic problem (tubes put in ears), allows for drainage.	- Problem with tubes: hole, so when swimming, fluid can get into inner ear (hence you need earplugs).Facial nerve pathway:Crazy path through this region:Internal acoustic meatus -&gt; facial canal	Both sides = mastoid.	Goes medial to middle ear (between middle and inner ear), and then it goes posteriorly.	(RELATIONS OF MIDDLE EAR IMAGE): looking into medial wall; past which will go into inner ear. Then curves around to go posterior to middle ear.	So actual nerve loops around medial and posterior.Carries on, gives off some branches, goes through stylomastoid foramen; terminal branches of facial nerve.	Terminal branches mostly motor, innervate muscles of facial expression.	Not chewing muscles (trigeminal).	Go through parotid; 5 branches: (To zanzibar by motor car).

	{"title": "Approach to Level of Consciousness", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define consciousness and recognize the components of consciousness.  Relate components of consciousness to neuroanatomical structures.  Identify causes of coma and discuss an approach to the unconscious patient.  Review the neurologic exam for coma.  Discuss other special cases of impaired consciousness.  Objective      Define consciousness and recognize the components of consciousness.  Introduction to Consciousness  Consciousness → “the state of full awareness of the self and one’s relationship to the environment”.  Consciousness can be broken down into two conceptual components: (1) alertness, and (2) awareness.          Alertness reflects degree of arousal.                  Wakefulness and vigilance.          Responsiveness to sensory stimuli.                    Awareness reflects understanding of content.                  The things we do on a day to day basis.          The sum of all functions mediated at a cerebral cortical level.          Includes cognitive processes such as sensation/perception, attention, memory, executive function, and motivation.                      You can think of alertness and awareness as the volume dial and tuning dial of a radio:          Alertness = volume dial → how clearly do you want to hear the content?      Awareness = tuning dial → what content do you want to listen to?      You can be fully alert, but unaware. The analogy here is that your volume is high enough, but you’re tuned to the wrong channel’, and all you’re hearing is ‘static’.      In an unconscious patient, they are neither alert nor aware (eg. both dials are turned off).      Both a sleeping patient and a comatose patient are considered unconscious; the difference is that a comatose patient cannot be roused from their state.        Objective      Relate components of consciousness to neuroanatomical structures.    Key players in the neuroanatomical maintenence of alertness &amp; awareness:            Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)                  A loose (hence reticular) network of cells that run up and down the brainstem, namely the upper pons and midbrain. The ARAS has Central Pattern Generators, which have been extensively explored in a variety of other animal systems, and are pretty neat!          The ARAS is split into two functional components, a caudal component, and a rostral component. We’ll be focusing mainly on the rostral component, which plays a role in LOC.                          The more caudal (lower) component of the ARAS plays a role in movement and walking; we won’t be talking about this here.              The more rostral (upper) component of the ARAS plays a role in alertness.                                 The ARAS projects widely to the cerebral cortex through 2 pathways:                          Via the thalamus.              Via the hypothalamus and basal forebrain.                                          Thalamus → 2 layers are involved in conveying alertness info to the cortex:                  Thalamic reticular nucleus → a thin layer that surrounds the thalamus.          Intralaminar nucleus → another thin layer that runs through the thalamus.                     Cerebral cortex:                  Receives information from the ARAS via the two regions of the thalamus described above.           Governs awareness.                      Key Players in Maintaning Consciousness      Ascending Reticular Activating System (upper pons + midbrain).              Projects to the cerebral cortex via the (1) thalamus and (2) hypothalamus + basal forebrain              Thalamus → two specific layers:              Thalamic reticular nucleus → thin layer surrounding the thalamus.        Intralaminar nucleus → thin layer running through the thalamus.              Cerebral Cortex.    Objective      Identify causes of coma and discuss an approach to the unconscious patient.  Causes of Coma  Coma → a loss of consciousness from which you cannot be roused.  A coma can be caused by damage to any of the regions described above:          Global cortical dysfunction (anything that can knock out the cortex all at once):                  Metabolic, toxic.          Hypoxic-ischemic injury.          Large bilateral destructive lesions.          Trauma.                    Bi-thalamic or hypothalamic dysfunction                  Stroke (eg. basilar thrombosis, which was discussed yesterday, in Localization Cases).          Destructive lesions (eg. hemorrhage, tumours, etc).                    Brainstem (reticular) dysfunction (recall that the ARAS is above the mid-pons): Herniation syndromes can cause a coma because they can squish the midbrain and pons through the foramen magnum, affecting the ARAS.                  Trauma.          Stroke.          Herniation syndromes.                      What are the TREATABLE causes of coma?:          Shock / hypotension.      Hypertensive encephalopathy.      Hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.      Drug intoxication.      Bacterial or fungal meningitis.      Herpes simplex encephalitis (emphasized in a future lecture on CNS Infections).      Brain abscess.      Epidural or subdural hematoma.      Approach to the Unconscious Patient  Make sure that the patient is comatose.          This may seem obvious, but there are some mimics of a coma.      Mimics include locked-in syndrome, severe neuromuscular disease (eg. severe GBS or myasthenia gravis), etc.      In these cases, the patient may be alert and aware, but is unable to communicate that fact.        History → if the patient is unconscious, find someone who knows them and ask these questions.          OPQRST, recent trauma, fever, recent neurological findings.      Exposure or access to toxins or drugs.      Similar episodes in past.      Since you can’t get this directly from the patient, it’s important to get a collateral history as well (include the EMS report)!        General Physical Exam:          ABCs as usual.      Trauma, recent injury.      Neck assessment (ensure no concern for C-spine injury).      Dermatologic assessment → look for signs of chronic disease (eg. cirrhosis), acute processes (eg. endocarditis), or drug/toxin injetion (needle marks, breath odour).        Neurological Exam:          Determine Glasgow Coma Scale (will be seen later).      For the comatose patient, you particularly want to focus on the cranial nerve reflexes:                  Pupillary light reflex.          Vestibulo-ocular reflex.          Corneal Reflex.          Gag reflex.                    You also want to look at EOM function (CN III).        Objective      Review the neurologic exam for coma.  Key Features on Cranial Nerve ExaminationPupillary Light Reflex  Recall that pupil dilation is determined by a balance between sympathetic (dilatory) and parasympathetic (constricting) systems.  The pupillary light reflex assesses the patient’s direct or consensual pupil response to light.          Input → CN II.      Output → CN III.            The pathway     Anhydrosis can help localize; comes off of second order neuron, not third order neuron.      So damage to third order neuron will have miosis and ptosis only; no anhydrosis.    How can you tell at the bedside whether a patient is conscious or unconscious?          Why does it matter?      COWS = cold opposite, warm same; doesn’t apply to comatose patients.In comatose patients, you don’t get nystagmus, only get change in direction of eye.Here, tonic change in direction of eye is in direction of cold stimulus.If Pt. has nystagmus with this, not truly comatose.Gag/cough usually one of the last reflexes to go; good one to check.Decerebrate worse than decorticate, typically suggests that the lesion is lowerAlthough there are many exceptions, in humans as well as animals, flexor (decorticate) posturing tends to occur with lesions higher in the neuraxis, at the midbrain or above,Decerebrate is lower brainstem.. (Mnemonic: in decorticate posturing the lesion is higher, and flexed arms point up toward the cortex; in decerebrate posturing the lesion is lower, and extended arms point down.)GLASGOW COMA SCALE.  Objective      Discuss other special cases of impaired consciousness.    DELIRIUM = fluctuating consciousness (like dials going back and forth).  Persistent vegetative state = disconnection between alertness and awareness.          Patient is fully alert and awake, but is not aware.      Can’t interact with environment.      Usually a progression from prolonged coma.        Intermittent wakefulness, can even have sleep wake cycles.‐ Sleep‐wake cycles with eyes closed then open‐ Breathe spontaneously‐ Blink and show roving eye movements‐ Nystagmus‐ Utter sounds but no words‐ Brief, unsustained visual pursuit‐ Grimace to pain, make facial expressions‐ Yawn, make chewing jaw movements‐ Swallow saliva‐ Move limbs non‐purposefully, arch back; decorticate posturing‐ Flexion withdrawal from noxious stimuli‐ Move head or eyes briefly toward sound or movement‐ Auditory startle‐ Startle myoclonus‐ Sleep‐related erectionsMinimally Conscious StateSomewhat better than persistent vegetative state.GLOBAL impaired consciousness.Limited but discernible evidence of awareness of self and the environment:‐ Following simple commands‐ Gestural or verbal responses to yes/no questions‐ Intelligible verbalisation‐ Purposeful behaviour: movement relevant to environmental stimuli and are not simply reflexive movementsBrain Death = irreversible loss of alertness and awareness.- Endpoint on consciousness scale: awake → asleep → coma → brain death.- Brain death = legal death.‐ Established etiology capable of causing neurological death in the absence of reversible conditions capable of mimicking neurological death‐ Deep unresponsive coma with bilateral absence of motor responses, excluding spinal reflexes‐ Absent brainstem reflexes as defined by absent gag and cough reflexes and the bilateral absence of:‐ Corneal responses‐ Pupillary responses to light, with pupils at mid‐size or greater‐ Vestibulo‐ocular responses‐ Absent respiratory effort based on the apnea test‐ Absent confounding factorsAbsent respiratory effort, apnea test (drive up CO2, stimulate breathing, stop oxygen and mechanical ventilation, see if pt breathes.)MUST CORRECT ABOVE.‐ Confounding factors ‐ Unresuscitatedshock‐ Hypothermia(coretemp.&lt;34C)‐ Severemetabolicdisorderscapableofcausinga potentially reversible coma‐ Severemetabolicabnormalities,includingglucose, electrolytes (incl. phosphate, calcium and magnesium), inborn errors of metabolism, and liver and renal dysfunction‐ Peripheralnerveormuscledysfunctionor neuromuscular blockade‐ Clinicallysignificantdrugintoxications", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/04/02/approach-level-consciousness.html"},

Exam demonstrates:              No verbal output, but can follow commands.        Right facial droop.        Full visual fields.        Severe right arm weakness (not antigravity).        Slight right leg weakness (antigravity, but drift).        Sensory testing → no neglect.              What is the localization?          Patient has a Broca’s aphasia (expressive aphasia); Broca’s area is located in the ventral-most area of the premotor cortex.      Hemiparesis, with face and arms &gt; legs, suggests a deficit affecting the lower region of the precentral gyrus.        Differential Diagnosis:          Stroke → most likely in the area of the left MCA.      Can be either a ischemic stroke or a hemorrhagic stroke.        Regions supplied by the cerebral arteries:          Middle cerebral artery → lateral sides.      Anterior superior artery → frontal, and anteromedial sides.      Posterior cerebral artery → occipital, and posteromedial sides.        Broca’s Area → anterior, in the frontal lobe.  Wernicke’s Area → posterior, in the temporal lobe.Dominant Hemisphere MCA Stroke  Dominant hemisphere refers to the hemisphere where language is located (both Broca’s and Wernicke’s area).          Typically the left hemisphere if you’re right handed.      In left handers:                  60% will still be left hemisphere dominant.          19% will actually be right hemisphere dominant.          20% will have bilateral language representation!                    So, If you saw a left handed patient with left sided hemiparesis and aphasia, then this would suggest that their dominant hemisphere is on the right side.      However, if you saw a left handed patient with left sided hemiparesis and no aphasia, then this would suggest that their dominant hemisphere is on the left side, as with right handed people.        Wada testing → done in neurosurgery to identify the dominant hemisphere when planning surgery.          Involves using a catheter to inject a drug into the common carotid on one side, which transiently causes the corresponding hemisphere to ‘fall asleep’.      Language testing is then done with one hemisphere affected, to see if language is preserved.      Used so that the corresponding hemisphere can be avoided during surgery.        In patients with an MCA stroke, the lower portion of the homunculus is supplied by the MCA, so face and arm effect &gt; leg.  Depending on the region of the stroke (frontal, parietal, or internal capsule), you may have more specific effects:          If frontal lobe only, will have motor deficits (since precentral gyrus).      If parietal lobe only, will have sensory deficits (since postcentral gyrus).      If internal capsule (where fibres come together), can have both motor and sensory deficits.      Summary of Aphasia Syndromes  You DON’T need to know about (1) conduction, (2) transcortical motor, or (3) transcortical sensory aphasias (they won’t be tested).  You do however need to know about Broca’s, Wernicke’s, and global aphasias.

He calls 911 immediately when he realizes her speech is slurred and she’s not moving her left side.    PHx: HTN, DM2, MI 6 years ago    O/E: Oriented, but somewhat drowsy.              Obvious left facial droop, dysarthria        Only attends to right side. Eyes do not track past midline        Moderate weakness of left arm (some movement to peripheral pain) and left leg        Does not recognize left hand (believes its the examiner’s)        Left hemianesthesia              Localize the lesion:          Cortical findings (neglect) suggest that this is localized to the brain (L neglect suggests a problem with the R parietal cortex).      Left hemianesthesia suggests a problem with the right primary somatosensory cortex (parietal lobe).      Left facial droop, and arm and leg involvement, suggests that the motor cortex is affected as well (frontal lobe).      The regions involved are suggestive of a significant non-dominant MCA involvement (language is intact).        Differential Diagnosis → non-dominant MCA issue.          Ischemic Stroke.      Hemorrhagic Stroke.      Seizure (Todd’s paresis).        Here, a post-ictal (after seizure) deficit may be possible, since the couple was sleeping, and it’s possible that no one was awake while the seizure itself was going on.Non-dominant Hemisphere Infarcts  If these infarcts are large, they can be associated with prominent neglect syndromes:          Visual neglect.      Sensory neglect.      Asomatognosia → not recognizing own body parts.      Agnosognosia → not recognizing that they’ve had a stroke.      Dressing apraxia → have difficulty getting themselves dressed, because they don’t appreciate the fact that they have another side of their body.        These findings can make rehabilitation very challenging (if the patient doesn’t know they have deficits, how do you rehab them?)  The degree of motor deficits depends on if the stroke is more anterior than posterior.Case 3  Case Summary      47 year old man develops the sudden onset of severe vertigo and unsteadiness. He has vomited twice. His wife brings him to the emergency room because he cannot walk unassisted.    He smokes 1ppd, has treated hypertension, and has recently recovered from an URTI associated with frequent coughing. He thinks he may have pulled a muscle in his neck while coughing.    O/E → cognition intact. Full visual fields.  Dysmetria → lack of coordination of movement, with overshooting or undershooting of the desired endpoint.              Partial right ptosis. Rt pupil 3mm, Lt pupil 5mm but both reactive.        EOM full, but gaze evoked nystagmus worse with right gaze.        Subjective decrease to light touch on right face.        No facial weakness, dysarthria, or tongue weakness.        Power full and reflexes symmetric.        Pin and temperature sensation reduced over left side of body.        Dysmetria with right FTN testing.        Cannot ambulate secondary to vertigo/unsteadiness.              Describe the problem → acute onset of vertigo, Horner’s, crossed sensory symptoms, and ataxia.  Localize the lesion:          Right ptosis, right pupil 3 mm, left pupil 5 mm but both reactive, suggests right-sided Horner’s Syndrome (parasympathetic findings on R side).                  Recall that the classic triad for Horner’s syndrome is (1) ptosis, (2) miosis, and (3) anhydrosis (decreased sweating).          This is not an III nerve palsy (even though you’d have ptosis, the eye would be down and out due to unopposed action of IV and VI).          You would also expect a large pupil on that side (due to an inability to constrict the pupil on that side); here we see the opposite!          Unfortunately, Horner’s syndrome does not help much with localization because the sympathetic tract runs from hypothalamus → midbrain → pons → medulla → cervical spinal cord → T1.                    Decrease in sensation on R face with a decrease in pain and temperature sensation on L body (spinothalamic) suggests that this is a problem in the pons or medulla:                  This is the classic ‘crossed finding’ that you’d see with a pons or medullary syndrome!          This is because, although the trigeminal nerve leaves the brainstem at the pons, the trigeminal nucleus actually extends all the way into the medulla.          The sensory innervation from the trigeminal nerve only crosses after the nucleus, so any problem at the trigeminal nucleus results in an ipsilateral loss of facial sensation.          On the other hand, since the spinothalamic tracts cross when they enter the spinal cord, you also have a contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation.                    How do you differentiate a pons vs medulla lesion?                  The vertigo suggests that this is a medullary lesion.          This is because the vestibular nuclei (where the vestibular branch of CN VIII synapses), is located in the medulla.                      Diagnosis → Lateral Medullary Syndrome.Lateral Medullary Syndrome  Lateral Medullary Syndrome → caused by a lesion in the lateral medulla.          Also known as Wallenberg’s Syndrome.      Most commonly caused by an infarct in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA).        Findings associated with lateral medullary syndrome:          Ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome.      Ipsilateral facial sensory alteration.      Vertigo and nystagmus.      Contralateral pain and temperature loss on extremities.      Ipsilateral ataxia.        These findings are associated with the nuclei located in the lateral medulla:            Ataxia → since the inferior cerebellar peduncle is affected (brings proprioceptive info to the cerebellum).      Vertigo → due to involvement of the vestibular nuclei.      Ipsilateral face sensation decrease → due to involvement of the trigeminal nuclei.      Contralateral spinothalamic decrease → due to involvement of the spinothalamic tract laterally.      Horner’s Syndrome → due to involvement of the descending sympathetics.        The prognosis for Lateral Medullary Syndrome is excellent, with full or near full recovery by 6 months.          However, patients often develop intractable hiccups.      Case 3b  Case Summary      The lateral medullary sydrome patient is admitted to the hospital for stroke work-up and rehabilitation.    While eating his lunch one day, the nurses witness him suddenly slump over.    They rush over to him and notice that he can no longer speak and cannot follow commands.    You are paged immediately to evaluate him.    O/E → no vocalizations, cannot follow most commands.              Pupils 2 mm and not obviously reactive.        EOM: obvious bilateral abduction impairments, but able to look up and down consistently.        Absent bilateral corneal reflexes.        Gag reflex is absent. Has snoring respirations.        Extension posturing of arms and legs to central pain; no voluntary movement.              Localize the lesion:          Non-reactive pupils suggest a problem with CN II (afferent) or CN III (efferent).      Bilateral abduction impairments suggests involvement of CN VI on both sides (comes off of ponto-medullary junction).      Absent bilateral corneal reflexes suggest a problem with CN V (afferent) or CN VII (efferent).      Absent gag reflex suggests a problem with CN IX (afferent) or CN X (efferent).      Given that the patient already has had one stroke in his lateral medulla, and that:                  CN VI, VII, VIII come off the ponto-medullary junction          CN IX, X, and XI come off along the lateral medulla.                    This is highly suggestive of another lower brainstem problem.        Diagnosis → Basilar Thrombosis.Basilar Thrombosis  Basilar Thrombosis → thrombi in the basilar artery.            The basilar artery supplies the pons and medulla, and feeds into the Circle of Willis.      The Posterior Inferior Cerebellear Arteries are branches off the vertebral arteries, which merge to form the basilar artery.      Hence, the lateral medullary syndrome the patient had before is linked to this (clot propagation).        The prognosis for basilar thrombosis is TERRIBLE.  The book The Diving Bell and the Butterfly was written by someone who actually had a massive basilar artery stroke, and was transcribed solely through eye movements.          Patient may end up with locked-in syndrome, where they’re only able to move their eyes.                  (Partial) sparing of the eyes is because CN III does not run in the corticobulbar tract (unlike the other motor cranial nerves).          Hence, the patient still has the ability to move their medial rectus, inferior rectus, superior rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris.                    Because of the poor prognosis in these cases, tPA is given out of the window to try and break the clot.      Emergency neuroradiology intervention requested for interarterial thrombolysis and clot extraction.      Case 4  Case Summary      A 54 year old man presents with a 2 week history of right periorbital pain, a 3 day history of double vision, and a 1 day history of complete right sided ptosis.    PHx: No diabetes. Chronic sinusitis    O/E: Complete right sided ptosis.              Right eye laterally displaced. Only obvious movement of rt eye was abduction. No obvious depression of eye seen. Left eye movements were normal.        Left pupils 5mm and reactive. Right pupil 7mm and not reactive.        Hypersensitive to light touch over right forehead.        Remainder of neurological examination normal.              Localize the lesion:          This sounds (mostly) like a classical R third nerve palsy.      Since there’s unopposed action of CN VI, there’s abduction of the R eye.      The R sided ptosis is due to loss of action of the levator palpebrae superioris.      The loss of R pupil constriction and the pupillary light reflex is due to loss of action of the constrictor muscles.      The only aberrant finding is the hypersensitivity over the right forehead; this suggests involvement of V1 of the trigeminal.        Diagnosis → third nerve palsy.  What is the cause of the third nerve palsy?            The oculomotor nerve has a fairly long path, and it can be affected at any point along it.      In this case, since there’s involvement of V1 as well, this is most likely to be a problem at the cavernous sinus (eg. an infection).                  This is supported by the fact that he has sinusitis, and an infection can track up the facial vein → ophthalmic vein → cavernous sinus.                    Recall that CN III, CN IV, V1, and V2 are located on the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus.      When trying to localize the cause, it’s best to work anatomically (eg. orbit → superior orbital fissure → cavernous sinus, etc etc).      Case 5  Case Summary      58 year old woman with a 1 year history of progressive balance difficulties and a 1 month history of her left leg intermittently giving way while walking. Some increased urinary frequency.    PHx: nilsignificant.    CN Normal    Power:              UE normal        LE: HF 4+/4, KE 5/5, KF 4+/4, DF 4/4-, PF 5/5              Reflexes:              UE: 2’s and symmetric        LE: Knees 3/3, Ankles 3/3         Plantar responses: ↑↑              Sensation:              Vibration sensation absent at toes, present at ankles but reduced. Position sensation normal at toes.         Pinprick mildly reduced diffusely over legs.              Localize the lesion:          Positive Babinsky and lower limb hyperreflexia suggests an UMN problem.      Flexors (HF, KF, DF) &gt; extensors in leg → pyramidal weakness, further suggesting an UMN problem.      Both dorsal column and spinothalamic sensation loss, bilaterally.      CN nerve exam is normal, suggesting that this is not a brainstem problem. Involvement of lower limbs makes a spinal cord localization more likely than a cortical one.      A sensory level should be done to help localize the lesion.        Causes of Spinal Cord Dysfunction:          Structural Causes:  In this context, extramedullary = outside the spinal cord; intramedullary = inside the spinal cord. Medulla refers to the inner region of an organ or tissue.                  Extradural (eg. spondylosis, vertebral compression, #).          Intradural &amp; extramedullary (eg. meningioma).          Intramedullary (eg. intrinsic tumour, demyelination).                    Functional Causes:                  Complete cord lesion.          Hemicord (Brown-Sequard).          Posterior Cord Syndrome.          Anterior Cord Syndrome.          Central Cord Syndrome.

She has a chronic history of neck pain which has not changed recently. She also complains of occasional tingling of her baby finger. Denies any other weakness.    PHx: cholecystectomy and hysterectomy.    CN exam normal.    Power:              Obvious atrophy of right FDI and hypothenar eminences.        No fasciculations noted.        Left arm, left hand, and legs normal power.        Proximal right arm strength normal, grip normal.        FDI and ADM are both 4-.              Reflexes: → Biceps, BR, Triceps, Knees, Ankles 2’s and symmetric.    Sensation: → reduced pinprick to right 5th digit. Normal sensation of medial arm.    No Horner’s Syndrome.    Why is the lack of Horner’s Syndrome important?  Recall that Horner’s syndrome features the classic triad of miosis, ptosis, and anhydrosis.          The sympathetic chain runs from T1 to L2, so an avulsion of the T1 nerve root will also result in an ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome due to unopposed parasympathetic action.      The fact that there isn’t Horner’s syndrome suggests that the T1 nerve root is uninvolved.        Localize the lesion:          Reflexes are normal, and there’s muscle atrophy. This suggests a LMN problem.      There’s both weakness and sensation loss, which rules out a NMJ, muscle, or AHC cause.      Hence, we’re torn between a nerve root or peripheral nerve localization.                  Reduced pinprick over the right 5th digit is in the ulnar nerve distribution, or over the C8 dermatome.          FDI and ADM are both innervated by the ulnar nerve (all intrinsic muscles of the hand are ulnar except for the LOAF ones).          However, the ulnar nerve comes from C8 and T1, so this could still be due to a C8 avulsion.                      Differential of a weak/wasted hand:          Ulnar neuropathy (most common).      C8 radiculopathy.      Lower trunk plexopathy.      Motor neuron disease.      Intrinsic cervical spinal cord lesion.        In this case, how do you differentiate between an ulnar neuropathy versus a C8 radiculopathy?          Ulnar Neuropathy:                  Motor → flexor carpi ulnaris flexor digitorum profundus to digits 4 &amp; 5, interossei, abductor digiti minimi, adductor pollicus, 4th and 5th lumbricals.          Sensory → sensation to medial hand (ventral &amp; dorsal), and 4th and 5th digits. Provides no sensation above wrist.                    C8 Radiculopathy:                  Motor → same as with ulnar nerve, but ALSO FPL, EPL, and APL (so would have thumb weakness too).          Sensory → same as ulnar but ALSO medial forearm.                    In this case, since there’s no thumb involvement, and the weakness is specific to the hand, this is most likely an ulnar neuropathy.      Case 7  Case Summary      A 22 year old male presents with a left foot drop. He awoke with the foot drop one week prior to his presentation. The foot drop is painless and associated with numbness over the right lateral leg and dorsum of his foot.    What would you include on a focused examination?          Motor → bulk, tone, power, reflexes, pronator drift.      Sensory → spinothalamic (pain, temperature), dorsal column (proprioception, vibration sense).      Coordination → heel to shin.        DDx of a foot drop:          Peroneal neuropathy.      L5 radiculopathy.      Sciatic neuropathy.      Motor neuron disease.      Spinal cord pathology      Myopathy.        How would you differentiate between a peroneal neuropathy and a L5 radiculopathy?          Recall that the deep peroneal nerve innervates the anterior compartment, where the tibialis anterior is (dorsiflexor).      However, the nerve itself is supplied mainly by L5!      Findings shared by peroneal neuropathy and L5 radiculopathy:                  Weakness of tibialis anterior, extensor hallicus longus, foot eversion.          Reduced sensation to the lateral leg and dorsum of foot.                    Features suggestive of peroneal neuropathy:                  Typically painless, often caused by compression at fibular head           Normal other L5 muscle power (eg. hip abductors)          Reflexes: normal          Sensory deficit may be clearly defined                    Features suggestive of L5 radiculopathy:                  Typically painful          Power: possible weakness of hip abduction (gluteus medius), knee flexion, foot inversion          Reflex: may have an asymmetrical hamstring reflex          Sensory deficit less clearly defined.

	{"title": "Approach to Spinal Cord Pathology", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe the cross-sectional anatomy of the spinal cord.  Compare and contrast the sensory and motor input and output organization of the spinal cord.  Compare and contrast the common spinal cord syndromes.  Define the terms dermatome and myotome  Discuss the symptoms and signs of common cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathies  Describe the common causes of spinal cord injury.Introduction  The most common cause of spinal cord injury in any age group is trauma.  The spinal cord is critically important; it’s our only connection between the brain and the rest of our body.          Unlike other structures in our body, there’s no collateral spinal cord!        Recall that the spinal cord is shorter than the spinal column because the spinal column grows relatively faster during development.          The spinal cord stops at L1/L2.      As a result, nerve roots exit the spinal column progressively lower than their corresponding level in the spinal cord.      In addition, any injury below the level of L1/L2 cannot be a spinal cord injury, and is thus a LMN problem (as mentioned before).        Recall from MSK that there are 8 cervical spinal nerves, but only 7 cervical vertebrae.          As a result, all the C1-C7 nerve roots exit above their corresponding vertebrae, and C8 exits below C7.      For all subsequent nerve roots, they then exit below their corresponding vertebrae.        With a spinal cord injury, we refer to the injury by the ‘highest functioning spinal cord level’.          eg. if the deltoids were working, but nothing above that, this would be a C5 quadraplegia.        Pancoast Tumour → a lung tumour at the apex of the lung.          Since this tumour is near the brachial plexus, it can lead to weakness and sensory deficits in the arm.      Key Myotomes  C3, C4, C5 → Diaphragm (C3,4,5 keeps the diaphragm alive).  C5 → Deltoids.  C5, C6 → Biceps.  C6 → Brachioradialis.  C7 → Triceps (C7,8, lay them straight).  C8, T1 → Fingers.  L2, L3 → Hip Flexion.  L3, L4 → Knee Extension.  L5, S1 → Hip Extension.  L5, S1 → Knee Flexion.  L5 → Dorsiflexion.  S1 → Plantarflexion.Key Dermatomes  C6 → Thumb.  C7 → Middle finger.  C8 → Little finger.  T1 → Armpit.  T4 → Nipple.  T10 → Umbilicus.  T12 → Groin.  L5 → Big toe.  S1 → Little toe.  S2,3,4 → Perineum.White Fibre Tracts in the Spinal Cord  Ascending Sensory Tracts:  If you see both the gracile and cuneate fasciculus, then this must be a cervical cross-section, since you could only see the gracile fasciculus if you were below the upper extremities.          Gracile Fasciculus → light touch, vibration of LE.      Cuneate Fasciculus → light touch, vibration, proprioception of the UE.      Spinocerebellar Tract → proprioception of LE.                  This isn’t too important to know; just pretend that the dorsal column is responsible for all light touch, vibration, and proprioception.                    Spinothalamic Tract → crude touch, pain, temperature (crossed).        Descending Motor Tracts:          Corticospinal → motor innervation.      Sympathetic output → bowel &amp; bladder.      Spinal Cord Injuries  A spinal cord injury can either be complete or incomplete:          Complete → both sides affected; motor and all sensory modalities affected; bowel and bladder all affected.      Incomplete → one or more components are spared.      Incomplete Lesions of the Spinal Cord  Brown Sequard Syndrome → hemitransection of the spinal cord. Below the level of injury, we would have:          Ipsilateral weakness (since descending motor innervation has already crossed at the pyramidal decussation).      Ipsilateral light touch, vibration, and proprioception loss (since the dorsal column fibres ascend straight up the spinal cord without crossing).      Contralateral pain and temperature loss (since the spinothalamic fibres cross immediately after entering the spinal cord).        Anterior Cord Syndrome → spares the dorsal columns, since it affects the anterior cord only.          Intact light touch, proprioception, and vibration sense, due to sparing of the dorsal columns.      Bilateral pain and temperature loss due to bilateral disruption of the spinothalamic tract.      Bilateral weakness due to bilateral disruption of the corticospinal tracts.       Anterior cord syndrome is often due to trauma, or due to a problem with blood supply from the anterior spinal artery. Hence, it’s often seen in older patients with aortic atherosclerosis, or after aortic aneurysm surgery.      The unpaired anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior 2/3s of the spinal cord.                  Since there’s no collateral circulation here, disruption of this blood supply can lead to anterior cord syndrome.                    The paired posterior spinal arteries supply the dorsal columns.                  Since they’re paired, the dorsal columns are less susceptible to vascular injury.                      Posterior Cord Syndrome → involvement of the dorsal columns only, with sparing of the anterior cord.          Bilateral light touch, proprioception, and vibration loss, due to involvement of the dorsal columns.      Intact motor, pain, and temperature.      Posterior Cord Syndrome is seen with Syphillis and Vitamin B12 deficiency.        Central Cord Syndrome → involvement of the central spinal cord.          Dorsal column sparing.      Pain &amp; Temperature Cape Anesthesia → loss of sensation over the area where you’d wear a ‘cape’ (shoulders, upper back).      UE weakness &gt; LE weakness → it’s thought that this is because the corticospinal tract is arranged such that upper extremity fibres are more proximal than the lower extremity ones (see below).      Often seen in older patients after a fall, where there’s neck hyperextension.       Summary of Incomplete Spinal Cord Lesions                   Causes      Dorsal Column Impairment      Spinothalamic Impairment      Corticospinal Impairment                  Brown-Sequard Syndrome (hemitransection)      Trauma      Ipsilateral      Contralateral      Ipsilateral              Anterior Cord Syndrome      Impaired blood supply via the anterior spinal artery, trauma      Spared      Bilateral      Bilateral              Posterior Cord Syndrome      Syphillis or Vitamin B12 Deficiency      Bilateral      Spared      Spared              Central Cord Syndrome      Neck hyperextension, especially in older patients after a fall.      Spared      Cape anesthesia      UE weakness &gt; LE weakness      Nerve Root Syndromes  Now, instead of focusing on the spinal cord, we’ll be focusing on diseases related to the nerve roots:          Lumbar radiculopathy → affecting the lumbar nerve roots.      Cervical radiculopathy → affecting the cervical nerve roots.        These are most commonly caused by disc herniations.            In the lumbar area, a L4/L5 disc herniation would result in impingement of the L5 nerve.      Even though the L4 nerve runs below the vertebrae, it actually still goes above the disc (see image on the right).      So a herniation at L4/L5 would cause L5 compression.        How do you differentiate a nerve root problem from a spinal cord problem?          As has been mentioned (many, many) times before, there are key features that differentiate a UMN problem from a LMN problem, as are listed below.      Recall that since the spinal cord ends at L1/L2, any injury below that can only be a LMN problem.        Upper Motor Neuron vs Lower Motor Neuron Findings                             UMN        LMN                            Muscle Atrophy        No        Yes                    Fasciculations        No        Yes                    Tone        Increased        Normal                    Spasticity        Yes        No                    Reflexes        Increased        Decreased                    Babinski        Upgoing        Downgoing            Lumbar Findings            Disc      Root      Motor      Sensory      Reflex                  L3-4      L4      Knee Extension      Medial Knee      Knee jerk              L4-5      L5      Ankle dorsiflexion, eversion      Lateral calf, great toe, 1st webbed space                     L5-S1      S1      Ankle plantar flexion      Lateral aspect of foot, lateral toes      Ankle jerk        Memory Aids (Motor):          L4 → knee extension (L3,4 out the door).      L5 → walking on heels (dorsiflexion strength).      S1 → walking on toes (plantar flexion strength).        Memory Aids (Sensory):          Recall that the superficial peroneal nerve provides sensory innervation to all of the dorsum of the foot, except the 1st webbed space, which is innervated by the deep peroneal nerve.      The deep peroneal nerve also innervates the anterior compartment of the leg, which has the dorsiflexors.      Hence, we have that L5 → dorsiflexion (walking on heels) → anterior compartment → deep peroneal nerve → 1st webbed space.      Cervical Findings  Unlike the lumbar nerve roots, which are in the cauda equina, the cervical nerve roots come directly off the spinal cord.          As a result, an injury to the spinal cord can sometimes also affect the nerve roots, resulting in both UMN and LMN findings.      This makes cervical disc disease a little harder to interpret than lumbar disc disease.        Example: Patient with a 6 month history of neck pain, R arm pain, right arm weakness and bilateral leg weakness.          Atrophy of right biceps with decreased reflex (LMN) at the level.      Bilateral leg weakness with increased tone and hyperreflexia below the compression (UMN).        Here, we have mixed findings due to both a spinal cord injury and a nerve root injury.  Remember      Because the cervical nerve roots come directly off the spinal cord, an injury may cause both UMN and LMN findings.

	{"title": "ALS &amp; MND Team", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Identify the typical symptoms and signs associated with ALS.  Understand how multidisciplinary care can assist with the management of patients with ALS.  Be aware of management options for some ALS symptoms.An Overview of ALS  ALS → Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.          A neurodegenerative condition causing both upper and lower motor neuron weakness.      Uncommon condition; incidence is 2-3/100,000.      Symptoms either start in their speech/swallowing muscles (known as bulbar ALS), or in their limbs.        Characterized by progressive, relentless weakness, spreading eventually to most regions of the body.  Survival → an average of 3 years after onset.          Death is usually due to respiratory muscle failure or aspiration pneumonia.      Pathophysiology of ALS  ALS is a MND (MND = motor neuron disease).  Loss of motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord (anterior horn cells).  5% of cases are hereditary (AD and AR inheritance, depending on the mutation); the remainder appear sporadic.  The cause of motor neuron death in sporadic cases is uncertain:          Likely due to a combination of (1) genetic predisposition, (2) environmental exposures, and maybe (3) chance events (eg. spontaneous protein misfolding).      Diagnosis of ALS  A diagnosis of ALS requires:          Consistent history (isolated motor symptoms, which are progressive. No sensory findings).      Both UMN and LMN signs (since both cortical motor neurons and anterior horn cells are affected).                  LMN signs → atrophy, fasciculations.          UMN signs → hyperreflexia, spasticity.                    ≥ 2 regions affected → as before, with no prominent extra-motor involvement.      Investigations for other causes negative:                  Nerve conduction studies (peripheral nerve problems).          MRI, CSF evaluation.          Metabolic assessments.                      Diagnosis of ALS      Consistent History → isolated, progressive motor symptoms with sensory sparing.    Both UMN and LMN signs.    ≥ 2 regions affected.    Investigations for other causes negative.  ALS Treatment  No cure for ALS.  The only approved pharmacological treatment is a drug called riluzole:          Riluzole is a glutamate antagonist (recall that glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain).      Riluzole then reduces excitotoxicity (it prevents excessive stimulation of neurons which occurs as an attempt to compensate for motor neuron loss).      Riluzole is only mildly effective; only extends life by 2-3 months.        BiPAP support can also help extend life when there’s signs of respiratory insufficiency due to involvement of the muscles of respiration.  Most important treatment → management of symptoms.          This requires a multidisciplinary team to manage symptoms and functional limitations effectively.      Case Example  Case Summary      A 53 year old man presented with progressive dysarthria, dysphagia, extremity weakness and shortness of breath on exertion over an 8 month interval.    Examination Findings:              Spastic dysarthria.        Tongue fasciculations and atrophy.        Left arm fasciculations and mild weakness.        Diffuse hyperreflexia.        No sensory involvement.              Here we see both UMN and LMN findings:          UMN findings → spastic dysarthria, diffuse hyperreflexia.      LMN findings → fasciculations, atrophy.      Since there was no sensory involvement as well, this was highly suggestive of ALS.        Additional Information      Multiple investigations ruled out alternative explanations.              The diagnosis of ALS was given              Over the next 18 months:              Dyspnea worsened requiring the initiation of BiPAP        Arm and hand weakness progressed        Leg weakness worsened, requiring use of bilateral AFOs (ankle foot orthotics, for foot-drop) initially and then later a wheelchair.        Dysarthria and dysphagia progressed, but still communicated orally and ate orally.              As mentioned before, in managing these diffuse symptoms, a multi-disciplinary team is required.  Descriptions of each of their roles are as follows:Multidisciplinary Care  ALS patients are seen every 3-6 months; 3 if their disease is more rapidly progressive, and 6 if their disease is more mildly progressive.  Members of the ALS team include speech language pathology, PT, OT, social work, dietician, nursing, and physicians.Speech Language Pathology  Communication          Dysarthria → in the context of ALS, this can be spastic, flaccid, or both.                  Management involves using ‘compensatory strategies’ for the patient and family, such as energy conservation or different articulation techniques.          AAC devices (Augmented &amp; alternative communication) are also used; these can be both high tech (iPad) or low tech (a picture board).                    Language → ALS is progressive, so SLPs have to counsel the patient and their family about progressive difficulties with speaking.        Swallowing          Assessment of swallowing → clinical assessment, modified barium swallow, FEES (Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing, via a nasopharyngoscope).      Compensatory strategies (more finely chopped or pureed foods).      Discussion about feeding tubes.      Physiotherapy  Respiratory Issues → SOB and prevention of aspiration pneumonia.          Understanding and managing SOBOE (SOB on exertion), and orthopnea → balancing their activity, methods to raise their beds.      Teach them the signs of chest infection, and strategies to prevent them (bronchial hygiene).      Management of airway secretion clearance as patient cough gets weaker.       Methods of clearance include deep breathing and coughing instruction, assisted cough techniques, volume augmentation, manual chest percussion (just like with CF), and suction.        Upper extremity issues:          Education, maintenance of joint motion via ROM exercises.      As the disease progresses, these exercises switch from active to passive (ie. someone else helps them go through the motions).      Collaboration with the CCAC to treat joint pain.        Lower extremity issues:          Education → teach about spasticity, and stretching exercises to reduce tone.      Management of dependent edema.      Gait aids: AFOs → canes → walkers → wheelchairs.      Transfer techniques.      Occupational Therapy  OTs look at day to day activities:          They’re the ones that help patients with their ADLs and IADLs.      In the context of ALS, this helps them maintain their independence early on, and their participation later on.      Revolves around the use of compensatory techniques, equipment, external resources, and home/vehicle modification.      Social Work  Psychosocial assessment → what’s important to the patient, and what’s important to the family.          Community supports, hobbies and interests.      Source of income, insurance coverage.      Wills, Powers of Attorney.      Care needs, disability financial coverage.      Dieticians  Review of the patient’s current eating routine.  Identify co-morbidies requiring nutritional intervention/monitoring.  Review drugs and vitamin/mineral or herbal supplements for potential interactions.  Review bowel patterns, fluid intake, screen for skin integrity issues.  Determine if the patient is able to meet current nutritional requirements.          If not, make recommendations for supplementation or changes in feeding routine.      Consider enteral feeding.      Nursing  Explain what the Motor Neuron Diseases team is and what we do.  Give them contact information, and an ALS manual.  Coordinates team meetings and organizes patient follow-up.          They are the first line contact for patients seeking info from the ALS team.        Assistance with coordination of clinical trials in ALS.Physicians  Confirmation of the diagnosis.  Pharmacologic management of:          Sialorrhea (hypersalivation), spasticity, pain, constipation, depression, pseudobulbar affect (difficulty regulating emotions).        Management of respiratory symptoms (BiPAP initiation and monitoring).  Discussions around end-of-life care.

	{"title": "Approach to Weakness", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Distinguish motor weakness from other symptoms that may be termed “weakness”.  Ask appropriate questions of patients with weakness to characterize and localize the problem.  Identify aspects of the neurologic examination that assist in characterizing and localizing weakness.  Distinguish upper motor neuron lesions from lower motor neuron lesions based on clinical features.  Determine the location in the nervous system of the lesion causing a patient’s weakness, based upon their clinical presentation.What is Weakness?  Weakness → a loss of voluntary movement due to interruption of the motor pathways at any point from the cerebrum to the muscle fibre.  Possible Localizations:          Brain.      Brainstem.      Spinal Cord.      Anterior Horn Cells.      Root(s).      Plexus.      Peripheral Nerves.      Neuromuscular Junction.      Mucle.      Key Findings on History  Where → is it on one limb, on one side, or on both sides?  How → is it abrupt, or gradual/progressive?  Functional Impact → may help distinguish proximal from distal weakness           Distal weakness will present with problems with dextrous movements.      Proximal weakness will present with problems lifting objects or climbing stairs.        Other symptoms:          Concomitant changes in sensation?      Speech/language problems → suggests a cortical problem.      Bowel/bladder dysfunction.      Pain.        The physical exam serves to CONFIRM the location, extent, and characteristics of the weakness.Grading Power  Recall the MRC (Medical Research Council) Scale:          0 → no activity.      1 → flickers.      2 → active movement without gravity only.      3 → active movement against gravity.      4 → reduced power (4-, 4, 4+ used to discriminate severity).      5 → full power.      The Neurologic Examination  The key here is to differentiate an upper motor neuron problem versus a lower motor neuron problem.  Upper Motor Neuron → caused by interruption of the corticospinal pathways.          The causative lesion can be at any point along this pathway:      This includes the cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, internal capsule, brainstem, and spinal cord.        Lower Motor Neuron → caused by interruption distal to the spinal cord.          This includes the AHCs, roots, plexuses, peripheral nerves, NMJs, and muscle.        As we’ve seen in PCCM, these have different clinical features:  Upper Motor Neuron vs Lower Motor Neuron                    Upper Motor Neuron        Lower Motor Neuron                            Weakness in a pyramidal distribution        Depends on etiology                    Spasticity        Normal Tone                    Hyperreflexia        Reduced or absent reflexes                    Extensor plantar response (positive Babinsky)        Normal plantar flexion response (or absent)                    No significant atrophy (only from disuse)        Atrophy                    No fasciculations        Fasciculations MAY be present              Fasciculations → contractions of individual muscle fascicles (can be seen as ‘fluttering’).  Recall that a pyramidal distribution is as follows:          Arm extensors &lt; arm flexors → ie. the flexors of the arm are stronger, and the patients arms/wrists will be flexed.      Leg extensors &gt; leg flexors → ie. the extensors of the leg are stronger, so the patient’s legs/ankles will be extended &amp; plantar flexed respectively.        What is the difference between spasticity and rigidity?          Spasticity → a velocity dependent increase in tone.      Rigidity → a velocity independent increase in tone.      Key Localization FeaturesWeakness Localizing to the Brain  Type → Upper motor neuron.  Pattern → hemiplegia/hemiparesis (ie. one side of your body will be affected).          If the face/arm &gt; leg, this suggests MCA territory, since it’ll affect the bottom of the precentral gyrus more than the top, and this is where the face/arms of the motor homunculus lie (the homunculus is ‘upside down’).      If the leg &gt; face/arm, this suggests ACA territory, since it’ll affect the top of the precentral gyrus more than the bottom.      If the face = arm = leg, then this suggests the internal capsule, where all the cortical fibres have coalesced.        Look for other signs suggestive of a cortical problem:          Aphasia (Broca’s localizes to the frontal lobe; Wernicke’s to the temporal lobe).      Neglect (neglect in one hemifield suggests a problem with the contralateral cortex).      Headache, seizures.        Causes → STROKE, brain tumour, MS.Weakness Localizing to the Brainstem  Type → Upper motor neuron.  Pattern → hemiparesis (or even quadriparesis, if it’s a problem that broadly affects the brainstem).  Other clues:          Cranial nerve symptoms; diplopia, VII nerve palsy, vertigo (the cranial nerves come off the brainstem).      Crossed findings → eg. sensory findings on the ipsilateral face, and the contralateral body.      The reason you have crossed findings is because both the acending dorsal column and spinothalamic tracts from the body will have crossed over at this point (hence contralateral sensory deficits from the body), but the ascending sensory tracts from the trigeminal nucleus might not have crossed over yet (hence ipsilateral sensory deficits from the face).        Causes → STROKE, MS, tumour (just like the brain).Weakness Localizing to the Spinal Cord  Type → Upper motor neuron.  Pattern → paraplegia/quadraplegia.          You should have weakness below the level of injury.      So if you have an injury to the cervical spinal cord, you might have quadraplegia (all 4 limbs affected).      If you have injury to the thoracic spinal cord, your arms may be spared, but your lower body and legs may be affected (paraplegia).        Other clues:          Neck/back pain.      Presence of urinary symptoms (ie. incontinence); the nerves that control the urinary system go through the spinal cord.      Sensory level → ie. when you examine their sensation, they may be normal above the level of their lesion, and will have sensory findings below the level of their lesion.        Causes → Trauma, disc herniation, tumour, epidural hemorrhage, MS, demyelinating lesions, etc.Weakness Localizing to the Anterior Horn Cell  Anterior Horn Cell → the cell body of the motor neurons that travel to the muscles.          Although these are located in the spinal cord, they are considered ‘lower motor neuron’.        Type → Lower motor neuron.  Pattern → segemental lower motor neuron weakness without sensory loss.  Causes → Polio and poliomyelitis-like diseases.          One example of a polio-like disease is West Nile Virus.      ALS is also often considered in this category as well.      However, ALS isn’t anterior horn specific; it also has UMN features because it involves cortical motor neurons as well.      Weakness Localizing to the Nerve Root  Type → Lower motor neuron.  Pattern → myotomal weakness.          Will also have reduced reflexes in a specific nerve root distribution.        Other clues:          May have back or neck pain radiating into a limb (suggests a posterolateral disc herniation impinging on a nerve root).      Will also have dermatomal sensory loss (motor + sensory findings).        Causes → Disc herniation, spinal foraminal stenosis.  What about problems that affect multiple nerve roots?          Weakness will involve multiple muscles, spanning more than one root level.      Examples include cauda equina syndrome, infectious polyradiculitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.      Weakness Localizing to the Plexus  Type → Lower motor neuron.  Pattern → will involve weakness/atrophy in a one limb involving more mucles than those innervated by a single peripheral nerve or a single nerve root.          It may often be difficult to differentiate an injury to a plexus from an injury to multiple nerve roots.        Causes → Trauma, tumour, inflammatory.Weakness Localizing to the Peripheral Nerve  Type → Lower motor neuron.  Patterns (we saw this in MSK, in the Nerve Injuries lecture):          Mononeuropathy (single nerve).      Polyneuropathy → two types:                  Length dependent → the longest nerves are affected first, such as the ones going from the lumbar spine to the feet (hence, their symptoms will often ascend symmetrically from their toes).          Mononeuritis multiplex (aka. multiple mononeuropathies).                    Weakness Localizing to the Neuromuscular Junction  Type → Lower motor neuron.  Pattern → Descending weakness.          Eye muscles will usually be affected first (ptosis/diplopia), especially with myasthenia gravis.      Speech and swallowing will often follow.        Other clues:  The fluctuant nature of the weakness is because the muscles will be fatiguable. In Myasthenia gravis, since antibodies block the Ach receptors, patients will often be less able to sustain successive depolarizations.          You will often see fluctuating weakness of certain voluntary muscles.      Motor exclusive findings; sensation will be normal (since this is NMJ specific).      Reflexes will usually be normal, since diseases like myasthenia gravis usually work from the top down.        Causes → Myasthenia gravis.  Remember      A peripheral polyneuropathy that is length dependent will present with ascending findings (from the toes up).    A neuromuscular junction problem like myasthenia gravis will present with descending findings (from the eyes down).   Weakness Localizing to the Muscle  Type → Lower motor neuron.  Pattern → Proximal muscle weakness.          The most proximal muscles that we have are our axial muscles (trunk, shoulder, hip girdle).      Hence these patients will often have problems with maintaining neck and spine stability.        Other clues → since muscle specific, will have no sensory involvement, and relfexes will be normal.  Causes → Inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis, dermatomyositis), muscular dystrophies.  Summary of Localization Features  A Glove and stocking distribution refers to sensory loss in the pattern in which you’d put on gloves or stockings (ie. distal to proximal). For instance, a ‘stocking distribution’ would refer to loss of sensation in the toes → feet → ankles.                    Localization        Pattern of Weakness        UMN/LMN        Sensory Involvement                            Brain        Pyramidal, hemibody        UMN        +/-                    Brainstem        Pyramidal        UMN        May have crossed sensory                    Spinal Cord        Pyramidal, quadriparesis/paraparesis        UMN        Sensory level                    Root        Myotomal        LMN        Dermatomal                    Mononeuropathy        Single nerve        LMN        Single nerve                    Peripheral Neuropathy        Distal weakness        LMN        Glove &amp; Stocking dist’n                    Neuromuscular junction        Ocular, descending weakness        LMN        None                    Myopathy        Proximal weakness        LMN        None              Be wary of mimics of weakness:  Easy way to remember ataxia vs apraxia: apraxia has a ‘P’, so it’s related to PLANNING movements.          Ataxia (loss of coordination of movements) → could suggest a cerebellar problem instead.      Apraxia (difficulty planning movements) → could suggest a cortical problem instead (eg. premotor cortex).      Severe sensory loss → eg. proprioceptive failure; may lead to loss of balance that may be mistaken for weakness.      Case ExamplesExample 1  Case Summary      A fifty year old man has a 2 week history of difficultyclimbing stairs and getting dressed.              Exam shows moderate weakness of neck flexion, neck extension, and bilateral deltoids, triceps, hip flexion, and hip abduction.        Reflexes normal. Tone normal.        Sensation normal.              Where does this localize to?          Since there’s no hyper-reflexia, this seems to be LMN.      Here we see bilateral, symmetric weakness.      It also predominantly affects the proximal muscles (shoulders, trunk, hips).      Sensation and reflexes are normal, suggesting that this isn’t a problem with a nerve, or root.      In other words, this seems to localize to the muscle.      Example 2  Case Summary      A 80 year old man has a 2 month history of difficultywalking. He also complains his feet are numb.              DF 4, PF 4+ bilaterally and remainder of power is full (including KF, hip abd, HE).        Ankle reflexes absent. Remainder of reflexes normal.        Pin prick reduced to level of knee and over medial/lateral and posterior leg. Vibration absent to mid foot.              Where does this localize to?          Hyporeflexia suggests a LMN problem.      There seems to be weakness in addition to sensory findings; this rules out a NMJ or muscle problem.      Since the loss is in a ‘stocking distribution’, this is suggestive of a peripheral neuropathy; a problem at the level of the nerve.      With a peripheral neuropathy, once the ‘socks get up to the knees’, then you also begin to get finger-tip involvement.      Hence the pattern of progression is usually: toes → feet → ankles → legs → knees → fingers.      Multiple roots are also possible (dorsiflexion is L5, plantar flexion is S1).                  However, since hip abduction is mediated by L4/L5, and knee flexion by S1, their ‘full power’ makes this less likely.                    Example 3  Case Summary      28 year old woman complains of leg weakness and balance impairment.  HF = hip flexors; KF = knee flexors; DF = dorsiflexors.              Mild (4+) weakness of both HF, KF, and DF. With normal power elsewhere.        Arm reflexes are 2s, knees and ankles are 3s. Plantar responses extensor bilaterally.        Vibration impaired at both great toes. Pin prick reduced globally over both legs and up to the inferior scapula bilat.              Where does this localize to?          Positive Babinsky (plantor extensor response), hyper-reflexia, and pyramidal weakness suggests that this is an UMN problem.      Since weakness is specific to the lower limbs, with an associated sensory level, this seems like a spinal cord problem.        Where in the spinal cord is this? (what vertebral body?)          Knees and ankles are hyper-reflexic; the knee reflex is L3/4.      However, there’s reduced sensation up to the inferior scapula, this suggests something up to T4.      Hence this is a T4 problem.      IMPORTANT → The sensory level is the most helpful thing to use in localizing a spinal cord lesion.      Recall that myelopathy → spinal cord pathology.        A spinal cord problem can only be cervical or thoracic:          IMPORTANT → since the spinal cord ends at L1/L2, below that point any compression will only result in root compression, which is a LMN problem.                  In other words, you can’t have a lesion below L1/L2 and get UMN findings!          So if you have UMN findings, it has to be a thoracic or cervical cord problem.                    Hence, you should NEVER order a lumbar spine MRI if a patient has a myelopathy with UMN features.        Remember      Since the spinal cord ends at L1/L2, you can only have UMN features with a thoracic or cervical cord problem.    Never order a lumbar spine MRI in a patient with UMN features.

His intraocular pressure was 28mmHg in the right eye, and 15mmHg in the left eye.  Glaucoma → optic nerve damage.  Incidence can be as high as 10% in the older population.  Can be classified into 2 categories:          Open-angle →      Closed-angle →        Describe what you see in the above photos          Difference in the cup:disc ratio (R &gt; L). The cup:disc ratio on the R is greater than the left.      If they were both the same as in the R eye, and the pressures weren’t elevated, then this may just be a normal variant (they were born that way).      Normal intraocular pressure = 21; &gt; 21 is suspicious.        What is the most likely diagnosis?          Enlarged cup:disc ratio combined with an increased R intraocular pressure suggests glaucoma.      More specifically, this is suggestive of open angle glaucoma.      Look at the angle and make sure that it’s open, to verify the diagnosis.        What constitutes a ‘suspicious’ appearing optic nerve  What constitutes an elevated intraocular pressure?  What are the main risk factors for this condition?          Age; older age increases risk.      Family history of glaucoma.      Race; Africans have an increased risk.      Thin corneas.        List 3 classes of medications that reduce intraocular pressure and their mechanism of action          Prostaglandin analogues → increased outflow.      Beta blockers → decreased production.      α-2 agonists → both increased outflow and decreased production.      (Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) → decreased production.        What are the main systemic side effects of these medications?          Beta blockers → bronchospasm in asthmatics, reduced HR.      α-2 agonists → can cause apnea in children.      Strabismus  Case Summary      A 3-year-old child was noted to have an in-turning eye for the past several months. It was intermittent at first, but is now constant.    Strabismus  Corneal light reflex. Hirschberg reflex.  Often have wide inter-canthal bridge.  Children do not fix and follow until 3 months of age.  What is the medical term for an ‘in-turning eye’? An ‘out-turning’ eye?          Esotropia → in-turning eye.      Exotropia → out-turning eye.        What are relevant questions that should be asked on history?          Duration of symptoms, OPQRST.      Is the in/out-turning constant or intermittent?      Trauma → eg. forceps delivery at birth.      Prematurity.      Developmental milestones (assess neurological development).        What is the danger of preferential fixation with one eye?          Amblyopia → where the visual cortex doesn’t develop properly on the side that receives input from the affected eye (sensitive period).        What physical sign is visible in the photograph?          Esotropia → in-turning of the L eye.        What tests can a family doctor do in their office if they are concerned about strabismus?          Corneal light reflex.      Cover test (cover the good eye, and see if the bad eye can fixate).        When should a child with strabismus be referred to an ophthalmologist?          ASAP; you don’t want amblyopia to develop!        What are the treatment options for strabismus?          Occlusion (patching) → cover the good eye.      Glasses → if accomodative (LOOK UP).      Surgery → if more conservative options fail.      Chronic Visual Loss  Case Summary      A 60 year-old male complains of a progressive decline in vision in his right eye over the last 6 months.    What is responsible for this patient’s visual loss?          Cataracts → there’s whiteness over the pupil.        What are the early symptoms of this ocular condition?          Blurry vision.

Retina  Describe what you see in the photo.          Hemorrhage → in the centre of the image.      Drusen → yellow flecks on the surface of the retina. Drusen are made up of lipids, a fatty protein. Drusen are often a normal clinical finding with age, and do not necessarily suggest macular degeneration.      Vessel changes → more narrow and tortuous.         What is the most likely diagnosis?          AMD -&gt; Advanced Macular Degeneration.        What testing can a family physician perform to help determine the diagnosis?          Amsler grid. Grid of squares, tell if looks distorted or not.      If not Amsler grid present, use any straight line.

Medial = spinocerebellum = vermis (midline) + intermediate cerebellum (lateral to vermis).  Lateral = cerebrocerebellum = lateral cerebellum.  Vestibulocerebellum = flocculonodular lobe.          Tucked underneath the other lobules of the brain, like the insular cortex.      Important functions in eye movements, balance, equilibrium.      Structurally similar, differ in IO.      Basic Circuit.The basic circuit is the same in the cerebellum.3 parts:  Direct path = sensory input -&gt; motor output.  Indirect side-loop:          Mossy fibre side loop.

This is the error detection signal.      Circuit used for learning what needs correcting (the teacher).      Purkinje cell only gets input from ONE CLIMBING FIBRE.      Hence, each purkinje cell gets weak input from multiple mossy fibres, and strong input only one climbing fibre.MOSSY FIBRE INPUT = WEAK BUT BROAD.CLIMBING FIBRE INPUT = STRONG BUT PRECISE      Purkinje cells INHIBIT the deep cerebellar nuceli. Only output from the cerebellum.FUNCTION OF THE 3 FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF THE CEREBELLUM:  Vestibulocerebellum = flocculonodular lobe.          Input: vestibular organs (inner ear).      Output: vestibular nuclei to eye, limb, and trunk (help maintain balance).      Function: tunes balance (stance and gait), and the vestibulo-ocular reflex.      Damage: balance problems:                  Ataxic gait (wide-based, looks drunk, poor sense of balance)          Romberg sign (imbalance worsens if eyes closed).

Output: TO THE SPINAL CORD via the fastigial nucleus (vermis).      Function: Tunes and adjusts ongoing movements and muscle tone.      Damage:                   Ataxic gait due to poor control of muscle problems (unlike before, where ataxia due to balance issue).          ‘Drunk-driver test’ -&gt; falls when walking heel to toe.

EXAMPLE OF CEREBELLAR FUNCTIONVOR = vestibulo-ocular reflex, helps keep your eyes fixated on same place when your head moves.Gain of VOR = 1 if appropriately tuned.If motion of visual world on retina, then inappropriately tuned.Inappropriate tuning (retinal slip) results in a STRONG error signal from the climbing fibre, in addition to the signals from the mossy fibres that show what was done (student).Adujst strength at which parallel fibres talk to purkinje cells to modulate the response.Meniere’s Disease.Something wrong with fluid of inner ear.Affects vestibular afferents.1. At disease onset, produces a VOR imbalance, which results in nystagmus.2. Cerebellar response rebalances VOR to cause nystagmus to subside.3. As Meniere’s resolves, your VOR is now tuned to the pathological condition.4. Now you have nystagmus in the opposite direction.5. Nystagmus eventually disappears once the cerebellum restores the proper VOR gain again.(find cool eye animations!)Prism experiments.Put on googles which shift visual world.Goggles put mismatch in visual world.Body rapidly corrects within a few throws.When prisms removed, then have deviation in the opposite direction because we’re now tuned to the pathological condition.In patients with cerebellar lesions, they CANNOT ADAPT TO THE PRISM.The cerebellum acts like a repair shopIt learns to adapt to new tasks, and learn new motor skillsMotor disorders produced by lesions outside the cerebellum are quickly masked by this repair shopCerebellar lesions produce more long‐lasting disorders because the repair shop is itself damagedNeurophysiology of the Basal GangliaThe basal ganglia releaseappropriate movements andsuppress inappropriatemovements from premotor andmotor areasDamage to the basal ganglia is inpart responsible for Tourette’ssyndrome, which causes therelease of inappropriateutterances.TIC LIKE BEHAVIOURS.Focus on motor control here, but also plays a role in many other things, including emotion.Basal ganglia = caudate nucleus + putamen + globus pallidus + amygdala.Striatum = caudate + putamen.Substantia nigra pars reticulata projects to the superior colliculus for control of eye movements.Substantia nigra pars compacta = critical in parkinsons.Subthalamic nucleus = balancing output of basal ganglia.Striatum receives dopaminergic innervation from SUBSTANTIA NIGRA (PARS COMPACTAA).At rest, tonic inhibition from basal ganglia.WHen you want to move, inhibition of inhibitory stimulation from basal ganglia -&gt; permissive.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/24/neurophysiology-cerebellum-basal-ganglia.html"},

	{"title": "Descending Motor Pathways", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Name and describe the function of the major motor pathways through the brain to the spinal cord.  Understand the overview of motor control at all levels of the neuraxis.Motor Neurons  Motor commands from the brain go down the spinal cord, and synapse on lower motor neurons.  There are 2 types of lower motor neurons:          Alpha (α) motor neuron → goes to extrafusal muscle fibres (standard skeletal muscle).      Gamma (γ) motor neuron → goes to intrafusal muscle fibres (these give feedback on the dynamic state of the muscle).        Feedback from γ motor neurons go to the α motor neurons via 1a afferent fibres.  Intrafusal muscle fibres are specialized skeletal muscle fibres that serve as specialized sensory organs (proprioceptors) that detect the amount and rate of change in length of a muscle.  Motor Neurons      α motor neurons go to extrafusal muscle fibres (standard skeletal muscle).    γ motor neurons go to intrafusal muscle fibres (these have a proprioceptive function).  Spinal Reflexes  Spinal reflexes → neuron pathways that go exclusively through the spinal cord, and don’t go up to the brain.  We’ll be looking at 2 types of spinal reflexes.          Stretch reflexes.      Flexor withdrawal reflexes.      Stretch Reflex  Stretch reflex (myotactic reflex) → the intrinsic spinal cord reflex that are triggered when you stretch a muscle.          Function → this keeps the muscle at a constant length in response to a stretch (stretching causes a reflex that contracts the muscle to shorten it again).      Example → tapping the patellar tendon.      Mechanism:                  Stretching a muscle sends a signal up a 1a afferent to the spinal cord (eg. tapping the patellar tenton).          This then immediately synapses with an α motor neuron, which goes out to the synergistic muscle (eg. the knee extensors).          At the same time, the 1a afferent also synapses with an interneuron, which then has an inhibitory synapse with the antagonistic muscle (eg. to inhibit the action of the knee flexors). This prevents two opposing muscles from acting at the same time.                    Hence, the stretch reflex involves both a monosynaptic pathway (to the synergistic muscle), and a bisynaptic pathway (to the antagonistic muscle).        Central Control of Stretch Reflexes:          Your stretch reflexes are always activated by muscle stretch, but they’re normally suppressed by descending commands from the spinal cord. This is called cephalization (control by the brain).      These CNS inhibitory commands are much stronger than the reflex input to the α motor neurons.      With a CNS injury (loss of central suppression), these reflexes then become dominant.      This is why you get hyperreflexia with a CNS problem!        Why do LMN lesions cause a loss of the stretch reflex?          Here you disrupt the efferent fibres from the spinal cord, so the pathway is cut.      Flexor Withdrawal Reflex  Withdrawal Reflex (aka. nociceptive or flexor withdrawal reflex) → a spinal reflex that’s intended to protect the body from damaging stimuli.          Function → moves your body away from damaging (painful) stimuli.      Example → moving your hand away after touching a hot object.      Mechanism:                  Nociceptors send signals to the spinal cord in response to pain (nociceptors are sensory neuron receptors that are sensitive to pain).          This nociceptive input enters the marginal zone of the dorsal horn.          Through a series of interneurons, you have both an ipsilateral and contralateral response.          Ipsilaterally, you have flexor excitation and extensor inhibition, in order to move your limb away from the painful stimulus.          Contralaterally, if there’s a strong enough stimulation, you can also sometimes have extensor excitation and flexor inhibition, in order to extend your other limb.          This functions to keeps you balanced → if you withdraw your foot on one side, it’d make sense to extend your other one to stay on your feet.                      As with all reflexes, the flexor withdrawal reflex doesn’t require brain involvement.          However, the brain can function to suppress it (for instance, when experts walk across hot coals).        Summary of Reflexes      Stretch Reflex → functions to keep your muscle length constant.    Withdrawal Reflex → functions to move your body away from pain.  Descending Motor PathwaysDESCENDING MOTOR PATHWAYS.CORTICOSPINAL PATHWAY- Corticospinal tract, carries information from motor cortex to spinal cord.	- PMC -&gt; Internal capsule -&gt; midbrain (cerebral peduncles) -&gt; pons -&gt; medulla (pyramids) -&gt; corticospinal tracts.	- Recall decussation at pyramidal decussation.		- 85% cross at pyramidal decussation, to become the LATERAL CORTICOSPINAL TRACT, contralateral info from cortex.		- 15% don’t cross, to become the ANTERIOR CORTICOSPINAL TRACT, ipsilateral info from cortex.	- Recall cerebral peduncles contain:		1. Cerebrospinal tract.		2. Corticopontocerebellar pathway, doesn’t go past pons, turns into cerebellum.- Most axons in the corticospinal tract decussate (cross).TERMINATION.LATERAL CORTICOSPINAL TRACT- A lot terminate directly at lower motor neurons, thought to be for more precise movements.- Others go through interneurons.ANTERIOR CORTICOSPINAL TRACT- Here, MOST these will cross at the level of the spinal cord, vs. the pyramidal decussation, to get to the contralateral side.- Very few will stay on the ipsilateral side to innervate motor neurons.- IGNORE ALL THIS SHITTTT.Corrollary:Any spinal cord damage between decussation and termination will cause mainly ipsilateral weakness.Any damage above the pyramidal decussation will cause mainly contralateral weakness.WHY DOES AN UMN NOT CAUSE FLACCID PARALYSIS?- Reflex pathway (just a loop through the spinal cord) maintained, so you still have some output to the muscles. Prevents atrophy too.- Clinically, spasticity results from the loss of inhibition of motor neurons by CNS, causing excessive muscle contraction. Unopposed spinal reflexes.CORTICOBULBAR PATHWAYCorticobulbar tractLike corticospinal tract.Except only to motor cranial nuclei, except for III.Difference is that most of your face movements are bilateral.These distribute to both the ipsilateral and contralateral cranial nuclei, unlike the corticospinal tract, which mainly distributes to the contralateral nuclei.Exception: lower facial muscles of 7 contralateral only, EXCEPT FOR FOREHEAD, hehehe	- This is why lower facial muscle palsy is a common finding with strokes.	- RECALL THAT THIS =/= BELL’S PALSY because the forehead is supplied by both hemispheres	- CNS = forehead spared.	- Hence a UMN problem that affects one side of the corticobulbar tract will cause drooping of the lower facial muscles on the opposite side, but will spare the forehead.	- A facial nerve problem (Bell’s palsy) will affect the entire IPSILATERAL side.RETICULOSPINAL PATHWAY- More diffuse system, more responsible for muscle tone on a second to second basis.- Not somatopically organized like the corticospinal tract (primary motor cortex).- Multiple sensory inputs, go into system, to affect tone.- RETICULAR FORMATION throughout brainstem.- Not called nuclei, located in brainstem where lots of fibres passing through; doesn’t have a compact nuclear formation. Diffuse neuronal bodies.- Don’t need to know all these interconnections.- Pontine reticular = ipsilateral, medullary reticular = bilateral.- To ventral horn of spinal cord, but never directly to alpha motor neuron.	- Since doesn’t require precise, fine movement.	- Always through interneuron.LATERAL VESTIBULOSPINAL PATHWAY- Balance.- CN VIII input goes into lateral vestibular nucleus.- Sends output down to spinal cord, excitatory to extensor muscles.- Makes sure that there’s always tone in extensors appropriate to what you’re doing.- Prevents you from falling over, keeps you balanced.  Lot of input from higher levels (cerebellar, etc).  Removal of higher inputs to lateral vesetibular nucleus, end up with rigidity in limbs due to excessive extensor excitation.          Decereberate rigidity.IPSILATERAL       The vestibulospinal pathway sends commands for muscle tone andactivation of extensor muscles of the trunk and limb to maintain balance. Neurons are located in the lateral vestibular nucleus. The pathway descends ipsilaterally to the ventral horn of the spinal cordand terminates on interneurons that synapse with motor neuronsinnervating extensor muscles. The vestibular nucleus receives considerable modulation from higher braincentres as well as substantial input from the cerebellum. A lesion above the lateral vestibular nucleus results in a continuous state ofcontraction of the extensor muscles of the limbs, a condition known asdecerebrate rigidity. SUMMARY OF MOTOR CONTROLRegulatory loops.- Basal ganglia regulation -&gt; initation and tuning of motor actions.- Cerebellum -&gt; smoothing and coordination of muscle movements.- Cerebral cortex = contralateral.- Cerebellum = ipsilateral.- Recall spinocerebellar afferents (proprioception), go up to ipsilateral cerebellum.picture!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/23/descending-motor-pathways.html"},
	{"title": "Neurophysiology of the Association Cortex", "text": "  In humans, association areas take up the majority of the cerebral cortex.  Will discuss memory.  A sensorimotor hierarchy within the cerebral cortex.          eg. progression from optic nerve -&gt; thalamus -&gt; primary sensory cortex.      eg. progression down.      In rats, the primary motor and sensory areas occupy nearly ALL of the cortex.      In humans, this is only a small part of the cortex.        Higher order:          Premotor (blue)      Higher order sensory areas (somatosensory association cortex, visual association cortex, etc), make sense of the visual information.      eg. V2, V3, dorsal and ventral streams of extra striate cortex.        PURPLE = assocation areas.          Takes up 80% of the cortex in humans.      This is where:                  Information from different sensory modalities is integrated.          Attention is shifted.          Planning occurs and decisions are made.          Things are remembered.                    Multisensory integration (PMAA), multiple sensations are integrated into a single perception of what’s going on.        Association areas that we will go into:          Prefrontal Cortex.      Prefrontal Cortex  With evolution, the prefrontal cortex has become larger as a percentage of total brain size.  Functions of the prefrontal cortex:          Spatial Working Memory:                  Example: the cups game, where you hide a rock in one cup, and you have to remember where it is.          Very young children with a less developed prefrontal cortex, or patients with prefrontal lesions, will have deficits in this task.          Patients with prefrontal lesions will have difficulties remembering where they put their keys, or where things are placed in space.                    Rule Based Behaviour:                  Rule based behaviour involves remembering and implementing rules. This is key to having context-dependent behaviour.          For example: “red = stop, green = go”.          The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task is a common test of a patient’s rule based behaviour skills. As with spatial working memory, patients with prefrontal lesions are deficient in this task. {IMG} -&gt; Wisconsin Card Sorting Task                    Decision Making:                  The prefrontal cortex is involved in making decisions, and assessing the outcomes of these decisions.          After prefrontal lesions, patients displayed no anger after mistakes.          Because of this calming effect, frontal lobotomies used to be used as a popular cure for aggression.          Unforunately, this also destroyed their ability to make decisions, and to have initiative (neat).                      Lobotomy → invented by a portugese neurologist called Antonio Egas Moniz, who actually won a Nobel prize for inventing it.          Dr. Walter Freeman popularized it in the US.      A frontal lobotomy involved using an ice pick to go through the back of the eye-socket, and damaging the white matter connections in the prefrontal cortex.      Was used for aggression and emotional/psychiatric disorders.        Functions of the Prefrontal Cortex      Spatial working memory → remembering where things are placed in space.    Rule Based Behaviour → the ability to remember and implement a rule.    Decision making → not only the ability to make decisions, but also the ability to assess the outcome of your decisions (eg. anger/happiness).  Parietal-Temporal-Occipital (PTO) Cortex  Located in front of the visual cortex, and behind the somatosensory cortex (see right).  Functions of the parietal-temporal-occipital cortex          Multisensory Integration: Recall that you are left/right dominant depending on the location of Wernicke’s area in the R/L area respectively. Most people are right dominant (language interpretation is on the L side).                  Right side → the spatial location of objects by touch, sight, or sound          Left side → the sounds of words, written words (sight) or Braille (touch). Location depends on dominant hemisphere.          R more spatially oriented usually; L more language oriented.                    Attention:                  The parietal cortex enables us to focus on some objects and neglect others.          Allows us to filter out some sensory information to focus on others.          Patients with parietal strokes often have attention deficits; this is why neglect is such a common finding after a stroke.                    Memory:                  The inferior temporal lobe is involved in long‐term memory. We will look at this shortly.                      Can you spot what changes in this picture?          The ‘spotlight’ of attention.      Bunch of information comes in, can’t perceive everything. = change blindness.      Instead, we only perceive what we pay attention to, and in a complex scene, we cannot attend to everything at once. Our attention moves around like a spotlight to different parts of the scene.      At best, we can only attend to 3-5 objects at once.        INATTENTION BLINDNESS          A related phenomenon is called inattention blindness      For example, researchers questioned students who were talking on their cell phones while walking past a unicycling clown      They were twice as likely to not notice the clown as those not using cell phone      Inattention causes neglect!      NEGLECT = the converse of attention.One of the most common findings with a parietal stroke, affecting the PTO area (parietal-temporal-occipital area).A lesion of the right parietal cortex causespatients to neglect the left half of objects,regardless of where an object appears relativeto the line of sight (this is not a visual fielddeficit, as would happen after a right V1 lesion)Patients will also neglect their own body, forexample only shaving the right side of theirface, or dressing only the right side of theirbodyNEGLECT THE LEFT HALF OF THINGS, not because of sensory or motor deficits.See recovery over 1.5 months, but still problems on L side..Lesion on R side will cause L neglect, but NOT VICE VERSANeglect is lateralized.Common after R parietal strokes, but not L parietal strokes.Lesions of the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) cause neglect of the left sideof objectsSurprisingly, lesions of the left PPC do not cause neglect of the right side ofobjects. Why is this?Imaging experiments show that brain activity is distributed bilaterally to both PPCwhen attention is deployed to the right, but distributed unilaterally in the right PPCwhen attention is deployed to the left.The right PPC can deploy attention to the right or left of objectsLATERALIZATIONMany higher brain functions are lateralized to one hemisphere or another. Ourassociation cortices are not simply mirror images of each other“Dominant” hemisphere(usually the left) is moreimportant for sequential orserial tasks1) Language production andcomprehension2) Analytical math (e.g., A =B; B = C; thus A = C)“Non‐dominant” hemisphere(usually the right) is moreimportant for tasks requiringparallel processing:1) Spatial tasks and geometry2) MusicThe two hemispheres communicatethrough the corpus callosumSplit brain patientsCorpus callosum section -&gt; to prevent seizures in one side of brain from getting to other side.Imagine such a patient is shown an apple on theleft. This image is projected to the right cortex.The person can visually recognize the apple,and pick it out from other objects with the leftarm (since this is controlled by the right side ofthe brain)However, the person cannot name the applebecause it is not seen by the language center inthe left brainAlmost like two independent brains operatingin the same personSPLIT BRAINED!Myth: A common idea in popular culture is that “right‐brained” individuals aremore creative, and “left‐brained” individuals are more analyticalkernel of truth, hemispheres are lateralized, but not like this.Reality: The hemispheres operate together. In healthy people, the corpuscallosum ensures communication during the vast majority of tasks. As anexample, even though the left hemisphere is dominant for language, the righthemisphere is involved in processing intonation and emphasis. It’s not so simpleLanguage is the PROTOTYPICAL lateralized function.MemoryMemory: information that is stored (e.g., the memory of your grandmother), orthe structure that stores this information (e.g., synaptic strength in a particularpart of the brain)MemoryShort‐term/working memory Long‐term memoryReflexive/procedural DeclarativeLearning: the storage process that creates memories (e.g., how synaptic strengthis changed)Remembering: the retrieval of stored informationDifferent types of memory have different biological substrates.How is memory stored?How is memory retrieved?Reflexive/procedural = implicit.Declarative = explicit.SHORT TERM/WORKING MEMORY.‘scratch pad’ for temporary information storage.	storing numbers when adding	• storing words that one reads to form a	meaningful sentence	• Remembering the spatial location of objects	(e.g., pointing to remembered objects when	your eyes are closed)Requires PERSISTENT TONIC ACTIVITY in the FRONTAL LOBE (prefrontal cortex).

	{"title": "Ascending Sensory Pathways", "text": "Lecture Objectives  This lecture should integrate the material we’ve seen in previous lectures.  Name and describe the pathways for transmission of sensory information from the periphery to the termination in the spinal cord and brain.  Describe the sensory deficits due to lesions in the spinal cord, brain stem, diencephalon and cerebrum.Introduction  There are three main ascending sensory pathways in the spinal cord:          Dorsal Column, aka. the Medial Lemniscus Sensory System.      Spinothalamic and Spinoreticular Pathways.      Spinocerebellar Pathways.        Here, we’ll be focusing on the sensory innervation of the body; the sensory innervation to the head involves the cranial nerves, and not the spinal cord.Dorsal Column Pathway  Dorsal column → also known as the medial lemniscus.  The dorsal column contains fibres for the following sensory modalities:          Pressure      Discriminative touch (aka fine touch, conscious touch).      Vibration sense      Proprioception        The dorsal column does not cross at the level of the spinal cord.          This is an important differentiating feature from the spinothalamic tract.      Ascending nerves enter the dorsal funiculus without synapsing, and then enter the spinal cord.      The location at which there’s the first synapse is an important differentiating feature between ascending pathways:                  The medial meniscal system doesn’t synapse in the spinal cord; it just turns and ascends up.          The spinothalamic tract on the other hand synapses immediately upon entering.                    The organization of nerves in the dorsal column maintains a spatial organization all the way up to the cortex; this is known as somatotopy.                  Lower body information remains more medial in the gracile fasciculus.          Upper body information remains more lateral in the cuneate fasciculus.                    Sensory information from the head and neck enter the ventral posterior medial region of the thalamus, and thus isn’t a part of the dorsal column pathway (which is involved in sensation to the body).      Sensory information from the rest of the body enters the ventral posterior lateral region of the thalamus, which is a part of the dorsal column pathway.        What happens at the level of the brainstem?          The cuneate and gracile fasciculi terminate in the gracile nucleus and cuneate nucleus of the medulla.      This is where the FIRST SYNAPSE is.        After synapsing, the fibres then CROSS at the decussation of the medial lemniscus:          Recall that dorsal column = medial lemniscus.      The second order sensory neuron then continues, and terminates in the thalamus, in VPL (innervation to body).      The third order sensory neuron continues to innervate the postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex).        Corollaries:          Dorsal column sensory innervation is ipsilateral at the level of the spinal cord, but contralateral past the decussation of the medial lemniscus.      Hence we have that a:                  L sided medial lemniscus damage causes a R sided loss of dorsal column sensation.          L sided spinal cord damage causes a L sided loss of dorsal column sensation.                      Summary of the Dorsal Column      The dorsal column contains:              Discriminative Touch.        Pressure.        Vibration sense.        Proprioception.              Primary sensory neuron → ascends in the ipsilateral spinal cord WITHOUT SYNAPSING, and terminates at the gracile (lower body) and cuneate (upper body) nuclei of the medulla.    Secondary sensory neuron → leaves the gracile/cuneate nuclei, crosses at the decussation of the medial lemniscus, and goes to VPL.    Tertiary sensory neuron → leaves VPL, goes to the postcentral gyrus (where the primary somatosensory cortex is).    Gracile fasciculus = medial = lower extremities.    Cuneate fasciculus = lateral = upper extremities.       The cortical ‘space’ allocated to each part of the body correlates with their sensitivity:            However, this isn’t static; increased use of one region can result in increased sensitivity.      This is seen in braille readers, who rely on extended use of the somatosensory cortex in order to read braille.      Here, you see neuroplasticity; blind braille readers showed increased sensitivity in the hand that they used to read with.      Spinothalamic and Spinoreticular Pathways  These tracts carry the following sensory modalities:          Pain (nociception).      Temperature.        The spinothalamic/spinoreticular tract crosses at the level of the spinal cord:          Again, this differentiates these tracts from the dorsal column, which ascends without crossing.      Here, ascending fibres SYNAPSE IMMEDIATELY, at the dorsal horn.      Decussation then occurs immediately afterwards, at a region called the anterior white commisure.        Some fibres do not cross:          The vast majority of fibres synapse and cross at the level of the spinal cord, to become the lateral spinothalamic tract.      A minority of fibres synapse and stay on the ipsilateral side, to become the ventral/anterior spinothalamic tract.                  The lateral spinothalamic tract transmits pain and temperature.          The anterior spinothalamic tract transmits crude touch and firm pressure.                      Corollaries:          Hence, a lesion of the spinal cord will result in crossed sensory findings; a lesion on one side of the spinal cord will result in distal contralateral loss of pain/temperature, and an ipsilateral loss of vibration/proprioception.      However, a lesion in the brainstem (past where the dorsal column crosses) will result in contralateral findings for all sensory modalities.      This helps you localize an area of injury.        Destinations of spinothalamic/spinoreticular tracts:          Second order neurons:                  Some second order neurons terminate in VPL, of the thalamus.          Others actually terminate in the pulvinar or intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (recall that these were association nuclei).          Others go to the periaqueductal gray (responsible for pain suppression).          Finally, some (the ones involved in the spinoreticular tract) terminate in the reticular formation of the brainstem.                          The neurons of the reticular formation all play a crucial role in maintaining behavioral arousal and consciousness.                                           Third order neurons:                  Third order neurons distribute to primary and secondary/association sensory cortices (not just primary)          They also go to the cingulate &amp; insular cortex. Why?                          Pain is PAINFUL, and unpleasant. This response is due to integration in a different region of cortex.              The cingulate &amp; insular cortex are part of the limbic (emotional) system, and help us distinguish sensations as pleasant/unpleasant.                                            Summary of the Spinothalamic/Spinoreticular Tracts      The spinothalamic/spinoreticular tracts contain:              Pain (nociception).        Temperature.              Primary sensory neuron → enters the spinal cord, and synapses immediately.    Secondary sensory neuron → crosses at the anterior white commissure, and go to multiple destinations:              VPL of the thalamus.        Pulvinar and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus.        Periaqueductal gray (pain suppression).        Reticular formation (behaviour arousal + consciousness).              Tertiary sensory neuron → these leave the above destinations, and go to:              Primary sensory cortex (postcentral gyrus).        Secondary sensory areas (association areas).        Cingulate &amp; insular cortex (to distinguish pleasant/unpleasant sensations).                The cingulate/insular cortex response does not necessarily have to be due to direct pain:          You can actually feel unpleasant sensations due to empathy.      In one study, men were exposed to a painful stimuli, while their wives were undergoing fMRI.      Their cingulate/insular cortices showed activity suggesting that they felt their husband’s pain vicariously.      Interestingly, they never reversed the experiment (ie, subjecting the wives to pain while the husbands watched); they might not have had the same results!      Spinocerebellar Pathways  The spinocerebellar pathways play a role in subconscious proprioception:          This is your ‘innate limb position sense’, that never reaches the level of consciousness.      This is important in cerebellar smoothing and coordination of movement.      Note that this is different from conscious proprioception (‘yup, my thumb is sticking up’); but rather it’s the unconscious knowledge of where your body is in space.        As with the spinothalamic tract, ascending sensory fibres terminate immediately at the spinal cord:          They synapse at a deeper part of the dorsal horn than the spinothalamic tract, and then divert in two possible directions:                  Dorsal/posterior spinocerebellar tract → ascends straight up.          Ventral/anterior spinocerebellar tract → crosses over and ascends.                    This is important because the cerebellum, unlike the cortex, regulates the ipsilateral body.                  In other words, the R cerebellum coordinates movements for the R body, and vice versa.          Hence, the dorsal spinocerebellar tract is ascending on the ‘right’ side, but the ventral spinocerebellar tract is ascending on the ‘wrong’ side, and has to CROSS BACK (shown in green on the right).                      Corollary → some spinocerebellar routes are ipsilateral, while others are contralateral; so a one-sided spinal cord injury will not affect all proprioceptive fibres to the cerebellum.  Remember      Dorsal spinocerebellar tract ascends straight up.    Ventral spinocerebellar tract crosses over and then ascends.    Path of the spinocerebellar tracts:          The dorsal spinocerebellar tract enters at the inferior cerebellar peduncle (recall that this communicates to the cerebellum info about what your body is doing).      The ventral spinocerebellar tract enters at the superior cerebellar peduncle, and then crosses back to the ipsilateral side.      As mentioned before, this is because the ventral spinocerebellar tract has to cross back to end up on the right side of the cerebellum.      Both terminate in the spinocerebellum (vermis + intermediate hemisphere).        Summary of Pathways into the Cerebellum:          The middle cerebellar peduncle receives motor innervation from the primary motor cortex via the corticopontocerebellar pathway.                  Since the the cortex affects the contralateral body, while the cerebellum affects the ipsilateral body, these fibres must cross at the pons.                    The inferior cerebellar peduncle recveives proprioceptive info from the ipsilateral branches of the spinocerebellar pathways (the dorsal spinocerebellar tract).      The superior cerebellar peduncle receives proprioceptive info from the contralateral branches of the spioncerebellar pathways (the ventral spinocerebellar tract).      Descending info from the cortex tells the cerebellum ‘what was the order?’; ascending proprioceptive info from the spinal cord tells the cerebellum ‘where are you in space right now?’        Summary of the Spinocerebellar Pathways      The spinocerebellar pathways contain subconscious proprioception which is carried to the cerebellum.    Primary sensory neuron → enters the spinal cord, and synapses immediately.    Secondary sensory neuron → travel in 2 pathways:              Dorsal spinocerebellar tract → ascends ipsilaterally, and enters the inferior cerebellar peduncle.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cerebellum &amp; Spinal Cord", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Know the main structures and connections of the cerebellum.  Know the cross-sectional anatomy of the spinal cord, including the differences at each level and the sensory and motor input and output organization.  Describe monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes. Review from Previous Lectures  CNS participants in the command of motor actions.          Ideomotor area (in the PMAA).      Premotor Cortex.      Primary Motor Cortex.      Basal ganglia.      Cerebellum.      Spinal reflexes.        The cerebellum is what we’ll be focusing on today.  In addition to the basal ganglia, the cerebellum acts as another regulatory centre for the motor cortex.          The basal ganglia is used to regulate the initation of actions, and tune motor cortex activity. For example, it’s used to make sure you use the right amount of force when picking up eggshells vs. picking up a rock.      The cerebellum is used to smooth and coordinate movement.        We saw the mechanism behind basal ganglia regulation in Basal Ganglia &amp; Diencephalon, via the direct/indirect striopallidal pathway.          Direct striopallidal pathway → feed-forward.      Indirect striopallidal pathway → inhibitory.        Today we’ll be looking at pathways involving the cerebellum.The CerebellumIntroduction to the Cerebellum  As mentioned before, the cerebellum plays a role in SMOOTHING and COORDINATING movement.          It acts to regulate the primary motor cortex, in addition to the basal ganglia.      Without the action of the cerebellum, you can have problems with balance, smooth motion, and fine movement.        What information would the cerebellum need to coordinate movement?          What is the command?                  This is information from the primary motor cortex.          This information gets into the cerebellum via the corticopontocerebellar pathway which we saw yesterday.          Recall that this was a pathway from the motor cortex → internal capsule → cerebral peduncle → pontine nuclei → middle cerebellar peduncle → cerebellum.                    How is your body moving with respect to itself?                  This is proprioception information, which comes from the spinal cord.          Proprioception can be divided into 2 categories: conscious and unconscious.                          Conscious proprioception needs to go through the cortex.              Unconscious proprioception doesn’t need to (it can just go into the cerebellum).                                The proprioception information that the cerebellum needs is actually unconscious proprioception.                    How is your balance? → this is vestibular information.        Inputs to the cerebellum      In order to function properly, the cerebellum requires 3 inputs:              What is the command? → ie. input from the primary motor cortex.        How is your body moving with respect to itself? → ie. proprioception input from the spinal cord.        How is your balance? → ie. vestibular input.              In other words, we need:              Primary Motor Cortex Information.        Proprioception Information.        Vestibular Information.            Anatomy of the Cerebellum  Like the cortex, there is a thin layer of gray matter on the outside of the cerebellum, with white matter inside.          However, the cerebellum has much more regular and fine folds compared to the cerebral cortex.      It also has less white matter relative to gray matter; this white matter is known as the arbor vitae, because of it’s fine branching pattern (like the tree of life).        The cerebellum can be subdivided based on anatomy (into lobes), or based on function (into regions).  Anatomical Subdivision:          Lobes of the Cerebellum:                  Anterior lobe.          Posterior lobe.          Focculonodular lobe.                    The anterior lobe is separated from the posterior lobe by the primary fissure.      The flocculonodular lobe contains the flocculus and nodule      You can see these features below, where the cerebellum has been ‘flattened out’.                  Basically, if you note the c-shape drawn on the top-left, the flattened cerebellum has been formed by unfolding it so that the c is flat.                      Functional Subdivision:          With a functional subdivision of the cerebellum, instead of splitting it into lobes anteriorly to posteriorly, you split it into sections medially to laterally.      Regions of the Cerebellum:                  Vermis          Intermediate Hemisphere          Lateral Hemisphere                    This division relates to how information enters the cerebellum      Functional Divisions of the Cerebellum  As mentioned above, the cerebellum needs 3 inputs:          Primary Motor Cortex.      Proprioception.      Vestibular.        These 3 inputs correspond to 3 ‘destinations’ in the cerebellum:          Cerebrocerebellum → receives PMC input (from cerebrum).      Spinocerebellum → receives proprioception input (from spinal cord).      Vestibulocerebellum → receives vestibular input (from otolith organs).        These destinations are comprised of the functional regions we described above:          Cerebrocerebellum = lateral hemisphere.      Spinocerebellum = vermis + intermediate hemisphere.      Vestibulocerebellum = flocculonodular lobe.      Connections to the Cerebellum  As seen before, there are 3 connections between the cerebellum and the rest of the body:          Superior Cerebellar Peduncle → connects to MIDBRAIN &amp; DIENCEPHALON.      Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → connects to PONS.      Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle → connects to MEDULLA &amp; SPINAL CORD.        Each carries different information:          Superior Cerebellar Peduncle → carries OUTPUT from the cerebellum back into the thalamus (hence it conencts to the diencephalon). It also carries some proprioception information.      Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → carries INPUT from the primary motor cortex, via the corticopontocerebellar pathway.      Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle → carries INPUT from the medulla/spinal cord, concerning proprioception and balance.      Summary of the Cerebellum  The spinocerebellum is the vermis and intermediate hemispheres on the midline of the cerebellum whose primary input is from the spinal cord.  The cerebrocerebellum is the lateral hemisphere that receives input from the cerebral cortex via the corticopontocerebellar tract.  The vestibulocerebellum is the flocculonodular lobe that receives vestibular information from brain stem nuclei.  To coordinate and refine movements the cerebellum receives the necessary information from the motor cortex on what the command is (cerebrocerebellum). It can then compare this with where the body is in space, including limb position (spinocerebellum) as well as equilibrium and balance (vestibulocerebellum). Information is then sent back to the cerebral cortex to provide a correction to the command on a continuous basis.

The Spinal CordGross Anatomy of the Spinal Cord  Spinal cord → where the spinal nerves enter and exit.  The spinal cord travels through the vertebral foramina of the spinal vertebrae, and terminates at around L1-L2.  Past this point is the cauda equina; a diffuse projection of the remaining spinal nerves.  There is also a fibrous strand called the filum terminale, which affixes the end of the spinal cord to the coccyx.           The function of the filum terminale is to prevent the spinal cord from moving around.         The spinal cord consists of 31 spinal nerves → 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal.  There are two thicker regions of the spinal cord called the cervical and lumbar enlargements → this is where the nerves going out to the limbs originate (there’s more output to the limbs than the trunk).Cross-Section of the Spinal Cord  The gray matter of the spinal cord is located in a ‘butterfly’, or H-like arrangement in the centre, and contains neuronal cell bodies.  Surrounding that is white matter, which is comprised of fibres from this gray matter.          These fibres include both ascending sensory fibres, and descending motor fibres; we’ll be discussing these fibre pathways in more detail later.        The white matter on the lateral side is referred to as the lateral funiculus.  The white matter on the ventral side is referred to as the anterior funiculus.  Sensory Innervation          Sensory information enters the spinal nerves via the dorsal roots, which contain sensory information only.      Each dorsal root has a dorsal root ganglion, which is comprised of the cell bodies of all the unipolar sensory neurons.      Before the dorsal root enters the spinal cord, it splits into multiple dorsal root filaments.      Some of these afferent sensory fibres will terminate at the dorsal horn; others will ascend straight up without synapsing.        Motor Innervation          Motor (both somatomotor and visceral motor) information leaves the spinal cord via ventral roots, which arise from multiple ventral root filaments.      Unlike the afferent sensory nerves, which have cell bodies within the dorsal root ganglion, the efferent motor nerves have cell bodies in the ventral horn (the ‘anterior horn cells’).        The dorsal and ventral roots combine to form the spinal nerves.          Each spinal nerve then splits into a dorsal rami and a ventral rami.      Unlike the dorsal and ventral roots, the dorsal and ventral rami aren’t sensory or motor specific; they contain a mix of sensory and motor innervation.      Instead, they’re region specific:                  Dorsal rami → dorsal body.          Ventral rami → ventral body (much thicker since includes limbs)                      Remember      The dorsal root contains sensory information    The ventral root contains motor information.    The dorsal root nerves have cell bodies outside the spinal cord, in the dorsal root ganglia.    The ventral root nerves have cell bodies inside the spinal cord, in the ventral horn (ie. anterior horn cells).    The dorsal and ventral roots merge to form spinal nerves, which then split into dorsal and ventral rami.  The Thoracic Spinal Cord  Recall that the sympathetic chain (aka. sympathetic trunk) runs only from T1 to L2.  In this area, the ‘H-shaped’ gray matter looks a little different.          There’s a little bump of gray matter on the ‘sides’ of the H, which is where the cell bodies for sympathetic outflow are located (see below).      This is known as the intermediolateral nucleus (IML), also known as the lateral horn, or Rexed lamina VII.        Note that this is only present from T1 to L2, where the sympathetic chain runs.  Sympathetic outflow does not go directly to end-organs:          Instead, they synapse first.      After they leave the spinal cord in the ventral root, they then deviate and go through rami communicantes into the sympathetic ganglia.      At the sympathetic ganglia, they synapse, and then go back to rejoin the dorsal and ventral rami.      After this, they then provide sympathetic output to skin and muscle.        Remember      The preganglionic sympathetic neuron starts in the lateral horn (between T1 and L2), travels through the rami communicantes and synapses at the sympathetic ganglion.    The postganglionic sympathetic neuron starts at the sympathetic ganglion, goes back to the dorsal and ventral rami, and innervates end targets.    Why is there no ventral root ganglion?          As mentioned before, the afferent sensory fibres have cell bodies outside the spinal cord, in the dorsal root ganglion.      On the other hand, the efferent motor fibres have cell bodies in the ventral horn, so there’s no corresponding ventral root ganglion. The only thing that runs in the ventral horns are the axons.      Regions of the Spinal CordWhite Matter  Posteriorly, we have the dorsal funiculus, which contains ascending sensory information from the ‘dorsal column tract’.          The dorsal funiculus has two parts: the (1) gracile fasciculus medially, and the (2) cuneate fasciculus laterally.  Since the lower limbs are less sensitive, the gracile fasciculus has fewer sensory fibres and is thus thinner. This is why it’s called the ‘gracile’ (slender) fasciculus.      The gracile fasciculus contains ascending sensory information from the lower limbs; the cuneate fasciculus contains ascending information from the upper limbs.        Anteriorly, we have the ventral funiculus, which contains some descending motor fibres.Gray Matter  Dorsal horn → where some dorsal roots terminate.  Ventral horn → where the motor neuron cell bodies are.  Lateral horn → as mentioned before, this is only from T1-L2, where the sympathetic chain is located.          Contains (preganglionic) cell bodies for sympathetic outflow, which then synapse in the sympathetic chain.        Intermediate zone → contains interneurons which mediate connections between sensory and motor neurons within the spinal cord.  Just like with Brodmann’s areas, Anatomists (they have no life!) have subdivided the gray matter of the spinal cord into different cellularly disinct regions.          These are the Lamina of Rexed, and there are 10 different lamina, which correspond to different nuclei.      These aren’t important to know.      Variations throughout the Spinal Cord  Sections associated with the limbs have greater amountof gray matter (these were the cervical and lumbar enlargements)  White matter decreases from rostral to caudal → fewerdescending and ascending fiber fibers.          This makes sense, since at any point, the spinal cord contains ascending and descending information for anything below that level.      So at the bottom, there’s little information going up or down, while at the top, there’s a lot.        Gray matter of T1 to L2 has a lateral horn          Recall that this was where the sympathetic preganglionic neurons originate.      Also called the intermediolateral nucleus.        Summary      The cuneate and gracile fasciculi together are known as the dorsal or posterior funiculus.    The fibre tracts at the base of the spinal cord are the ventral or anterior funiculus.    Sensory input terminates in the dorsal horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord.    Somatic motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of the gray matter.    Interneurons are located in the intermediate zone of the gray matter.    The spinal canal continuous with 4th ventricle.    There is decreasing white matter caudally in the spinal cord.

The eye is largely held in the bony orbit by a large amount of fat.  Muscles also help keep the eye in place (the extra-ocular eye muscles).Bones of the Orbit  Objective      Name the bones that form the walls of the orbit and state susceptibility to fracture.    Frontal Bone → roof.  Maxilla → floor.          The maxillary sinus lies right below the orbit; hence the floor of the orbit is quite thin.      Hence, the floor of the orbit is highly susceptible to fracture.        Ethmoid  Recall that this was in the anterior cranial cavity, and included the cribriform plate and the crista galli.          Forms part of the medial wall of the orbit, and is also highly susceptible to fracture. This part is called the lamina papyracea (paper thin), aka the orbital lamina of the ethmoid.        Sphenoid          Both the lesser and greater wing of the sphenoid are represented on the lateral wall, with a slit between them called the superior orbital fissure.      Recall from Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity 2 that the CN III, IV, V1, and VI travel through here. That is, the 3 motor nerves to the eye + the sensory innervation to the ophthalmic region.      We also see a hole in the lesser wing of the sphenoid, the optic canal; this is where the optic nerve goes through.        Zygomatic Bone → Forms the lateral-most margin of the orbit.  Lacrimal          A tiny bone on the medial side of the orbit with a hole that drains into the nose (the nasolacrimal duct).      Drains into the inferior meatus along the lateral nasal wall.      This is why your nose gets stuffy when you cry!        Bones of the Orbit      Roof → frontal bone.    Floor → maxillary bone.    Medial wall → ethmoid (lamina papyracea), lacrimal, maxillary bone.    Lateral wall → zygomatic bone, sphenoid (greater + lesser wing).    Weak Points in the Orbit:              Maxilla → thin due to the presence of the maxillary sinus immediately below.        Lamina Papyracea → thin bone, part of ethmoid, on medial side of orbit.            Blowout Fractures  Direct trauma to the orbital bones is rare; more often, fractures occur due to indirect trauma to the head.  Indirect blows that displace the orbital walls will often result in a fracture of the weak parts of the orbit.  This can result in:          Medial wall blowout fracture (fracture at the lamina papyracea).      Inferior wall blowout fracture (fracture of the maxilla above the maxillary sinus).        With an inferior wall blowout fracture, you can often see the fat surrounding the orbit herniate into the maxillary sinus.          This is known as a teardrop sign (can see this on the CT on the right).      The Lacrimal Apparatus  Lacrimal fluid (tears) is formed by the lacrimal gland.          This is an almond shaped gland located in the lateral part of the orbit, just beneath the frontal bone, and just above the eyeball.        By blinking, we spread this lacrimal fluid across the cornea, laterally to medially.  On the medial side, this fluid drains into the nasal cavities via the nasolacrimal duct.          This fluid enters the duct via superior and inferior puncta, which carry fluid into the superior and inferior canaliculi, and then into the lacrimal sac.      Muscles of the Orbit  7 extraocular muscles:          1 eyelid muscle → levator palpebrae superioris.      4 recti muscles → superior, inferior, medial, lateral.      2 oblique muscles → superior, inferior.        These function to move the eye within the orbit, or elevate the eyelid (levator palpebrae superioris).  Movements of the eye include:          Elevation      Depression      ADduction.      ABduction      Internal Rotation.      External Rotation.        Positions of the Extraocular Muscles:            The superior, inferior, medial, and lateral recti attach where you’d expect them to attach; onto the superior, inferior, medial, and lateral eye.      The superior oblique and the inferior oblique, as their names suggest, attach to the eye obliquely.      Note that the superior oblique wraps around a ‘sling’ called the trochlea, which reverses the direction of its muscles fibres.      As a result, when it pulls, it moves in the opposite direction as what you’d expect given it’s origin and attachment.      In other words, although it attaches to a similar location as the superior rectus, it actually antagonizes the superior rectus.      Something similar happens with the inferior oblique, which wraps around the eye, and antagonizes the action of the inferior rectus.        Actions of the Extraocular Muscles:            You’d think that this is straightforward; since the superior rectus attaches to the top of the eye, it should elevate it!      But it’s actually a (little bit) more complicated, because the axis of the orbit and the axis of the eye are not the same. There is actually a 23° degree difference between the two.        Since the extraocular muscles originate at the orbit, and attach to the eye, they don’t pull along the axis of the eye.                   The end result of this is that the superior and inferior rectus also function to adduct the eye, and the superior and inferior oblique also function to abduct the eye.                    Hence, their true functions are as follows:                  Superior Rectus → elevate and adduct eye.          Inferior Rectus → depress and adduct eye.          Lateral Rectus → abduction of the eye.          Medial Rectus → adduction of the eye.          Superior Oblique → depress and abduct eye (ANTAGONIZES SUPERIOR RECTUS)          Inferior Oblique → elevate and abduct eye (ANTAGONIZES INFERIOR RECTUS)                    What about the Levator Palpebrae Superioris?                    The levator palpebrae superioris attaches to the tarsal plate (cartilage of the eyelid) and does exactly what its name suggests; it raises the eyelid.          Interestingly, there is a conjoint tendon between the superior rectus and the levator palpebrae.          Hence, when you look up, you also have activation of the levator palpebrae superioris in addition to the superior rectus.          This prevents you from seeing the back of your eyelid!                      Motor innervation of the Extraocular Muscles:          Everything is innervated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III), with TWO EXCEPTIONS:                  Superior Oblique, which is innervated by CN IV (Trochlear).          Lateral Rectus, which is innervated by CN VI (Abducens).                    These are easy to remember, the superior oblique goes through the trochlea, hence ‘trochlear nerve’, and the lateral rectus abducts the eye, hence ‘abducens nerve’.      The rest of the muscles (superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris) are all done by CN III.      Testing the Extraocular Muscles  Testing the extraocular muscles is more difficult than just moving the eye in the direction of each of the muscle actions.          This is because there is redundant action between extraocular muscles, so this would not isolate the muscle of interest.      For example, if you tried to test the superior oblique by asking a patient to depress and abduct their eye, you won’t be sure if their ability to depress the eye is due to the inferior rectus or the superior oblique.        To resolve this, you have to eliminate the action of the redundant muscle:          Using the same example as above, suppose we’re assessing the action of the superior oblique:                  The superior oblique does depression + abduction.          The inferior rectus does depression + adduction.                    To eliminate the downward pull of the IR, you can adduct the eye:                  This brings the axis of the eye in line with the axis of the pulling force of the SO, so it will override the downward pull of the IR.          Now, when you depress the eye, you can be sure that this depression is primarily due to the action of the SO.                        This is reflected in the figure to the right; when you’re testing the muscles that attach above or below the eye, you actually move the eye in a direction that differs from their action.          You can remember the directions for testing by imagining that you’re flipping the actions in a mirror; everything is still the same vertically, but things are transposed horizontally.

Inferior oblique has the opposite function as the inferior rectus.  Nerves of the Orbit  Sight → Optic Nerve (CN II)  Motor to Extraocular Muscles:          Trochlear Nerve (CN IV) → superior oblique.      Abducens Nerve (CN VI) → lateral rectus.      Oculomotor Nerve (CN III) → everything else.        Sensory to Orbit → Ophthalmic nerve = V1 branch of the trigeminal.            Recall that the 3 branches of the trigeminal were the ophthalmic, maxillary, and submandibular branches.      V1 (the ophthalmic branch) then gives off 3 main sub-branches:                  Frontal          Lacrimal          Nasociliary                    Cranial Nerve Palsies to the Eye  Oculomotor Nerve Palsy           Results in unopposed action of the trochlear nerve (superior oblique; down + out) and the abducens nerve (out).      Hence, patients with an oculomotor nerve palsy will present with a depressed, abducted eye on the affected side.      Will also have ptosis on the affected side without the action of the levator palpebrae superioris.        Trochlear Nerve Palsy           Commonly injured by trauma.      The trochlear nerve innervates the SO, responsible for depression + abduction.      Hence, a palsy would result in a baseline elevation + adduction of eye (an ‘up and in’ position).      Abduction would still be possible via the lateral rectus (abducens).        Abducens Nerve Palsy           Affects the lateral rectus, the main abductor of the eye.      Results in an inability to abduct, resulting in a characteristic head turn to avoid double vision.      Often seen injured with bad falls (causing increased intracranial pressure).      Arteries of the Orbit  The main artery to the orbit is the ophthalmic artery, off the internal carotid artery.          This branches off near where it emerges from the cavernous sinus, near the pituitary gland.      This runs in the optic canal with the optic nerve.        The opthalmic artery gives off a bunch of branches, which generally run with branches of the ophthalmic nerve.          These aren’t too important, except for one branch, the central retinal artery.      The central retinal artery is a tiny artery that goes into the dural sheath of the optic nerve, and intermingles with the fibres of the nerve.      It’s important because it’s the ONLY BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE EYE.      Hence, if something goes wrong with this artery, you go blind!      This is unlike most other key organs, where there is collateral circulation. With the eye, you only have one feeding vessel!        Remember      The central retinal artery is the ONLY blood supply to the eye!    Occlusion will thus lead to BLINDNESS.  Veins of the Orbit  With the venous drainage of the orbit, note that we have 2 ophthalmic veins (superior and inferior), as opposed to only 1 ophthalmic artery.          The superior ophthalmic vein runs through the superior orbital fissure, the inferior ophthalmic vein runs through the inferior orbital fissure.        Recall from Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity I, that the facial vein connects to the ophthalmic veins, and could become a route for infection.          Recall the DANGER TRIANGLE, where an infection can spread from the facial vein → ophthalmic veins → cavernous sinus → meningitis.        Review of the Cavernous Sinus            Recall that the ICA runs through the cavernous sinus (only part of the body where an artery runs through a vein).      The abducens runs right beside the ICA, while III, IV, V1 and V2 lie on the lateral walls.      An infection that tracks into the cavernous sinus can affect all of these nerves, although the abducens is usually affected first (since it lies inside the sinus).      Worsening infections can then involve III and IV, and can even affect the optic nerve (which lies above the sinus).      Hence, knowing the anatomy of the cavernous sinus is hugely clinically important.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/19/anatomy-orbit.html"},

Know the twelve cranial nerves, where they exit the brain and their normal function.  Be able to determine the major symptoms and signs of dysfunction resulting from lesions in the brain stem.The BrainstemSubdivisions of the Brainstem  Objective      Identify the 3 major subdivisions of the brainstem and describe the anatomic relationships of the major motor and sensory nuclei and the major descending and ascending tracts in the brainstem.    The brainstem, as the name suggests, sits at the base of the brain and connects it to the spinal cord.          The cranial nerves largely come out at the level of the brainstem.        Subdivisions of the brainstem:          Midbrain.      Pons.      Medulla (Oblongata).        The midbrain is located inferior to the thalamus, and posterior to the pituitary.          Running through the midbrain is the cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius), which connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle.      The third ventricle is the space between the two lobes of the thalamus.      The fourth ventricle is the space between the pons/medulla and the cerebellum, and is continuous with the spinal canal.        The pons is a bulbous projection off the ventral surface of the brainstem.  The medulla lies below the pons, and is continuous with the spinal cord.Anatomical Features of the BrainstemVentral Surface of the Brainstem  Olfaction and vision don’t go through the brainstem, however they are shown in the figure below to be running above it:          Olfactory tract → the afferent tract for olfactory information to reach the uncus (in the temporal lobe).                  Note that olfactory information isn’t relayed through the thalamus, recall from Basal Ganglia &amp; Diencephalon that olfaction was the ONLY sensory modality that didn’t.                    Optic tract → the afferent tract for visual information to reach the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.                  Recall that the optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, and when they branch off again, they’re referred to as the optic tract.                      Ventral Features at the Midbrain:          Cerebral peduncles → continuation of the internal capsule (these were the projection fibres to and from the deep gray matter). These carry information between the brain and the lower brainstem and spinal cord.      Partially covering the dorsal midbrain are mamillary bodies that project off the hypothalamus; these are part of the limbic system.        Ventral Features at the Pons:          There are lots of medial → lateral fibres wrapping around the pons, which reflects how information that reaches the pons reflects around to feed to the cerebellum.      Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → this is the connection between the pons &amp; cerebellum, carrying the information that came down from the cerebral peduncles from the primary motor cortex.                  This peduncle is the one that tells the cerebellum “what action is being done”, which helps the cerebellum coordinate your movements.                      Ventral Features at the Medulla:          The medulla is continuous with the spinal cord, so its main role is to communicate motor information from the brain down into the spinal cord.      On the ventral surface of the medulla, you can see the medullary pyramids, which contain the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts:                  Corticobulbar tract → carries motor information of the cranial nerves.          Corticospinal tract → carries motor information down the spinal cord to the rest of the body.          There are 2 medullary pyramids (L &amp; R), which are separated by a ventral median sulcus.                    At this level, the information in the corticospinal tract (which will go down the spinal cord) is uncrossed, even though the L hemisphere controls the R body.                  To ‘fix’ this, the information crosses at a midline feature called the pyramidal decussation.                    Finally, lateral to the pyramids are the olivary nuclei, which give into the cerebellum.      Dorsal Surface of the Brainstem  Dorsal Features above the Brainstem:          Parts of the thalamus, including:                  Lateral geniculate (visual relay).          Medial genicular (auditory relay).          Pulvinar nucleus of thalamus.                    Epithalamus (pineal gland).        Dorsal Features at the Midbrain:  Recall in Neurophysiology of the Visual Cortex that the superior colliculus was one of 2 destinations for optic tract axons other than the LGN. The other was the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which controls the pupillary light reflex.          Superior colliculus (x2) → receives direct visual information, and guides orientation &amp; reflex tracking of moving objects.      Inferior colliculus (x2) → receives direct auditory reflexes, and controlls auditory reflexes (eg. startle in response to a sudden sound).      Together, the superior and inferior colliculus are known as the corpora quadrigemina.      Superior Cerebellar Peduncle → one of 3 connections to the cerebellum.        Dorsal Features at the Pons:          Middle Cerebellar Peduncle → another of the 3 connections to the cerebellum.        Dorsal Features at the Medulla:          Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle → the last of the 3 connections to the cerebellum.      Gracile tubercle and cuneate tubercle → sensory relay nuclei from spinal cord.  This sensory information is fine touch, proprioception, and vibration sense ONLY; pain and temperature run in a different tract.                  the fibre tracts carrying the corresponding neurons are the cuneate + gracile fasciculus.          As we’ll see in a later lecture (Ascending Sensory Pathways), the gracile fasciculus carries lower body sensory information, and the cuneate fasciculus carries upper body sensory information.                      The cerebellar peduncles:          As mentioned above, there are 3 cerebellar peduncles, that are responsible for connecting the cerebellum to the rest of the brain.                  Superior cerebellar peduncle → connects cerebellum to midbrain and diencephalon.          Middle cerebellar peduncle → connects cerebellum to pons.          Inferior cerebellar peduncle → connects cerebellum to medulla and spinal cord.                    We’ll see in a later lecture (Ascending Sensory Pathways), that each of these 3 peduncles carry different information.      As a brief summary:  The superior cerebellar peduncle also carries some proprioceptive information, as we’ll see later.                  The superior cerebellar peduncle takes OUTPUT from the cerebellum back to the cortex.          The middle cerebellar peduncle takes INPUT from the primary motor cortex (“what was the order?”)          The inferior cerebellar peduncle takes INPUT from vestibular and some proprioceptive sources (“what is my balance like? Where am I in space?”).                    Summary of Features of the Brainstem  Midbrain → the midbrain mainly functions to relay information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, via the cerebral peduncles.          Also present are the superior and inferior colliculi, which receive direct visual and auditory information, respectively.        Pons → the pons mainly functions to relay motor output from the brain into the cerebellum via the middle cerebral peduncle:          As we’ll see later, it is part of a pathway called the corticopontocerebellar pathway, which is exactly what it sounds like.        Medulla → the medulla is continuous with the brainstem, so its dorsal side mostly functions to carry sensory information up, and its ventral side mostly functions to carry motor information down.          Sensory information is carried up by the gracile (medial) and cuneate (lateral) fasciculi.      Motor information is carried down by the corticospinal tracts, which cross at the pyramidal decussation.

Cranial NervesExits of the Cranial Nerves  The exits of the cranial nerves are as follows:          Above Brainstem → I, II.      Midbrain → III, IV.      Pons → V, VI, VII, VIII.      Medulla → IX, X, XII.  It’s easy to remember that XI comes off the spinal cord because the nerve itself is called the SPINAL accessory nerve.      Spinal Cord → XI.        A screening neurological exam, which covers II, III, IV, VI, IX, X, XII, includes at least 1 cranial nerve from each of the midbrain/pons/medulla.          Hence, even though you don’t cover all the cranial nerves, you still have enough information for localization.        More specifically, their exits are as follows:          III comes off the ventral midbrain.      IV comes off the dorsal midbrain, and reflects to the ventral side.      V comes off the pons proper.      VI, VII, VIII come off the interface between the pons and medulla (medially to laterally).      IX, X, XI come off in a row along the medulla &amp; spinal cord (superiorly to inferiorly).      XII comes off the medulla medial to the IX, X, XI row.        Exits of the Cranial Nerves      Above Brainstem → I, II.    Midbrain → III, IV.    Pons → V, VI, VII, VIII.    Medulla → IX, X, XII    Spinal Cord → XI.  Functions of the Cranial Nerves  The optic nerve is considered to the part of the CNS, since it is derived from the diencephalon during fetal development:          As a result, the nerve fibers are covered by myelin produced by oligodendrocytes rather than Schwann cells (of the peripheral nervous system).       The nerve is actually encased by the dura and pia- arachnoid membranes and lies within the subarachnoid space.       Also, neuropathies that only effect the peripheral nervous system, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, do not affect the optic nerve.        Remember      The optic nerve is considered to be part of the CNS.  Cross-Sections of the BrainstemCross Section of the Midbrain  Below is a cross section of the midbrain, at the level of the inferior colliculi (recall, these receive direct auditory information).          On the dorsal side, you can see the inferior colliculi.      On the ventral side, you can see the cerebral peduncles, which as we said, was an extension of the internal capsule.      We also see CN III exiting the midbrain (III &amp; IV exit midbrain).        Note that the substantia nigra is part of the midbrain; we saw that this projected dopamingeric innervation to the striatum of the basal ganglia, and was affected in Parkinson’s.  Around the cerebral aqueduct (which connects the 3rd and 4th ventricles), is an aptly named periaqueductal gray:          As the name suggests, this is gray matter around the cerebral aqueduct.      It plays an important role in pain suppression at the level of the spinal cord.        Of less importance is the red nucleus, which plays a minor role in motor control.  There are also lots of other small nuclei related to cranial nerve input and output.Cross Section of the Pons  Below is a cross section of the pons, bisecting the cerebellum.          Between the pons and cerebellum you can see a gap; this is the 4th ventricle.      In addition, you can see parts of all 3 of the cerebellar peduncles:                  Superior cerebellar peduncle coming from the diencephalon &amp; midbrain.          Middle cerebellar peduncle coming from the pons.          Inferior cerebellar peduncle coming from the medulla &amp; spinal cord.                      Here you also see the corticospinal tract; this is a continuation from the cerebral peduncle carrying motor information to the rest of the body.          Note that the corticospinal tract is much smaller than the cerebral peduncle; this is because a lot of the fibres have terminated!      These other fibres end at the pontine nuclei, synapse in the pons, and then travel along the middle cerebellar peduncle into the cerebellum.      This is part of the corticopontocerebellar pathway.        The Corticopontocerebellar Pathway      Motor information travelling down the cerebral peduncle either:              Continues down to the rest of the body via the corticospinal tract.        Goes into the cerebellum to control balance/coordination via the corticopontocerebellar pathway.              The corticopontocerebellar pathway is a 2 neuron pathway:              Primary neuron → starts at the primary motor cortex, travels down the cerebral peduncle, and synapses with the pontine nuclei.        Secondary neuron → travels from the pontine nuclei, decussates (crosses), goes into the middle cerebellar peduncle, and enters the cerebellum.              Cross Section of the Medulla  Dorsal Side:          Gracile nucleus → point of termination for lower limb (dorsal column) somatosensory information coming up from the spinal cord.      Cuneate nucleus → point of termination for upper limb (dorsal column) somatosensory information coming up from the spinal cord.        Ventral Side:          Pyramid → comprises the fibres of the corticospinal tract and the corticobulbar tract, above the level of the pyramidal decussation (where the fibres cross to the contralateral side).      Olivary nucleus → lateral to pyramid, recall that we said that this gives input to the cerebellum.      CN XII → recall that we mentioned that this did not run in that row along the side of the medulla/spinal cord with IX, X, and XI. This is more medial, as shown here.        In addition there are visceral sensory &amp; motor nuclei here.  Summary      Scattered throughout the brain stem is a large collection of neurons known as the reticular formation. The reticular formation does not form discrete nuclei. Based on the location in the brain stem, the reticular formation can participate in several functions, including control of movement, modulation of pain, autonomic reflexes and arousal.    There is also a large amount of white matter in the brain stem consisting of pathways for brain stem connections as well as pathways for axons connecting the forebrain (cerebrum and diencephalon) with the spinal cord.    Midbrain Cross-Section      The inferior and superior colliculi (auditory and visual reflexes) are seen as large nuclei in the dorsal region of the midbrain.    The periaqueductal gray is a large collection of neurons surrounding the cerebral aqueduct (connects the III and IV ventricles). The periaqueductal gray is involved in suppression of pain and autonomic responses.    The red nucleus is another large group of neurons observed ventrally in the midbrain and is involved in flexion movement of the limbs.    Immediately dorsal to the cerebral peduncles is the substantia nigra that contains the dopamine neurons that terminate in the striatum.    Pons Cross-Section      The pontine nuclei are seen as a very large collection of nuclei in the ventral pons.    The corticospinal tract is located within the pontine nuclei. It is much smaller than the cerebral peduncle in the midbrain since many of the axons have terminated in the pontine nuclei.    The corticopontocerebellar pathway is an important pathway for motor control.               One set of neurons originates in the motor region of the cerebral cortex and project to the pontine nuclei via the internal capsule (diencephalon) and then via the cerebral peduncles (midbrain).         In the pontine nuclei there is a synapse onto a second set of neurons that first decussates (crosses the midline) and then enters the cerebellum via the middles cerebellar peduncle. This pathway sends information regarding motor commands to the cerebellum.              Medulla Cross-Section      The gracile and cuneate nuclei are located in the dorsal region of the medulla. They relay somatosensory information from the spinal cord to the thalamus.    Autonomic control nuclei (visceral sensory and motor) are located near the midline in the medulla. Other autonomic and respiratory control nuclei are located in the pons and midbrain.    The inferior olivary nucleus is located in the ventral part of the medulla. It has connections with the cerebellum for proprioception (limb position in space).    The pyramids containing the corticospinal axons for motor control are located at the very ventral aspect of the medulla.

	{"title": "Neurophysiology of the Visual Cortex", "text": "Central Visual Pathways  Signals are conveyed via the retinal ganglion cells up the optic nerve, and into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus.  Before reaching the LGN, some of the fibres of the optic nerve cross over at the optic chiasm.  After a synapse in the LGN, visual signals are then sent to the primary visual cortex (located around the calcarine sulcus).  What nerves cross at the optic chiasm?            Information from the left visual field is sent to the right visual cortex and vice versa.      Note that this is NOT THE SAME as having everything from the right eye go to the left visual cortex (this DOESN’T happen).      What actually happens is that everything on the left side of what you see goes to the right cortex, and vice versa. This is confusing, because the image information from the left visual field enters both the left and right eyes.      Hence, the fibres that actually cross are as follows:                  Information from the left visual field going into the left eye.          Information from the right visual field going into the right eye.                    Note that, as shown below, the L &amp; R visual field is defined by the fixation point that your eyes are focused on.      Clinical Correlations  Given the above crossing pattern, we can make some predictions as to what clinical findings we’d see with different pathologies.Example 1  Below, the L optic nerve is cut, so we don’t see anything from the L eye.  On the bottom right, the figure shows the visual deficit experienced by the patient, NOT the portion of the retina that’s affected.  Because you can receive information from both the L &amp; R visual field from both eyes, you’d end up with the following:          No information from the L or R visual field coming into the L eye.      Information from both the L and R visual field coming into the R eye.        Hence, we have blindness in the L eye.Example 2  Here, the optic chiasm is split in two.  Now, what we lose is the information crossing the optic chiasm. As before:          Information from the left visual field going into the left eye.      Information from the right visual field going into the right eye.Note that temporal and nasal refer to the lateral and medial sides of the each visual field respectively.        This results in the visual defect shown below → bitemporal hemianopsia.          When you close the R eye, you lose the L visual field.      When you close the L eye, you lose the R visual field.        Recall that this was a common finding with large pituitary adenomas, which compress the optic chiasm.Example 3  Here, the R optic tract is cut.  Note that optic nerve = before the optic chiasm, while optic tract = after the optic chiasm.  Since the R optic tract receives the information from the L visual fields of both eyes, you end up losing the L visual field information from both eyes.  This results in a finding called left homonymous hemianopsia.          Homonymous = same on both sides.      Hemianopsia = half cannot see.        Remember      Optic nerve = before the optic chiasm.    Optic tract = after the optic chiasm.  Projections of the Optic Tract  90% of the optic tract axons go to the LGN of the thalamus (top right)  The other 10% go to the midbrain (bottom right), to 2 particular regions:          Superior colliculus (guides orientation).      Edinger-Westphal Nucleus (for the pupillary light reflex).        Note that the Edinger-Westphal nucleus mediates the pupillary light reflex, and not the LGN.          Hence, you don’t need a functioning thalamus to have a functional pupillary light reflex!        The LGN is composed of 6 layers:          Layers 1-2 receive information from magnocellular cells.      Layers 3-6 receive information from parvocellular cells.      This is a continuation of the functional division that we saw in the processing in the retina.      Furthermore, the information from each eye remains segregated at this point (each layer is monocular).      In other word, although layers 1 and 2 both receive information from magnocellular cells, they receive this information from a different eye.      Convergence only happens at the level of the visual cortex.        Recall from the previous lecture that:          Magnocellular (M) ganglion cells receive information mainly from rods in the peripheral retina.      Parvocellular (P) ganglion cells receive information mainly from cones in the fovea.      In addition, since the rods are the light sensitive ones, the M-cells also project to the midbrain to mediate the pupillary light reflex and orientation.      Projections from the LGN  Neurons from the LGN project to the primary visual cortex.          This is via a fibre bundle called the optic radiation.      As mentioned before, the primary visual cortex is located along the calcarine sulcus in the occipital lobe.        SYNONYMS for the Primary Visual Cortex:           Striate cortex, V1, area 17  Recall from Introduction to Neurophysiology that layer 4 of the cortex is responsible for reciving information, and that layers 3 &amp; 5 are responsible for sending it.      Area 17 is based on the Brodmann classification we saw previously.      The term ‘striate cortex’ derives from the ‘stripy’ appearance of the cortical layers, due to intense input from LGN into layer 4 of the cortex.        Summary of the Path of Visual Information      Light    Photoreceptors              Rods        Cones              Bipolar Cell    Retinal Ganglion Cell              Magnocellular (M) Cells correspond mainly to rods.        Parvocellular (P) Cells correspond mainly to cones.              Optic Nerve    Optic Chiasm              Information from the left visual field in both eyes go to the right side.        Information from the right visual field in both eyes go to the left side.              Optic Tract → the name for the optic ‘nerve’ past the chiasm.    Lateral Geniculate Nucleus → 6 layers.              Layers 1-2 receive information from the M cells.        Layers 3-6 receive information from the P cells.        Projections also go to the midbrain instead of the LGN, to the superior colliculus and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (pupillary light reflex).              Optic Radiation    Primary Visual Cortex  Processing in the Primary Visual CortexRetinotopy  The retina contains an orderly representation of the visual world, which is carried forward up the visual pathway (LGN, V1, and beyond).  Retinotopy describes how the retina is mapped to a given structure.          Note that this isn’t a one-to-one representation of the visual world; there is an over-representation of the fovea, where the majority of photoreceptors are located.      Almost 50% of V1 is devoted to processing images from the area at or near the fovea.        Retinotopy in V1:            Going from superficial to deep in V1, we go from central to peripheral. In other words, the superficial regions of V1 correspond to the areas near the fovea, and the deep regions correspond to the peripheral retina.      Furthermore, below the calcarine sulcus is the region corresponding to the upper visual field, and above the calcarine sulcus is the region corresponding to the lower visual field.      Types of V1 Neurons  V1 neurons respond to specific stimulus features, such as orientation, movement, and size.  These representations can be demonstrated through neurophysiological recordings pioneered by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel (Nobel prize, 1981)            They recorded the brain of animals while they displayed visual stimuli, such as moving bars of light.      The observed neurons that would only emit action potentials from bars that were oriented vertically, for example.      From these studies, they identified 3 types of cells.        Classes of V1 Neurons          Simple Cells → respond to preferred orientation.      Complex Cells → respond to preferred orientation AND direction.      Hyper-complex Cells → respond to preferred orientation AND direction AND size.        See the below video for an example (super cool):          Simple Cell → see clip from 1:50 to 3:00.      Complex-cell → see clip from 7:15 to 8:00      Hyper-complex cell → → 9:00 to 9:35, 10:30 to 11:00        Neurons in V1      Simple Cells → respond to ORIENTATION.    Complex Cells → respond to ORIENTATION + DIRECTION.    Hyper-complex Cells → respond to ORIENTATION + DIRECTION + SIZE.    These neurons are simple feature detectors, much like the centre-surround organization seen in the retinal ganglia.  As we move further and further away from the retina, we end up seeing more complicated feature detectors (eg. face recognition, place recognition, etc),  This also relates to the nature of the deficits seen following lesions in different parts of the central visual pathways.Formation of V1 Neurons  How do these V1 neurons obtain these characteristics?          This is through the convergence of simpler feature detectors, as shown below.        SIMPLE CELLS:          Simple cells are are built by the convergence of centre-surround cells.      As mentioned before, these cells recognize edges by having the centre of the receptive field respond differently from the surrounding area.      By integrating information from a series of centre-surround cells detecting an edge, you can detect the orientation of that edge.          COMPLEX CELLS:          Complex cells are built by the convergence of centre-surround cells.      Here, by knowing the orientation of an edge at multiple points, you can observe the translation of an edge, and its rotation.      This lets you detect the direction of that edge.        HYPER-COMPLEX CELLS:          Hyper-complex cells are built by the *convergence of complex cells.      As before, by integrating information from simpler feature detectors, they can detect size.      Hypercolumns in V1  As mentioned above, the retina is projected onto V1 with the central retina projecting superficially, and the peripheral retina projecting deeply.  This ‘map’ is split up into hypercolumns, which each correspond to information from one small part of the retina.  Adjacent hypercolumns assess adjacent regions on the retina.  As was said before, this isn’t a one-to-one mapping of the visual field; the fovea is grossly overrepresented.  Structure of the Hypercolumns          Information from the LGN enters each hypercolumn at layer 4 of the cortex (as mentioned before, this was the layer that receives information).      The separate information from the L &amp; R eye then converge, via the simple and complex cells located immediately above and below layer 4.      This convergence leads to stereopsis (our sense of depth).      The mechanism behind this convergence is described right below.      Ocular Dominance Columns  80% of all V1 neurons respond to input from both eyes (binocular).          However, most respond better to one eye.      This preferential response is called ocular dominance.        Within a hypercolumn, cells with the same ocular dominance are organized into columns. These alternate across hypercolumns.          In other words, one row of hypercolumns will be left-dominant, and the adjacent row will be right-dominant.      The interface between the left-dominant row and the right-dominant row lets us compare findings between the two; this is the basis for stereopsis.      Features Derived from Hypercolumns  STEREOPSIS           As mentioned before, this is depth perception.      Obtained by the convergence of monocular cells predisposed to different eyes.      Because the ocular dominance columns alternate as described above, you get convergence at the junction points.        COLOUR           At the centre of each hypercolumn is a blob (seriously).      These blobs contain colour-sensitive double-opponent cells that let us distinguish between different shades of a colour.      Contrast this with the colour-opponent cells we saw in the retina, that let us distinguish between completely different colours, but not different shades.        ORIENTATION OF LINE SEGMENTS           Radiating from each blob are segments of simple and complex cells arranged in a pinwheel pattern.      This means that a different segment of the column will ‘light up’ when you see a feature at a specific orientation.      Clinical Aspects of V1  What happens if vision is deprived in one eye?          The image on the right shows the V1 of a normal monkey, where a tracer has been injected into one eye, and has traveled into V1.                    The white section corresponds to the region that got tracer; the black section corresponds to the region that didn’t.          Note that there is ‘zebra-striping’ of the primary visual cortex; there is even spacing between the ocular dominance columns, suggesting that both are similarly used.                    The image on the right here shows the V1 of a monkey that has been deprived of vision in one eye for 22 months.                    Here, the tracer was injected into the non-deprived eye (white), while the deprived eye had nothing injected (black).          Note that the black stripes from the deprived eye are much thinner than the white stripes. The non-deprived eye has ‘taken over’ V1.                    This suggests a USE IT OR LOSE IT phenomena; the region of cortex devoted to the side that was unused was lost.      CLINICAL CORRELATION → Amblyopia (cortical blindness).      Amblyopia  In infants, input from the two eyes compete for space in V1. If one eye sees poorly, then the dominant eye will take over.          In extreme cases, the non-dominant eye will lose all cortical representation; this leads to amblyopia (cortical blindness, or lazy eye).      Here, the issue isn’t with the afferents or efferents to the eye, but with the cortical destination of the information.        Common Treatment → PATCHING the dominant eye.          By patching the dominant eye, you give the weak eye an opportunity to ‘catch-up’.        Amblyopia is a particularly big problem in the first years of life, where V1 is particularly plastic.          It is not an issue later in life, because V1 is not nearly as plastic.      A similar deprivation in an adult (eg. a cataract in one eye) will not product amblyopia.      Strabismus  The most common cause of amblyopia is STRABISMUS.          Strabismus that is left untreated leads to amblyopia.        Strabismus → the two eyes do not align on the same image.          Here, visual acuity is normal, but there is a misalignment of the eyes, resulting in double vision.        How can strabismus lead to amblyopia?          Binocular cells are important for stereopsis (the sense of visual depth).      With strabismus, although each eye retains its V1 representation intially, binocular cells are never activated simultaneously by the same stimulus.      This is because the misalignment prevents us from observing ‘like’ features between the two eyes.      As a result, all cells eventually become monocular, and the child will permanently lose stereopsis.      Over time, ths image from one eye may actually become suppressed to get rid of the double vision, and you end up with amblyopia.        This is another example of Hebbian Plasticity:          Cells that fire together, wire together.      Without simultanous activation due to misalignment, you have no strengthening of the signal, and no development of the binocular cells.        Summary of V1        The primary visual cortex (V1) separates an image into distinct feature channels.    Different groups of cells work collectively to extract a particular feature.              Cells in blobs extract colour.        Binocular cells extract depth cues.        Simple and complex cells detect edges and simple motion.            Visual Processing Beyond V1  Higher‐order visual areas are collectively termed extra‐striate visual cortex.          From V1, information is relayed to V2, and then V3 (makes sense).      After V1, information then splays out into a host of other areas; over 3 dozen different visual areas!      Each of these different visual areas processes one unique feature; these could include facial recognition, or object recognition.      We’ll be discussing a few of these areas.      Visual Streams  After going from V1 → V2 → V3, information goes into a multitude of different areas.  However, these areas can be divided into 2 streams:          Dorsal Stream → responsible for ‘WHERE + ACTION’ processing.      Ventral Stream → responsible for ‘WHAT’ processing.        The dorsal stream, as its name suggests, projects to the dorsal surface fo the brain (posterior parietal cortex).          It selects actions depending on your position in space, and is hence the ‘where/action’ stream.      Hence, it’s involved in assessing where you are, and how you should go about doing actions based on that information.      Information going into the dorsal stream mainly comes from larger M-ganglion cells; this makes sense, since these are faster, and involved the light-sensitive rods.        The ventral stream projects to the inferior temporal lobe:          It is involved in the perception and recognition of objects (eg. faces, places, tools), and is hence the ‘what/perception’ stream.      Information going into the ventral stream mainly comes from smaller P-ganglion cells; this also makes sense, since these involve the colour sensitive cones, and the visually acute fovea.        Visual Streams for Processing      After visual information goes from V1 → V2 → V3, it splits into either a dorsal or ventral stream:                               Dorsal Stream        Ventral Stream                            Location        Dorsal (Posterior Parietal Cortex)        Ventral (Inferior Temporal Lobe)                    Function        Where/action        What (recognition)                    Source of information        M-ganglion cells        P-ganglion cells            Examples of Ventral Stream (WHAT) Regions  Lateral Occipital Cortex           Early part of the ventral stream (= WHAT).      It encodes objects (but not faces, or places; these are a separate location).      Lesions of the LOC produce visual agnosia; the inability to perceive objects through vision.      Patients can see the object’s form, and even copy it, but can’t identify the object or its use through vision.      Interestingly, the deficit is limited to vision only; patients can still identify objects by other senses (eg. they can distinguish between a knife and fork by touch).        Fusiform Face Area           Further on in the ventral stream; as its name suggests, it’s involved in face encoding.      Lesions of the FFA result in prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize faces (even their own).      Amazingly, patients can still recognize features of a face (lips, eyebrows, nose), since that’s governed by the LOC mentioned just above.      Just like before, this deficit is vision specific; patients can still recognize people by features like their voice, smell, or even their gait.      Examples of Dorsal Stream (ACTION) Regions  Area MT (Middle Temporal)           This is a key component of the dorsal stream, and it plays a role in analyzing visual motion.      A lesion of MT impairs the automatic perception of motion.      As a result, visual motion becomes a series of snap-shots.      This is pretty debilitating; won’t be able to drive, cross street, etc.        Posterior Parietal Cortex           Involved in producing actions.      Lesions of the dorsal stream at the parietal lobe produce action-based deficits.      For instance, patients with parietal lobe lesions can exhibit optic ataxia: they can recognize an object, but cannot reach to it accurately in the periphery, even though motor function is unimpaired.      So if you had an injury to your L parietal lobe (dorsal stream), you wouldn’t be able to grab something in your R visual field.      In other words, they cannot coordinate their actions with what they see on the retina. They can do the movement just fine, but they have issues guiding their hand to the right location.      Integration of the Two Streams  We have shown that:          The dorsal stream is excellent at determining the direction of motion, but is very poor at determining fine features.      The ventral stream is excellent at extracting features, but is very poor at determining aspects of motion.        Hence, information from both streams is necessary for determining what an object is, and where it’s going.  Much with much of what we’ve seen earlier, this is yet another example of division of labour and the integration of multiple discrete features.Summary  Predictable visual deficits follow lesions of the central visual pathways.  Retinotopy, found in V1 and beyond, devotes a disproportionately large area of tissue to information from the fovea.  Detection of progressively more complex visual features continues in V1 and beyond.  Stereopsis (depth perception) arises in V1 with balanced input from each eye.          Failure of this during development, perhaps due to strabismus, may result in amblyopia.        Higher‐order visual processing accomplished by two separate visual streams:.          Dorsal “action” or “where” pathway concerned with spatial aspects of an object.      Ventral “perception” or “what” pathway concerned with object recognition and perception.

	{"title": "Neurophysiology of the Eye", "text": "Lecture Overview  The next 2 lectures will focus exclusively on the neurophysiology of the visual system.          The first lecture will focus on phototransduction (the conversion of photon reception into action potentials).      The next lecture will focus on the CNS pathways that interpret visual information.      Fundamental Components of the Visual System  Eye  Retina  Optic nerves, optic chiasm, optic tract  Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)  Primary Visual Cortex (V1, or Striate Cortex)  Extrastriate Visual CortexThe EyeAnatomy of the EyeAnterior View  Pupil → the black spot in your eye through which light goes through.  Iris → what regulates the size of your pupil (via dilation or constriction).  Cornea → the transparent covering the pupil and iris.  Extraocular muscles → moves the eye around, so the most sensitive areas are pointed towards areas of interest.  Retina → a light sensitive layer of tissue covering the inside of the eye. This is where photoreception occurs.  Optic nerve → where all the sensory neurons from the retina converse and exit the eye, and head towards the brain.Cross-Section  Lens → can change shape to refract light such that an image converges directly onto the retina.  Aqueous Humour → the fluid located between the cornea and lens.  Vitreous Humour → the more gelatinous substance between the lens and retina.  Fovea → the region on your retina with the sharpest vision (the most photoreceptors are located here).Focusing Light on the Retina  As mentioned above, the lens is used to refract light such that an image converges on the retina.  When you’re looking far away, light rays are coming at a shallower angle, so the lens does not need to be too convex to focus light onto the retina.  On the other hand, when you’re looking closely at something, the lens must be more convex (‘fatter’) in order to obtain focus.  The shape of the lens is controlled by ciliary muscles, which are connected to the lens by zonule fibres.  This is why your eyes get tired when you look at close objects for a long period of time!           When the muscles are relaxed, the lens is flat. This is unaccomodated, and is used for distance points.      When the muscles are contracted, the lens becomes fat. This is accommodated, and is used for near points.        Think of the ciliary muscles like ‘purse strings’. when you pull on them, the purse gets scrunched up; and when you loosen them, the purse becomes flatter.  Remember      Unaccomodation → when the ciliary muscles are relaxed, and the lens is thus flat. This is used to look at points that are far away.    Accomodation → when the ciliary muscles are contracted, and the lens is thus fat. This is used to look at points that are close by.  Corrective Lenses  Corrective Lenses → used when you have difficulty focusing light on the retina.          Myopia → aka. near-sightedness (can focus on near images, but not distant).      Hyperopia → aka. far-sightedness (can focus on distant images, but not near).        With myopia, the lens is too ‘fat’ when looking at distant objects, so light converges anterior to the retina. In this case, a concave lens can be used to diverge the light such that it hits the retina precisely.  Similarly, with hyperopia, the lens is too ‘flat’ when looking at close objects, so light converges posterior to the retina. In this case, a convex lens can be used to refocus the light.  As you age, your lens becomes less elastic, and remains too flat for near images, even when the ciliary muscles are completely contracted.  When this happens, images of near objects are blurred, and reading glasses are required.  What happens when myopic people get older, and also can’t see close objects?            If you’re near-sighted when you’re younger, and then begin losing your close-up vision, what can you do?      If you stuck with corrective lenses as above, you’d have to constantly change from a concave to convex lens when changing from far to close vision!      This is when bifocal glasses are useful (invented by Ben Franklin).      With bifocal glasses, the top half is more concave for looking at distant objects, and the bottom half is more convex for looking at close objects.      The Iris and the Pupillary Light Reflex  The iris contricts in bright light, so that the pupil becomes smaller and fewer rays of light enter.  This is termed the pupillary light reflex, and it functions to prevent the light-sensitive photoreceptors from being saturated by too much light.  Reducing the pupil diamater can also help sharpen an image, much like how narrowing the aperture on a camera increases the depth of field.  In order for the reflex to function, you need a normal afferent signal (via the optic nerve), and a normal efferent signal (via the oculomotor nerve).          Hence, the direct and consensual reflexes are a good test to assess CN II &amp; III.      The RetinaCell Types of the Retina  There are 5 cell types in the retina:            Photoreceptors → 2 types:                  Rods → light-sensitive.          Cones → colour-senstive (3 types, 1 per primary colour).          Mnemonic: C goes with C (cones, colour).                    Ganglion Cells → there are the only cells that actually produce action potentials.                  Hence, the ganglion cells function as the output neurons, whose axons comprise the optic nerve.                    Bipolar Cells → connect the photo-receptors and the ganglion cells.                  Hence, these connect the cells that receive the signal to the cells that output it.          Recall that we saw these in Introduction to Neuroanatomy, in contrast to multipolar and unipolar neurons.                    Horizontal Cells      Amacrine Cells        The horizontal and amacrine cells are responsible for some degree of image processing; this actually begins in the retina, and not the brain.          This is termed lateral information flow.        Remember      There are 5 cell types in the retina:              Photoreceptors → rods + cones.        Bipolar Cells → connect photoreceptors to ganglion cells.        Ganglion Cells → output the signal via the optic nerve.        Horizontal Cells        Amacrine Cells.              A signal travels from the photoreceptors → bipolar cell → ganglion cell, up the optic disc.    Horizontal cells and amacrine cells regulate the activity of multiple photoreceptor cells, and allow for some degree of image processing.  Phototransduction  Phototransduction is the process that converts light energy (photons) into neural signals.  Rods and cones have photo‐sensitive molecules in the outer segment that are sensitive to particular wavelengths of light.  Arrival of an appropriate photon triggers an amplifying cascade which produces a receptor potential in the photoreceptor. This amplification makes the receptors so sensitive that we can see a flash from a single photon.  Absorption of a photon triggers a molecular cascade that closes Na+ channels.          Less Na+ in results in hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor, releasing less neurotransmitter at the other end of the photoreceptor (the inner segment).        Darkness does the opposite; it opens the Na+ channels.          More Na+ flooding in results in depolarization of the receptor, releasing more neurotransmitter on the other end.        THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU’D EXPECT.          In most systems, you’d effect a stimulus to lead to depolarization; here it actually leads to hyperpolarization.      Cones vs Rods  Cones are primarily found at the fovea, the part of the retina that we use to see with high detail.          Cones are responsible for colour vision, but are less sensitive to light (they have a smaller outer segment, where photo-sensitive pigment is located).      At the fovea, there are exclusively cones; there aren’t any rods. Hence, we see colours best at the fovea.        Rods are primarily found at the peripheral retina.          Rods are responsible for light sensitivity; they have a larger outer segment, and hence are more sensitive to light.      Hence, we can see light okay throughout the retina, except for the fovea.        Because the fovea has no rods, you can actually see dimmer things better when you don’t directly focus on them, and instead keep them in your periphery. You can try this when you’re looking at dim stars while star-gazing.  Cones vs Rods                             Cones        Rods                            Function        Colour Sensitivity        Light Sensitivity                    Primary Location        Fovea        Peripheral Retina                    Size        Smaller (small outer segment)        Larger (large outer segment)            Finding your Blind Spot  At the optic nerve, there are no photo-receptors; hence this is a blind spot.          Recall that light has to travel through the other cells in order to hit the photo-receptors.      Because of that, where the axons of the ganglion cells converge to form the optic nerve, no light can pass through.      Normally this isn’t an issue, because we have 2 eyes, and the blind spots don’t overlap.      When we close our eyes, the blind spot does appear, but our brain masks it by ‘filling in the gap’.        We can see this with the demonstration on the right:            Close your right eye, and focus on the ‘X’ at the right.      Move your screen closer to you until the circle disappears.      At this point, the light from the circle is hitting the optic nerve, where there aren’t any photoreceptors; this causes it to disappear (whoaaa).        We can also assess how the brain ‘fills in’ the gap:            Do the same thing now, except this time, note that the space where the dot was is now black.      In other words, the brain filled in the blind spot with the background colour!      Visual Acuity at the Fovea  As mentioned before, the fovea only contains cones, and is thus highly sensitive to colour.  THIS IS ALSO THE AREA OF THE EYE WITH THE HIGHEST VISUAL ACUITY.  There are a few reasons for this.          Fewer cells to travel through                   At the fovea, the cells that normally lie on top of the photoreceptors (bipolar cells, ganglia cells), are pushed to the side.          This is why the fovea is a pit; the cells on top are pushed to the margins of the fovea.          Since there are fewer things blocking the photoreceptors, light scatters less, and our visual acuity improves.                    Ganglion cells at the fovea have a smaller receptive field                  A ganglion cell at the peripheral retina receives converging information from many widely-spaced photoreceptors. This produces a large receptive field (~3° of visual angle).          In contrast, a ganglion cell at the fovea receives convering information from a few closely-packed photoreceptors. This produces a small receptive field (~0.3° of visual angle).          As a result, when 2 photons about a degree apart hit photoreceptors at the periphery, they’ll feed to a single ganglion cell, which will only register 1 point of light.          On the other hand, when the same happens at the fovea, since the receptive field is narrower, you’ll see 2 points of light.          This is a similar idea to how the body has different 2-point discrimination at the hands versus the legs (the hands are more sensitive to touch).                     Retinal Ganglion CellsDon’t confuse these with the magnocellular and parvocellular neurons we saw in Endocrinology, which come from the hypothalamus innervate the pituitary. Magno- just means big, and parvo- just means small; there’s no association.  As mentioned before, the retinal ganglion cells are the cells that ultimately output a signal to the brain.  These retinal ganglion cells fall into 2 main classes.            P-cells (Parvocellular Cells)                  Sensitive to colour, so mainly receive from cones.          Smaller receptive fields (as mentioned above).          Smaller, slower conducting.          Comprise 90% of ganglion cells (most of our ganglion cells are concentrated at the fovea).                    M-cells (Magnocellular Cells)                  Not sensitive to coour, mainly receive from rods.          Larger receptive fields.          Larger, faster conducting.          5-10% of all ganglion cells.          Best activated by transient, moving stimuli (this makes sense, since they largely receive from our peripheral vision).                      Because the two ganglion cells largely receive different types of inputs, we are already extracting different features from the world at the level of the retina.          As we move up the visual pathway, we’ll see how more and more complex feature extraction works.      These cell types also project to different layers of the LGN (recall, lateral geniculate nucleus, part of thalamus that receives vision), which reflects a compartmentalization that we see throughout the visual system.        P-cells vs M-cells                             Parvocellular (P) Cells        Magnocellular (M) Cells                            Receives from        Cones (colour)        Rods (light)                    Size        Small (hence parvo-)        Large (hence magno-)                    Receptive Field        Small        Large                    Conduction speed        Slower        Faster                    Additional features        Comprise 90% of ganglion cells        Best activated by transient, moving stimuli            Why is it difficult to read in low Illumination?  You usually use your fovea to read; the region of the eye with the most visual acuity.  However, the fovea is also less sensitive to light, so in dim lighting, you have to rely more on your peripheral retina.  Hence, you have to rely on your less acute regions of vision to read (another way of illustrating this: try reading an entire line of text without moving your eyes; you should see how the acuity falls off with increasing distance from the fovea).Assessing Vision  In summary, at the fovea, we have the most visual acuity and sensitivity to colour, but poorer sensitivity to light.  In contrast, in the periphery, we have the least visual acuity and colour sensitivity, but the most sensitivity to light.  When we assess vision, our tests reflect this:          Letter Chart (Snellen Chart)                  Done to assess visual acuity, so we test the fovea.          Hence, it’s done in bright light, and you’re allowed to move your eyes to focus light onto the fovea.                    Visual Field Test                  Done to assess the function of the rods in the periphery.          Here, you fixate on one point, so you have to rely on your peripheral vision.          The patient presses a button whenever they see a flash in the periphery (hence, only light sensitivity is assessed).          Areas of the visual field that do not elicit a button press are called scotomas (blind spots), and indicate a visual deficit.                    Colour Vision  We have 3 cones; their names correspond to the wavelength at which they have peak sensitivity (red, green, blue).  However, the absorption spectrum for each is actually quite wide, and they can overlap. This overlap helps differentiate more subtle hues.  Since we have 3 types of cones, we have trichromatic vision.Colour Blindness  2% of males lack the red or green pigment          They are referred to as red-green colour blind, and are dichromats, since they only have 2 types of cones.      They would not be able to see the number on the right, because the only difference between the red and green in the image is hue (they have the same intensity).        6% of males have all 3 pigments, but the green pigment is shifted towards the red one.          These are referred to as anomalous trichromats; they are trichromats, but they aren’t as sensitive to differences between red and green as the general population.        Hence, in total, about 8% of the male population has some form of colour blindness, as opposed to only about 0.5% of females.          This is because it often has an X-linked inheritance pattern.        Dichromats (2%) are missing one cone type,  Monochromats (rare) are missing two cone types,  Achromats (very rare) are missing all cone types.Visual Processing in the RetinaProcessing Changes in Intensity  We saw that multiple photoreceptors converse to a single ganglion cell.  However, this wasn’t the complete story; photoreceptors that connect to the same ganglion cell are NOT treated in the same way.  In fact, their response to light input can be inhibitory or excitatory depending on the location of the photo-receptor on their receptive field.  More formally, they have a centre-surround organization, which is mediated by the actions of the bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells (which we mentioned before).          What this means is that the centre of the receptive field is treated differently as the surrounding area.      Centre-surround organization can either be on-centre or off-centre.        On-centre → where the centre of the receptive field is stimulated by light (hence it’s turned ‘on’), and the surrounding area is inhibited.  Off-centre → the opposite, where the centre of the receptive field is inhibited by light (hence it’s turned ‘off’), and the surrounding area is stimulated.  Why is a centre-surround organization useful?    (Random aside) This idea is similar to how you convolve a signal with a Laplacian of a Gaussian filter in image processing!          It allows you to ACCENTUATE EDGES!      When you cross an edge where one side is dark, and the other side is bright, you can stimulate both the centre and the surrounding area of the receptive field in the same way.      This gives you a more accentuated stimulatory or inhibitory effect.      Artists actually exploit this by darkening one side of an edge, and lightening the other.      This is also why we see illusory ‘bands’ around edges, where the darker side of the edge looks darker than the surrounding area, and vice versa.        Center‐surround also aids in constancy, by measuring the change across an edge, rather than absolute light levels.  This helps letters on a page stand out whether you are indoors in dim light or outdoors in bright sun.  This occurs despite the background indoors being darker than the letter outdoors!Processing Changes in Hue  With cones, we have a similar organization with colour-opponent cells.  In these cells, the presence of a specific wavelength in the surrounding area inhibits the response to another wavelength in the centre.  Hence, this helps detect edges between colours (different wavelengths).  However, it does a poor job of detecting edges between similar colours (similar wavelengths); this is something that the primary visual cortex plays a role in.3 Diseases of the Eye  Cataracts → clouding of the lens.          Here, vision everywhere is affected equally, because the clouding results in blurring of the light in a uniform manner.        Glaucoma → disorders that result in optic nerve damage.          Most typically caused by increased intraocular pressure.      The periphery is affected more because you have fewer axons there; this results in tunnel vision.        Macular Degeneration → deposits underneath the retina affect vision.          These deposits (fatty/blood vessels), predominantly affect the fovea first.      As a result, we lose central vision first.      These deposits also distort the retinal sheath, resulting in image distortion.        Summary of the Eye      The eye does three things:              It focuses the image on the retina. Image focus depends on lens shape, pupil diameter, shape (length) of eye, lens clarity, and if the image lands on the fovea.        It detects light of various colours and intensities        It compresses the information in order to send it down the optic nerve. Compressions occurs by:                      A detailed image is sent only from a small part of the eye, which is the fovea.            Through retinal processing of an image, we’re particularly sensitive to edges.                                What the eye sends the brain is a poor reflection of the original image, yet we perceive our visual world with clarity. This is done by the visual cortex, the topic of the next lecture  ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/18/neurophysiology-eye.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Neurophysiology", "text": "Introduction to the Brain  Much of this lecture is review, but it aims to bring everyone onto the same page for subsequent lectures.  An adult human brain contains 100 billion neurons, and 10x as many glia cells.          Gray Matter → neurons.      White Matter → axons.        Just like the 6-degrees of separation concept, there are at most 4 degrees of separation between any pair of neurons in the brain.  If you took all the white matter in the brain, and strung it end to end, you’d have something that’s several million miles in total length.          Hence, sending action potentials across this massive network is energetically expensive; only a small percentage of neurons are active at any one time.      The brain, which is only 1-3% of your total body mass, actually uses 20% of the body’s energy.      You would faint due to a lack of oxygen if more than 5% of your neurons were active at the same time!      Because of how hungry the brain is for energy, and decreases in oxygenation will often present with neurological findings first!        When a certain part of your gray matter is in use, blood is directed preferentially to that region.            This is the basis for fMRI (functional MRI) → deoxyhemoglobin is used as a contrast agent in order to visualize areas with high blood flow.      This lets you indirectly assess regions of high neurological activity.        Another method of imaging is Diffusion Tensor Imaging, which reveals the ‘connectome’ between the neurons in the brain.            This is useful in assessing conditions such as epilepsy, where a locus of abnormal activity can spread through these connections to other areas, resulting in a seizure.      Both fMRI and DTI have exploded in popularity for both basic and clinical research, and will continue to do so in the coming years.        Remember      fMRI (functional MRI) → assesses cortical activity indirectly, via blood flow.    DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) → assesses axonal connectivity.    NEUROMYTH → You only use 10% of your brain.          Myth → 90% of your brain power is just waiting to be untapped.      Origin is somewhat unclear:                  May have started from a misinterpretation of the works of William James by Dale Carnegie, who wrote the preface to Carnegie’s self-help book How to Win Friends and Influence People.          Could also have been a misinterpretation of the works of Karl Lashley and Wilder Penfield at the MNI (large areas of “silent” cortex are non-responsive to electrical stimulation).          May also be related to the 10:1 glia-to-neuron ratio (glial cells are any non-neuronal cells that supports/helps the neuron)                    Reality:                  FALSE; you use 100% of your brain!          The brain uses all available neural tissue, as has been verified by fMRI studies.          While not all of the brain is functioning at the same time, all of it is used.          Furthermore, minor brain damage can have devastating effects, which wouldn’t make sense if only 10% of your brain was being used.          “Silent” cortex is not so silent after all; newer studies show that these areas are functional.          Why would we evolve something we don’t use?                    Review of The Neuron  Neuron → the physiological functional unit of the nervous system.  Neurons and muscle cells are excitable; they can generate and respond to electrical signals.  Components of the Neuron:          Soma → cell body.      Axon → sends information via action potentials.      Dendrite → receives and integrates information.      Synapse → point of contact between neurons.        Neurons have a resting membrane potential of about -65 mV.          Depolarization → less negative than resting potential.      Hyperpolarization → more negative than resting potential.        Action potentials start at the axon hillock (the junction between the axon and the cell body), and continue all the way down to the axon terminal.          Once a threshold is reached, the action potential goes to completion; hence this is an all-or-none signal.      Propagation is accelerated by myelination, which permits skipping of the action potential from one Node of Ranvier to another (saltatory conduction).      Multiple Sclerosis → an example of a demyelinating disease of the CNS.                  Another example is Guillain-Barré syndrome, which affects the PNS.                      Remember      Multiple Sclerosis → demyelinating disease of the CNS.    Guillain-Barré Syndrome → demyelinating disease of the PNS.  Coding Sensory Information  This all-or-none concept is important with respect to the brain.          This means that the inputs to the brain are effectively only a series of 0s or 1s.      From this, how do you get such fine-grained perceptions of the world?        Some examples are listed below:          Frequency Coding → where the frequency of action potential firing is used to interpret stimulus. For instance, a soft stimulus will have slow axon potential firing, while a hard stimulus will have fast firing.      Population Coding → where the population of neurons that are firing is used to interpret stimulus.      Duration Coding → where the duration of the action potential firing is used to interpret stimulus.      Labeled Line Coding → information about sensory modality is conveyed along dedicated sensory pathways. (e.g., information sent through the optic nerve is interpreted as vision-related).      Circuit Principles  Convergence           Axonal branches of many neurons reach one target neuron for comparison or integration.      Relevant in sensory neuroscience for feature extraction.        Divergence           Axonal branches of one neuron reach many target neurons.      Relevant in motor control to ensure coordinate actions, and the contextual control of reflexes.        Remember      Convergence is important in the sensory system for feature extraction.    Divergence is important in the motor system for coordinating actions.  Chemical Synapses  SIGNAL INITIATION → Arrival of the action potential at the axon terminal triggers Ca2+ mediated release of a neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft:          Examples of neurotransmitters: Acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, etc.        SIGNAL RECEPTION → The neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, producing a response.          These receptors can be grouped into 2 broad classes → ionotropic and metabotropic.                  Ionotropic → binding opens ion channels (fast action, local effects).          Metabotropic → actions are mediated through a second-messenger system (more widespread, longer-lasting effects). The canonical example are the GPCRs.                      SIGNAL TERMINATION → once the signal has been triggered, it also has to be stopped.          The method of termination differs depending on the neurotransmitter. Examples include (1) diffusion, (2) enzymatic destruction, or (3) re-uptake.      For instance, with acetylcholine, the ACh signal was broken down via acetylcholinesterase.        Receptor Subtypes      Ionotropic → binding opens ion channels, for fast &amp; local effects.    Metabotropic → binding triggers a downstream cascade, for widespread &amp; longer-lasting effects.  Ionotropic Responses  As mentioned above, these are fast, local effects.  EPSPs → Excitatory Post Synaptic Potentials.          Where the post-synaptic membrane is depolarized.      The major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain is glutamate.      The excitatory neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction is acetylcholine.      The NMDA receptors for glutamate are modifiable; this allows for synaptic plasticity (strengthening or weakening of the post-synaptic response). This is the foundation of learning and memory.          IPSPs → Inhibitory Post Synaptic Potentials.          Where the post-synaptic membrane is hyperpolarized.      The major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is GABA (GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid).      The inhibitory neurotransmitter at the spinal cord is glycine.      Many sedating or tranquilizing drugs target GABA receptors, such as the benzodiazepines (eg. Lorazepam).          Summary of Ionotropic Responses                             EPSP (Excitatory)        IPSP (Inhibitory)                            Definition        Where the post-synaptic membrane is depolarized.        Where the post-synaptic membrane is hyperpolarized                    Corresponding Neurotransmitter(s)        Brain → glutamateNMJ → acetylcholine        Brain → GABASpinal Cord → glycine              Synaptic Integration → multiple EPSPs and IPSPs can be summed up over space (spatial summation) and time (temporal summation) by the downstream neuron.          The net effect of the EPSPs and IPSPs may or may not be enough to trigger a downstream action potential; this is how multiple signals are integrated.       Metabotropic Responses  As mentioned above, these are longer-lasting, widespread effects.  With metabotropic receptors, actions are mediated through a second messenger system.  For example, G-protein coupled receptors can alter cellular metabolism, regulate ion channel function, or trigger widespread metabolic effects. This is another pathway for synaptic plasticity.  Examples include receptors for dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.  The systems that govern our emotions are largely controlled by metabotropic responses.Neuropharmacology  There are many neurotransmitters (&gt; 50 at last count), but they generally fall into 3 categories:          Amino Acids → eg. GABA, glutamate, glycine.      Amines → Acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.      Peptides → Substance P (associated with pain &amp; inflammation), dynorphin (opioid).        Drugs that affect the brain affect the receptors for these transmitters, or how they get eliminated.Examples of Neuroreceptors  We’ll be looking at two neat neuroreceptors:          GABAA receptor.      NMDA receptor.      1. GABAA Receptor  GABAA Receptor → inhibitory ionotropic receptor in the brain.          Recall that we saw previously that GABA was the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.        One GABA receptor is the GABAA receptor.  On this receptor, there are multiple binding sites, for different agonists.          Some of these include ethanol, barbituates, and benzodiazepines.      That’s why all of these make you sleepy. They all stimulate an inhibitory receptor!      Since they also bind to different regions on the receptor, they can have multiplicative effects; this is why it’s dangerous to be on benzodiazepines and drink, for instance.        Many drugs also act on other receptors:          For instance, alcohol also antagonizes the glutamate receptors; recall that glutamate has an excitatory effect in the brain.      Hence, the depressive/sedating effect of alcohol is through two mechanisms → upregulation of inhibitory GABAA receptor activity, and downregulation of excitatory glutamate receptor activity.      2. NMDA Receptor  NMDA Receptor → excitatory ionotropic receptor in the brain. receptor for glutamate.          Recall that we saw previously that glutamate was the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.        The NMDA receptor has a neat feature → the receptor only opens if the cell is already depolarized.          This allows it to be used as a COINCIDENCE DETECTOR; it detects whether multiple excitatory signals are firing at the same time.      This coincidence detector then adjusts synaptic strength, so that synapses that fire together are strengthened.                  Hebbian Learning → cells that fire together, wire together          In other words, the NMDA receptor allows for the detection of signals that are firing in synchrony, allowing for strengthening of synapses that fire together, and the pruning of those that don’t.          Hence, this plays an important role in learning and plasticity.                    Hebbian learning is important in the development of stereopsis (depth perception).        NEUROMYTH → The brain is only plastic during critical periods.          Myth → for example, the first 3 years of a child’s life are decisive for later brain development and success.      Origin:                  Pioneering studies in animal behaviour on imprinting (e.g., in birds right after hatching)          Visual experience early in life determines how much of the visual cortex is devoted to processing input from each eye.                    Reality                   ONLY PARTIALLY TRUE. Although it’s true that the first 3 years of life are important for the development of some neurological systems (eg. sensory modalities), it is not generalizable to all learning.          The human brain retains plasticity throughout life. eg, recovery can follow brain damage, and new capacities can be learned throughout life (eg, London UK cab drivers have enlarged hippocampi, which plays a role in spatial memory).          Even in the sensory domains, the concept of a “critical period” is not so sharply defined (a better term may be “sensitive period”).                    Brodmann’s Areas  Gray matter consists of 6 anatomically distinct layers.            Information is received in layer 4.      Information is output in layers 3 &amp; 5.Recall that the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus relays sensory information to the primary visual cortex.        Hence, regions of the cortex that receive lots of information will have a thick layer 4; one example is the primary visual cortex.          In fact, the primary visual cortex is also called the striate cortex because of it’s thick layer 4.        Similarly, regions of the cortex that send lots of information will have thick layers 3 &amp; 5; one example is the primary motor cortex.  These cytological and histological differences are the basis for Brodmann’s Areas          More than 100 years ago, K Brodmann used differences in these cortical features to subdivide the brain into 52 different regions.      Examples include area 17 (the striate cortex), and area 4 (the primary motor cortex).      Continuing research shows that each area may even have functional subdivisions (eg. 3a, 3b, etc).        KEY POINT → different areas of the brain do different things, and these patterns of distribution are largely reproducible between people.            The classic example was the case of Phineas Gage, who was an American railway worker who had a tamping iron driven through his frontal lobe after an explosion.      Upon recovery, personality changes were observed, which suggested that different regions of the cortex had different functions.      Although he was considered the “index case” for personality changes due to frontal lobe damage, it’s now recognized that many of the behavioural claims were exaggerated to fit pet theories.

Describe the location and major functions of the hypothalamus and epithalamus.Review of the Cerebrum  Components of the Cerebrum:          Cerebral Cortex (Gray Matter)                  Superficial cortical layer of gray matter containing neuronal cell bodies                    Cerebral White Matter                  Deeper layer of white matter containing fibers connecting cell bodies to other cortical areas and the rest of the brain                    Deep Gray Matter                  Comprises the basal ganglia; the deepest layer of large collections of neuronal cell bodies.                    Basal Ganglia  Basal Ganglia → deep layer of neuronal cell bodies located in the cerebrum (deep gray matter).          Shown in pink on the right.      Note that this is c-shaped; as we discussed in Anatomy of the Cerebrum, the cerebrum develops embryologically as a c-shape.      Since the basal ganglia is part of the cerebrum, it follows this shape as well.      In coronal sections, since the caudate nucleus sort of loops around a bit, you can often see it represented twice.        Objective      Identify the main structures that comprise the basal ganglia.    Anatomically, it consists of the following:            Caudate nucleus.      Putamen.      Globus pallidus.      Amygdala.        Lentiform nucleus → refers to the putamen + globus pallidus.  Thalamus → just medial to the lentiform nucleus.  Caudate nucleus → has 3 parts: (1) Head, (2) Body, (3) Tail.  Amygdala → Although many anatomical texts refer to the amygdala as a separate structure, anatomically it should be considered part of the basal ganglia.          As can be seen on the right, this is a round structure on the tail of the caudate nucleus. (recall that cauda = tail).      The amygdala is part of the limbic system, which governs our emotions.        Functions of the Basal Ganglia:          Motor → coordinate speed and strength of movements.      Cognition, learning, emotions.        Today, we’ll be focusing primarily on the motor function of the basal ganglia.          This is what’s most applicable clinically; dysfunctions in the basal ganglia lead to movement disorders.      Anatomic Location of the Basal Ganglia  Below are coronal and transverse (horizontal) cross-sections of the brain.  Note that the insular cortex can easily be seen here as the gray matter that is covered by the parietal and temporal lobes.  Below is an coronal section at an anterior location on the basal ganglia.  Note that we don’t see the thalamus here:          This is because the thalamus is posteromedial relative to the lentiform nucleus, so it’s posterior to the level at which the cross section was taken (see right).        Note the anatomy of the lentiform nucleus:          The Putamen is more lateral.      The Globus pallidus is more medial.        Below is a transverse (horizontal) section through the basal ganglia.          Here, you can actually see the head of the caudate nucleus, and where it attaches to the lentiform nucleus.      You don’t see the body of the caudate because it’s superior to the level of the cross section.      But you do see the tail as the ‘C’ curves back into the plane.      You can also see the thalamus more medially (the unlabelled midline gray matter).        Note that the globus pallidus has 2 parts, which are involved in different motor control pathways.:          External      Internal        Anatomic Components of the Basal Ganglia      Basal Ganglia → putamen + globus pallidus + caudate nucleus + amygdala.    Lentiform Nucleus → globus pallidus + putamen.    Striatum → putamen + caudate nucleus.    Lentiform nucleus is comprised of 2 more functionally dissimilar parts (putamen and globus pallidus).    Striatum is comprised of 2 more functionally similar parts (putamen + caudate nucleus).    The Role of the Basal Ganglia in Motor Control  In Anatomy of the Cerebrum, we saw the different CNS centres that participate in motor control, including:  The ideomotor area was located in the Posterior Multimodal Assocation Area, where all of our sensory information is integrated.          Ideomotor area → where you get the idea to move.      Premotor Cortex → planning of complex motions.      Primary Motor Cortex → located on the precentral gyrus.        There are 3 more systems that are very important for motor control, including:          Basal ganglia.      Cerebellum.      Spinal reflexes.        Today we’ll be focusing on the basal ganglia, which will provide a good foundation on the anatomy and structure for a subsequent TBL.Direct &amp; Indirect Striopallidal Pathways  Objective      Compare the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways of the basal ganglia.    As we saw previously, the primary motor cortex sends commands down to the spinal cord, and eventually to the muscles.          However, these commands are modulated by other structures, including the basal ganglia.      For the basal ganglia, this regulation ensures that the motor cortex is set at an appropriate level of activity (ie. initiating movements at the right strength &amp; speed).        There are 2 pathways through the basal ganglia, which regulate the primary motor cortex:          Direct Striopallidal Pathway.      Indirect Striopallidal Pathway.        As their names suggest, they go through the striatum (caudate nucleus + putamen), and the globus pallidus.  Direct Striopallidal Pathway          This is a direct pathway of feedback, via the internal globus pallidus.      Pathway: INPUT from motor cortex → striatum → internal globus pallidus → thalamus → motor cortex regulation.      RED = inhibitory connections.      GREEN = excitatory connections.      Hence, the net result is excitatory feedback to the motor cortex:                  You can think of this as multiplying (+1)’s and (-1)’s for excitatory and inhibitory signals respectively.          Since there are 2 (+1) connections, and 2 (-1) connections, the net result is an excitatory feedback.                    An easy way to remember the connections is to note that any connection leaving a structure in the basal ganglia is inhibitory:                  Hence any connection leaving the striatum, and internal/external globus pallidus, will be inhibitory.          Everything else is excitatory.                      Indirect Striopallidal Pathway          This is an indirect pathway of feedback, via the external globus pallidus.                  Here, there is an extra structure involved, called the subthalamic nucleus (part of the diencephalon).          Instead of going directly into the internal globus pallidus, the pathway first goes through the external globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus.                    Pathway: INPUT from motor cortex → striatum → external globus pallidus → subthalamic nucleus → internal globus pallidus → thalamus → motor cortex regulation.      Hence, the net result is inhibitory feedback to the motor cortex.        Through these two pathways, tone and activity for the motor cortex can be maintained.          Also shown in the above figure is the substantia nigra; which has a dopamine influence on the striatum, and also affects the direct and indirect striopallidal pathways.      This is important because the substantia nigra is the area that’s affected in Parkinson’s Disease.        Striopallidal Pathways      The DIRECT striopallidal pathway gives EXCITATORY feedback to the primary motor cortex.              It goes through the internal globus pallidus directly.              The INDIRECT striopallidal pathway gives INHIBITORY feedback to the primary motor cortex.              It goes through the external globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, before going into the internal globus pallidus.              To remember this, note that the two ‘I’s go together (indirect + inhibitory).  Disorders of the Basal Ganglia  Parkinson’s Disease → a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.          Results in understimulation of the motor cortex.      Symptoms include slow jerky movements, muscle rigidity, slow tremors, and bradykinesia (slow movement).        Huntington’s Disease → neuronal atrophy of the striatum (caudate nucleus + putamen).          In particular, this is a loss in the intrinsic inhibitory neurons, resulting in overstimulation of the motor cortex.      Symptoms are choreiform movements (brisk, jerky, purposeless movements of the limbs).        Schizophrenia → changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.          The nucleus accumbens is the basal part of the striatum, which connects to the lateral prefrontal cortex.      The nucelus accumbens is involved in motivational states and addictive behaviours.      Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, and disorded thoughts.      There is also often a deficit of normal emotional responses.        Disorders of the Basal Ganglia                    Disease        Cause        Symptoms                            Parkinson’s Disease        Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra        Slow jerky movements, muscle rigidity, slow tremors, bradykinesia                    Huntington’s Disease        Loss of the intrinsic inhibitory neurons in the striatum        Choreiform movements: brisk, jerky, purposeless movements of the limbs                    Schizophrenia        Changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which connects to the lateral prefrontal cortex        Delusions, hallucination, disordered thoughts, deficit of normal emotional responses            Diencephalon  The diencephalon is comprised of 4 structures:          Thalamus      Hypothalamus      Epithalamus = Pineal      Subthalamus (includes subthalamic nucleus)        So everything in the diencephalon is defined by their relation to the thalamus.          The difference between hypothalamus and the subthalamus is that the hypothalamus is below the thalamus, while the subthalamus is at the base of the thalamus.        We saw the subthalamus and thalamus previously as part of the striopallidal pathways:          Both the direct and indirect pathway went through the thalamus.      The indirect pathway also went through the subthalamic nucleus (in the subthalamus).        Anatomically, the thalamus lies below the fibres of the corpus callosum, and lies in the midline of the brain.          However, even though it’s midline, the thalamus is a paired structure; there is a L and R thalamus.      The L &amp; R thalamus are mostly separated by the third ventricle, and are joined only by an area called the interthalamic adhesion.        The pineal gland (aka. epithalamus) is not only superior to the thalamus, but also posterior.  Above the thalamus is another important structure called the fornix, which plays an important role in the limbic system.  Above is the horizontal cross-section which we saw previously.  Note that the thalamus is the midline region of grey matter, that lies just medial to the globus pallidus and putamen.  Summary of the Diencephalon      The diencephalon includes:              Thalamus.        Hypothalamus.        Epithalamus (Pineal)        Subthalamus.              Of these, the thalamus is the largest, and is a midline structure comprised of two lobes connected by a midline interthalamic adhesion.  Subdivisions of the Thalamus  The thalamus connects to many parts of the cortex; you can think of it as a hub/relay for information going towards the cortex.          It also acts to filter the information that goes into the brain.        Hence, there are many subdivisions of the thalamus, which associate with different parts of the cortex.Categories of the Thalamic Nuclei  There are multiple nuclei in the thalamus, with different functions.  We categorize the nuclei in the thalamus by the cortical areas that they associate with.  Hence, as with the cortex, there are thalamic nuclei associated with:          Sensory      Motor      Association      Names of the Thalamic Nuclei  While the thalamic nuclei are categorized functionally, they’re named based on their anatomic location within the thalamus.  For example:          VA → Ventral Anterior Nucleus.      MD → Medial Dorsal Nucleus.      VPL → Ventral Posterior Lateral Nucleus.        Objective      Know the major subdivisions of the thalamus, their main connections and primary function.  Sensory Subdivisions of the Thalamus  There is a thalamic subdivision associated with every sensory modality in the cortex, with one exception.          OLFACTION GOES DIRECTLY INTO THE CEREBRAL CORTEX.      So every other sensory modality is relayed through the thalamus, with the exception of smell.        We’ll only be focusing on a subset of the sensory nuclei.  Examples of Sensory Nuclei:            Auditory Pathway → Medial Geniculate Body → Primary auditory cortex on superior temporal lobe.      Optic Tract → Lateral Geniculate Body → Primary visual cortex on the occipital lobe (either side of the calcarine sulcus).      Somesthetic from body → VPL (ventral posterior lateral) → primary somatosensory cortex in postcentral gyrus.      Somesthetic from head → VPM (ventral posterior medial) → primary somatosensory cortex in postcentral gyrus.        Sensory Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Associated Sense        Receives From        Goes To                            Medial Geniculate Body        Hearing        Auditory Pathway        Primary Auditory Cortex (superior temporal lobe)                    Lateral Geniculate Body        Vision        Optic Tract        Primary Visual Cortex (occipital lobe, either side of calcarine sulcus)                    VPL (Ventral Postero-lateral)        Somatosensory        Sensory innervation from BODY        Primary Somatosensory Cortex (post-central gyrus)                    VPM (Ventral Postero-medial)        Somatosensory        Sensory innervation from HEAD        Primary Somatosensory Cortex (post-central gyrus)            Motor Subdivisions of the Thalamus  Just like how sensory information from the rest of the body is relayed through the thalamus, motor output from the brain also goes through the thalamus.          We’ve already seen an example of this with the striopallidal pathways, which feed through the thalamus.        Examples of Motor Relay Nuclei:          VA (Ventral Anterior) → receives input from the globus pallidus (via the direct/indirect striopallidal pathways), and feeds back to the motor cortex.      VL (Ventral Lateral) → receives input from the cerebellum, and feeds back to the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex.        Motor Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Receives From        Goes To                            VA (Ventral Anterior)        Globus pallidus        Primary Motor Cortex                    VL (Ventral Lateral)        Cerebellum        Primary Motor Cortex &amp; Premotor Cortex            Association Subdivisions of the Thalamus  The association nuclei connect to some of the associations areas we saw in previous lectures.  Examples of Association Nuclei:          Anterior Nucleus → receives input from the limbic system (mammillary bodies), outputs to the cingulate gyrus.      MD Nucleus (Medial Dorsal) → receives input from the amygdala, outputs to the prefrontal cortex (~AMAA).      Pulvinar Nucleus → outputs to the parietal cortex (~PMAA).        Association Subdivisions of the Thalamus                    Subdivision        Receives From        Goes To                            Anterior Nucleus        Limbic System (mammillary bodies)        Cingulate Gyrus                    MD (Medial Dorsal)        Amygdala        Prefrontal Cortex (~AMAA)                    Pulvinar Nucleus                 Parietal Cortex (~PMAA)            Hypothalamus &amp; Pituitary Gland  Objective      Describe the location and major functions of the hypothalamus and epithalamus.    The hypothalamus is like the thalamus in that it has a number of sub-nuclei, which each have different functions.          It controls thirst, temperature, satiety, and neuroendocrine release (through the pituitary).      It also integrates with the limbic system to mediate an autonomic response to an emotional stimulus (eg. how you start sweating when you’re afraid).        We won’t be looking at this in detail in this block (most of this was covered in Endocrinology).The Epithalamus (Pineal Gland)  The epithalamus looks like a little tail popping out from the back of the thalamus.  Primarily responsible for circadian rhythms by secreting melatonin at night.  It knows that it’s ‘nighttime’ via light input from the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus.  Summary of the Hypothalamus &amp; Epithalamus      The hypothalamus lies below the thalamus. The optic chiasm (crossing of optic nerve fibres) covers most of the basal hypothalamus.    The hypothalamus has multiple nuclei involved in autonomic control, satiety, body temperature and fluid balance. It is not necessary to know the names and function of these all of these nuclei.    Then hypothalamus sends autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) outputs through nuclei in the medulla.    The pituitary gland is connected to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk (infundibulum).    The pineal gland (epithalamus) is located immediately posterior to the thalamus and superior to the superior and inferior colliculi of the midbrain.    The pineal receives light information through a relay in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Based on the level of light, the pineal secretes melatonin at night and is involved in the control of circadian cycles and sleep.

	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity II", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Name the cranial nerves, state where they originate in the CNS, outline their intracranial course, state where they exit from the cranial cavity and give their main functions.  Outline the sensory nerve supply of the dura mater.  Describe the intracranial course of the main arteries supplying the brain, name their main branches and state their areas of supply.  Define the term “Circle of Willis” and state its functional significance.  Outline the distribution of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries to the cerebral cortex.  State the origin and intracranial location of the middle meningeal artery and its significance in intracranial hemorrhage.Cranial Nerves  Objective      Name the cranial nerves, state where they originate in the CNS, outline their intracranial course, state where they exit from the cranial cavity and give their main functions.    12 (Pairs) of Cranial Nerves.  (VERY DIRTY) Mnemonic: Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, To Touch And Feel (a) Virgin Girl’s Vagina And Hymen.            O → Olfactory (CN I).      O → Optic (CN II).      O → Oculomotor (CN III).      T → Trochlear (CN IV).      T → Trigeminal (CN V).      A → Abducens (CN VI).      F → Facial (CN VII).      V → Vestibulocochlear (CN VIII).      G → Glossopharyngeal (CN IX).      V → Vagus (CN X).      A → (Spinal) Accessory Nerve (CN XI).      H → Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII).        Of these, 4 nerves carry parasympathetic innervation:          III → Oculomotor.      VII → Facial.      IX → Glossopharyngeal.      X → Vagus.        Some of these nerves play a role in our senses:          Olfactory Nerve (CN I) → smell.      Optic Nerve (CN II) → sight.      Facial &amp; Glossopharyngeal (CN VII, IX) → taste.      Vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) → hearing &amp; balance.      Functions of the Cranial Nerve  Unlike with the spinal nerves roots, where the dorsal roots are all sensory, and the ventral roots are all motor, the cranial nerves are a hodgepodge of motor and sensory innervation.  To remember these, use the following mnemonic:          Some Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Big Brains Matter Most.      Or, if you’re of the dirtier persuasion, you could use Big Breasts.        S → Sensory (smell).  S → Sensory (vision).  M → Motor (+ parasympathetic).  M → Motor.  B → Both.  M → Motor.  B → Both (taste + parasympathetic too).  S → Sensory (hearing and balance).  B → Both (taste + parasympathetic too).  B → Both (+ parasympathetic).  M → Motor.  M → Motor.Origins of the Cranial Nerve  Generally the lower numbers exit the brain more anteriorly, and the higher numbers exit the brain more posteriorly.          The exception is the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII); it actually exits anteriorly to XI.        Origins of the Cranial Nerves:          CN I → Olfactory bulb      CN II → Optic tract      CN III &amp; IV → Midbrain      CN V → Pons      CN VI-VIII → Pons/Medulla      CN IX, X &amp; XII → Medulla      CN XI → Spinal cord        CN V comes off exclusively from the pons; VI-VIII come off and the junction between the pons and medulla.Exits of the Cranial Nerves  I → Cribriform Plate.  II → Optic Canal.  III, IV, V1, VI → Superior Orbital Fissure.          This is easy to remember; all the nerves that move the eye, plus the branch of the trigeminal that provides sensory information near there.        V2 → Foramen rotundum.  V3 → Foramen ovale.  VII, VIII → Internal Acoustic Meatus.  IX, X, XI → Jugular Foramen.          Recall that the sigmoid sinus also runs through here, to become the internal jugular vein.        XII → Hypoglossal Canal.Summary of the Cranial NervesSensory Innervation of the Dura Mater  Objective      Outline the sensory nerve supply of the dura mater.    The dura mater has sensation, largely through the CN V (trigeminal).  Recall that the trigeminal nerve has 3 branches:          Ophthalmic (V1) → to the eye region.      Maxillary (V2) → to the maxilla.      Mandibular (V3) → to the mandible.        Their innervation of the dura mater however, is more complicated.          V1 → antero-medial dura, but also sneaks to the back of the head to innervate most of the cerebellar tentorium.      V2 → over where the maxilla would be.      V3 → near where the foramen ovale is (where the mandibular leaves).      Cervical Spinal Nerves → mainly from C2, C3, innervates the dura over the posterior fossa.      Arterial Supply of the Cranial Cavity  Objective      Describe the intracranial course of the main arteries supplying the brain, name their main branches and state their areas of supply.    There are 4 arteries (2 pairs) that supply the brain itself:          Anteriorly, 2 x Internal Carotid Artery, branching off the common carotids.      Posteriorly, 2 x Vertebral Artery, branching off the subclavians.        As we saw in MSK, the vertebral arteries go through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae, and enter the foramen magnum.  In addition, there is another pair of arteries that enters the skull, but doesn’t enter the brain:          2 x middle meningeal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, which is a branch off the external carotid.      The middle meningeal tracks along the inner surface of the skull, and supplies the meninges with blood.      Note that the middle meningeal runs near the thin pterion! This will be important later on.        Recall from ENT the branches of the external carotid:          Superior Thyroid.      Ascending Pharyngeal.      Lingual.      Facial.      Occipital.      Posterior Auricular.      Maxillary.      Superficial Temporal.        Mnemonic → Some Anatomists Like Freaking Out Poor Medical Students.          Of these, the middle meningeal comes off of the maxillary artery.        Arteries of the Cranial Cavity      4 vessels supply the brain:              2 x Internal Carotid Artery, coming off the common carotids.        2 x Vertebral Artery, coming off the subclavians.              2 other vessels enters the skull, but don’t supply the brain:              2 x Middle Meningeal Artery.            Foramina for the Cranial Vessels  The foramina through which the key vessels of the skull pass through are:          Carotid Canal → Internal Carotid Arteries.      Jugular Foramen → Internal Jugular Veins      Foramen Magnum → Vertebral Arteries.      Foramen Spinosum → Middle Meningeal Arteries.        The foramen spinosum is a tiny hole that’s lateral to the foramen ovale (which was where V3 went through).  What else goes through the jugular foramen?          Recall that the sigmoid sinus enters the jugular foramen, to become the IJV.      In addition to this, we also mentioned that cranial nerves IX, X, XI also go through the jugular foramen.        Correction → the original slide said that the internal carotid goes through the foramen lacerum. This is incorrect; it actually goes through the carotid canal (as mentioned above).          Although the foramen lacerum is close to the carotid canal, nothing actually goes through it, because in living people, it’s actually covered in cartilage.        Foramina for the Cranial Vessels      Carotid Canal → Internal Carotid Arteries.    Jugular Foramen → Internal Jugular Veins    Foramen Magnum → Vertebral Arteries.    Foramen Spinosum → Middle Meningeal Arteries.  The Circle of Willis  Objective      Define the term “Circle of Willis” and state its functional significance.    Circle of Willis → a circle of blood vessels formed between the 4 major arteries that feed the brain.          Slick setup; by having anastamoses between the cerebral arteries, there is collateral circulation if any of the 4 arteries are affected.      Good at compensating for the gradual occlusion of one vessel (eg. plaque accumulation), but insufficient for compensating for sudden changes (eg. a burst aneurysm).      Location → runs around the pituitary stalk and optic chiasm (very small). Above the cavernous sinus.        Anatomy of the Circle of Willis:          Posteriorly, the L &amp; R vertebrals combine to form the basilar artery.      This then splits to form 2 x posterior cerebral arteries.      Anteriorly, the L &amp; R internal carotids give off anterior cerebral arteries.      The posterior cerebral arteries connect to the ICAs via the posterior communicating branches.      The two anterior cerebral arteries connect via a single anterior communicating branch.      After the ICAs give off the anterior cerebrals, they continue as the middle cerebral arteries.        THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIES ARE NOT PART OF THE CIRCLE OF WILLIS.          See the figure; the middle cerebral arteries are not part of the circle itself.        Objective      Outline the distribution of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries to the cerebral cortex.    You can figure out the distribution of the cerebral arteries based on how they exit the Circle of Willis:          The anterior cerebral arteries exit straight out, so they supply the midline.      The middle cerebral arteries exit to the sides, so they supply the lateral brain.      The posterior cerebral arteries reflect backwards, so they supply the posterior and inferior brain.        Note that the middle cerebral arteries are considered the terminal branches of the internal carotid arteries, and the posterior cerebral arteries are the terminal branches of the basilar artery.Cranial Hematomas  Cranial hematomas can be classified into 3 groups, depending on where the blood leakage occurs:          Epidural Hematoma.      Subdural Hematoma.      Subarachnoid Hematoma.        Because the structures in each compartment difer, the causes of each differ as well.1. Epidural Hematoma  Objective      State the origin and intracranial location of the middle meningeal artery and its significance in intracranial hemorrhage.    Epidural Hematoma → blood in the epidural space (between the dura mater and the skull).  Cause → Typically due to a fracture at the pterion, which tears the middle meningeal artery.          Recall that the pterion was the thinnest part of the skull, and that it’s nearby the path of the middle meningeal.      This causes filling of the potential space between the dura and skull.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          The classic presentation is that the person passes out, but then come-to and seem normal (lucid interval).      Gradual compression of the brain then results in coma.      Without relief of the pressure, the central structures of the brain will try and herniate through the foramen magnum.      This compresses the structures that control your breathing, which can lead to respiratory failure.      2. Subdural Hematoma  LESS COMMON THAN A SUBARACHNOID OR EPIDURAL HEMATOMA.  Subdural Hematoma → blood in the subdural space (between the arachnoid and dura mater).  Cause → Sudden acceleration-deceleration of the brain parenchyma.          Results in tearing of the reflections of the meningeal layers of the dura mater.      This can also tear the bridging veins, which transmit blood from the cerebral veins in the subarachnoid space up to the venous sinuses (which lie between the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura).      This results in venous leakage into the subdural space.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          The seepage of blood here is generally slower since it’s of venous origin.      Symptoms may appear weeks after the injury.      3. Subarachnoid Hematoma  Subarachnoid Hematoma → blood in the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater).  Cause → Typically due to a ruptured aneurysm; typically saccular/berry aneuryms (round outpouchings).          Recall that the cerebral vessels and the CSF run in the subarachnoid space.        Signs &amp; Symptoms:          “Thunderclap” headache → extremely intense.      Nausea, vomiting, LOC.      Neck stiffness due to increased pressure on the meninges.      Visual changes.        Summary of Hematomas                    Type        Location        Cause        Symptoms                            Epidural        Between skull and dura mater        Fracture of pterion, resulting in tearing of the middle meningeal artery        Brief lucid interval followed by coma                    Subdural        Between dura mater and arachnoid mater        Acceleration-deceleration injury, resulting in tearing of the bridging veins        Often slow progression since venous flow is slower                    Subarachnoid        Between arachnoid mater and pia mater        Ruptured aneurysm, typically of a cerebral artery        Thunderclap headache, severe nausea, vomiting, LOC            Hydrocephalus  Hydrocephalus → ‘water in head’.          Caused by conditions where the CSF that’s produced in the brain can’t escape.      The accumulation of CSF puts pressure on the brain, which can cause serious consequences.      In patients &lt; 2 y/o with hydrocephalus, the sutures haven’t fused yet so the skull can expand to accomodate this growth.      This results in the infants that you see with massive skulls.        Hydrocephalus can be categorized as 2 types:          Non-communicating (aka. Obstructive) → the CSF can’t reach the subarachnoid space.      Communicating (aka. Non-Obstructuve) → the CSF can reach the subarachnoid space, but can’t drain into the venous sinuses via the arachnoid granulations.      Obstructive Hydrocephalus  Also known as non-communicating hydrocephalus.  Here, the CSF made in the ventricles can’t get out into the subarachnoid space.          As a result, the ventricles dilate due to continued CSF production and accumulation.      This pushes the cerebrum against the skull and flattens the gyri.      Non-Obstructive  Also known as communicating hydrocephalus.  Here, although the CSF can reach the subarachnoid space, the arachnoid granulations can’t drain the excess CSF.          This is usually a consequence of a bleed or meningitis, which scars the meninges.      This scarring blocks outflow of CSF via the arachnoid granulations.      Since the CSF can get into the subarachnoid space, but can’t get out, it ends up pushing the brain from the outside.        Intead of pushing the brain OUT from within (obstructive), here you’re pushing the brain IN from outside.          This is conceptually analogous to a subarachnoid hematoma.        Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus:          In some patients, the excess CSF distributes in the subarachnoid space so uniformly that there isn’t a marked rise in the ICP.      This is referred to as a normal pressure hydrocephalus.      In these patients, symptoms can be very non-specific: gait disorder, incontinence, dementia. In other words, it’s almost impossible to differentiate from old age!        Summary of Hydrocephalus                    Type        Cause        Result                            Obstructive (Non-Communicative)        CSF can’t get into subarachnoid space        CSF pushes the brain OUT from within                    Non-obstructive (Communicative)        CSF can get into the subrachnoid space, but can’t drain into the venous sinuses        CSF pushes the brain IN from outside            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/17/anatomy-cranial-cavity-2.html"},
	{"title": "Anatomy of the Cranial Cavity I", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define the neurocranium and name the bones and sutures contributing to it.  Define the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae and list the main osteological features of each.  Describe the meninges, their specializations (dural folds, venous sinuses, arachnoid granulations), their relationship to one another, and their clinical significance with respect to intracranial hemorrhage.The Neurocranium  Objective      Define the neurocranium and name the bones and sutures contributing to it.    The skull is classically divided into 2 parts:          Neurocranium → the part that holds the brain.      Viscerocranium → the bones of the face.        Calvaria → roof of the neurocranium.  Cranial Base → floor of the neurocranium.Osteology of the Neurocranium  The bones of the neurocranium include:          Frontal Bone → single.      Parietal Bone → paired.      Sphenoid → single bone; located in the middle of the skull.      Temporal Bone → paired.      Occipital Bone → single.        Some features on the inferior aspect of the neurocranium are as follows:  On the temporal bone:    The reason our bones have bumps (tubercles, tuberosities, etc), are due to the attachments of structures, which act to gradually pull on the bone.          External Auditory Meatus → your ‘ear hole’, one on each temporal bone.      Mastoid Process → can be felt as a ‘bump’ behind your ear, formed due to the pulling action of the sternocleidomastoid.      Styloid Process → very pointed, and pronounced. Called ‘styloid’ because it’s shaped like a pen.        On the occipital bone:          Occipital condyles → this is what articulates with the atlas (C1), and allows you to nod.      Foramen magnum → ‘big window’, through which your brain stem and spinal cord exits the cranial cavity.      External occipital protuberance → where some muscles of the neck (eg. trapezius), and the ligamentum nuchae attach.      Sutures of the Neurocranium  Sutures → joints between the flat bones of the neurocranium.          Once they fuse, they don’t move together, but they are still considered joints.        The sutures are as follows:          Sagittal suture → easy to remember; in the sagittal plane, between the two parietal bones.      Coronal suture → separates the frontal bone from the two parietal bones.      Lambdoid suture → shaped like a λ, separates the occipital bone from the two parietal bones.      Frontal/Metopic suture → only present in infants because the frontal bone arises from two parts, which fuse later on. The suture between them is the metopic suture.        The flat bones grow into the sutures without requiring a cartilaginous template.          Recall from ITM (long time ago!) that the flat bones of the head are formed by intramembranous ossification.                  With intramembranous ossification, the bone forms directly from a mesenchymal membrane, without requiring a template.          Contrast this with the long bones in our body (arms, legs), which are formed by endochondral ossification, where a cartilaginous model gets ossified later.                      When you’re an infant, you have soft parts in your skull called fontanelles, which are large membranous openings between the bones of the skull.          These allow the bones to glide over each other during birth, and allow for the skull to fit through the vaginal opening.      Fontanelles disappear within 18 months of birth.        The sutures in infants also remain open to allow for rapid brain growth in the first couple of years.Clinical Application  Craniosynostosis → premature fusion of the cranial sutures.          This results in reduced growth in the region where the sutures fused prematurely.      The most common example is where the sagittal suture fuses prematurely, resulting in a narrow head.      In cases where the metopic suture (between the two pieces of the frontal bone) fuses too early, you can end up with a pointy forehead.        Craniosynostosis will result in abnormal brain development, unless the affected sutures are released (involving surgery).Landmarks of the Skull  These landmarks indicate where sutures of different bones meet.  Examples include:          Bregma → the intersection between the frontal and sagittal suture.      Lambda → the intersection between the lambdoid and sagittal suture.      Pterion → at the blending of the sutures between the temporal bone, parietal bone, and sphenoid bone. Forms an H shape.        Of these 3, the most clinically important landmark is the pterion, because it’s structurally where the skull is the thinnest.The Cranial Fossae  Objective      Define the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae and list the main osteological features of each.    The cranial fossae are depressions in the internal cranial base, and are formed by different parts of the brain.  The cranial fossae are as follows:          Anterior → contains the frontal lobes.      Middle → contains the temporal lobes.      Posterior → contains the cerebellum and brainstem.It was called the sella turcica (the Turkish seat) because of its resemblance to a saddle used by the Turks which had supports in the front and back.        In the centre of the middle cranial fossae is the region where the pituitary is held (recall, the sella turcica).  The height of each of these fossa is in descending order: the anterior fossa is the most shallow, and the posterior fossa is the deepest.          So if you poured water into the anterior cranial fossa, it would cascade down into the middle, and then posterior fossae.        Summary of the Cranial Fossae      There are 3 fossa that comprise the cranial base.                      Fossa        Contains                            Anterior        Frontal Lobes                    Middle        Temporal Lobes                    Posterior        Cerebellum &amp; Brainstem            Anterior Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Frontal Bone (green).      Sphenoid Bone (red).      Ethmoid Bone (yellow).        Frontal Component:          Although the frontal bone forms the front of the skull, it also reflects to form the roof of the orbit and the anterior cranial fossa.        Sphenoid Component:          The part in the anterior fossa is the lesser wing of the sphenoid, which is named relative to the greater wing, which you can see in the middle cranial fossa.      At the tips of the lesser wing of the sphenoid are the anterior clinoid processes (clinoid = bed post). These are also formed by the tugging of the dura.      In combination with the posterior clinoid processes in the middle fossa, these form a ‘4-poster bed’ that surrounds the pituitary.        Ethmoid Component:          The part of the ethmoid bone that forms the anterior cranial fossa is called the cribriform plate, which is named as such because it has many small holes that allow the olfactory nerves to get through to the nose.      Along the midline of the ethmoid is the crista galli (crest of the rooster), which sort of looks like a mohawk.                  The crista galli is formed by the tugging of the dura on the ethmoid.                    Middle Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Sphenoid Bone (red).      Temporal Bone (orange).      Parietal Bone (pink).        Note that the temporal bone has 2 parts:          Squamous → sheet-like; this is what we saw on the outside of the neurocranium.      Petrous → ‘like a rock’; this is the hardest bone in the body! The middle and inner ear are found here.        An important part of the middle cranial fossa is the sella turcica:          This is where the pituitary sits.      There are 3 parts which comprise the sella turcica:                  Hypophyseal fossa → aka. the pituitary fossa; this is the seat.          Tuberculum sellae → this is the anterior wall.          Dorsum sellae → this is posterior wall.                    Off the dorsum sellae are the posterior clinoid processes, which as we mentioned before, form a 4-poster bed along with the anterior clinoid processes.      Posterior Cranial Fossa  Comprised of 3 bones:            Temporal Bone (orange).      Parietal Bone (pink).      Occipital Bone (purple).        Key components in the posterior fossa include:          Foramen magnum → where the spinal cord and brain stem exit the cranial cavity.      Clivus → latin for slope; refers to the little slide down into the foramen magnum where the medulla sits.      Internal occipital protuberance.      Internal occipital crest.        As with the crista galli, the internal occipital protuberance and internal occipital crest are formed by the pulling of the dura.The Meninges  Objective      Describe the meninges, their specializations (dural folds, venous sinuses, arachnoid granulations), their relationship to one another, and their clinical significance with respect to intracranial hemorrhage.    The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord, and consist of 3 layers:          Dura mater → ‘tough mother’; the tough outer layer.      Arachnoid mater → beneath the dura; named as such because of the spidery, web-like appearance of its fibres.      Pia mater → ‘tender mother’; referred to as such because it is faithful/clining; it adheres closely to the brain.      Dura Mater  Tough mother.  Comprised of an outer periosteal and inner meningeal layer.  The meningeal layer actually pulls off of the periosteal layer and folds in on itself to produce folds.  There is a potential space between the dura and the skull, and between the dura and arachnoid mater.          Epidural space → between the dura mater and skull.      Subdural space → between the dura and arachnoid mater.        Generally, there is no space in either of these; however, they can get filled as a result of injury (eg. with a epidural or subdural hematoma).  Additionally, wherever the inner meningeal layer reflects to form a fold, there is a gap formed between the outer periosteal and inner meningeal layers.          Within these gaps are venous sinuses; this will be shown later on.      Arachnoid Mater  Spider-like.  Thin, transparent membrane.  Covers the brain, but does not enter the sulci.  Separated from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space.  Unlike the epidural and subdural space, the subarachnoid space is a realized space.          The CSF and cerebral arteries and veins are located in the subarachnoid space.        In addition, there are arachnoid granulations, which are projections that pop through the dura mater and interact with the venous sinuses there.          These function to drain excess CSF, in order to maintain the intracranial pressure.      Pia Mater  Faithful, clinging.  Thin, delicate membrane.  Adherent to the surface of the brain → unlike the arachnoid mater, this goes into the sulci.Meningitis  Meningitis → inflammation of the meninges.          Typically caused by a virus, but can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, and even some drugs.        Symptoms: headache, fever, drowsiness.  Can lead to: inflammation and sepsis, coma, death.Signs of Meningitis  Kernig’s Sign → straight leg raises causes marked pain/discomfort in the neck.  Brudzinski’s Sign → the opposite; here, you lift up the neck, and the legs involvuntarily lift up.  Nuchal Ridigity → an inability to flex the neck due to rigid muscles.  Lumbar Puncture → take a sample of the LSF.          Taken at the level of L4 (PSIS); recall from MSK that this is done to avoid the spinal cord.        Kernig’s sign and Brudzinski’s sign are highly specific, but not very sensitive; hence they’re good for ruling-in meningitis.  Summary of the Meninges      Meninges cover and help protect the brain    3 layers of meninges:              Outermost layer is dura mater        Middle layer is arachnoid mater        Innermost layer is pia mater              Potential space between dura mater and skull isepidural space    Potential space between dura mater and arachnoidmater is subdural space    Real space between arachnoid mater and pia mater issubarachnoid space               This is where cerebral arteries and veins and CSF run              Meningitis = inflammation of meninges.  Dural Folds  As mentioned previously, the inner meningeal layer of the dura mater separates from the outer periosteal layer to form folds.  These function to separate regions of the brain, and prevent the brain from moving around too much.  The largest and most important fold is the cerebral falx; this is a fold that separates the L and R hemispheres of the brain.          Attaches to frontal crest, crista galli, internal occipital protuberance and the midline of the calvaria.        In addition, there is the cerebellar tentorium.            It’s named as such because it acts as a tent for the cerebellum.      This separates the cerebellum from the cerebrum.      Continuous with the cerebral falx.      There is a ‘tentorial notch’ anteriorly that allows the brainstem to pass through.        Other dural folds include:          Sella Diaphragm → forms a roof over the pituitary, with a small opening for the infundibulum (pituitary stalk). Like a blanket over the pituitary (to go along with the 4-poster bed).      Cerebellar falx → similarly to the cerebral falx, this partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres.        Summary of Dural Folds                    Name        Location                            Cerebral Falx        Between the L and R hemispheres of the cerebral cortex                    Cerebellar Tentorium        Forms a ‘tent’ over the cerebellum                    Sella Diaphragm        Covers the pituitary; small opening for the stalk                    Cerebellar Falx        Partially separates the cerebellar hemispheres            Venous Drainage of the Cranial Cavity  As mentioned before, these form between the outer periosteal and inner meningeal layers of the dura; hence, they’re surrounded by dura mater.          Large veins from the brain empty into sinuses which ultimately drain into the internal jugular veins (IJV).      In addition, the veins also serve to receive CSF from the arachnoid granulations (mentioned previously).        Along the cerebral falx, there are 2 important venous sinuses:          Superior sagittal sinus → along the top fold.      Inferior sagittal sinus → along the bottom fold.        The superior sagittal sinus travels all the way to the back of the head, to the confluence of the sinuses.  The inferior sagittal sinus stops at the anterior border of the cerebellar tentorium, and then connects to the confluence via the straight sinus.  From the confluence of the sinuses, the blood then goes transversely through the transverse sinuses, and then through a s-shaped sigmoid sinus.  Finally, they exit through the jugular foramen.          Aptly, once the sigmoid sinuses leaves the jugular foramen, they’re no longer called sigmoid sinuses, but  instead called internal jugular veins.        The arachnoid granulations are located primarily along the superior sagittal sinus, and also in lateral offshoots called lateral venous lacunae.  As mentioned before, this is where excess CSF leaves the cranial cavity.  Because of the pressure created by these lacunae, you can actually see depressions on the inside of the skull!   Venous Drainage of the Skull      There are 2 main sinuses along the skull; the superior sagittal sinus, and the inferior sagittal sinus.    The superior sagittal sinus drains directly into the confluence; the interior sagittal sinus drains indirectly via the straight sinus.    Once blood reaches the confluence, it travels along the side of the skull via transverse sinuses, and then into an s-shaped vessel called the sigmoid sinus.    The sigmoid sinus passes through the jugular foramen; once it passes this, it’s now known as the internal jugular vein.  The Cavernous Sinus  The cavernous sinus is probably the most clinically important sinus.          Unlike the other venous sinuses, which form tubes, this is more of a plexus.                  As a result, blood in the cavernous sinus is more sluggish, and is more prone to infection.                    In addition, the cavernous sinus is an important area of venous communication; it connects to a number of places outside the cranial cavity, such as the face, jaws, etc.      POTENTIAL ROUTE FOR INFECTION → an infection can start from outside the neurocranium, and get inside via the cavernous sinus!        Clinical Examples:            One example of how an infection can track into the brain is via the facial vein, which communicates with the ophthalmic vein, which then communicates with the cavernous sinus.      As a result, an infection in the danger triangle (shown right), can track into facial vein → ophthalmic vein → cavernous sinus → meningitis.      So if you’re really unlucky, and you have a gruesome pimple there, you could get meningitis!!      Another example is with a tooth infection, which could track to the pterygoid venous plexus → cavernous sinus → infection.      The petrosal sinuses are named as such because they relate to the petrosal portion of the temporal bone.  The cavernous sinus communicates with the rest of the sinuses of the skull via petrosal sinuses.          Superior petrosal → runs along the border of the middle and posterior cranial fossae, and enters the sigmoid sinus.      Inferior petrosal → typically drains into the internal jugular (past the jugular foramen), but sometimes drains into the sigmoid instead.        Importantly, everything leaves through the jugular foramen.  Remember      The cavernous sinus is an important route through which an infection could track into the brain.    It drains via superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, into the sigmoid sinus/IJV.  Relations of the Cavernous Sinus  The cavernous sinus lies around the sella turcica and pituitary; hence it’s near a lot of vulnerable structures.  These include:          Optic tract.  Interestingly, the internal carotid artery actually runs through the cavernous sinus (an artery runs through a vein)! This is the only place in the body where this happens.      Internal carotid artery      Abducens (CN VI) → runs with the ICA.      Oculomotor (CN III)      Trochlear (CN IV)      Ophthalmic (V1 of Trigeminal)      Maxillary (V2 of Trigeminal)        So what could happen with a cavernous sinus infection?          Problems with eye tracking (CN III, IV, VI).      Abnormal sensation in the ophthalmic and maxillary regions (V1 &amp; V2).      If the infection came from the ophthalmic vein, then eye problems may be seen too.        These symptoms are described as Cavernous Sinus Syndrome:          Presentation → think of the surrounding structures:                  Orbital or facial pain, orbital swelling and chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), fever, oculomotor neuropathy, trigeminal neuropathy.                    Causes → anything in or nearby the cavernous sinus.                  Typically from cavernous thrombosis, due to infection.          Also can be caused by carotid aneurysms (ICA runs through cavernous sinus), carotid-cavernous fistulas, meningiomas, or pituitary tumours.                      Cavernous Sinus Syndrome      Caused by anything that causes pressure near the cavernous sinus.    The symptoms that it causes can be deduced from the surrounding anatomy:              Internal Carotid Artery.        Motor Innervation to Eye → CN III, IV, VI.        Sensory Innervation to Upper Face → V1 and V2 of CN V.            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/17/anatomy-cranial-cavity-1.html"},

Through our neuroanatomy lectures, we’ll be working from the top down, starting from the cerebrum.The CerebrumOverview of the Cerebrum  The cerebrum is comprised of 3 parts:          Cerebral cortex (aka. gray matter) → comprised of neurons.      Cerebral white matter → comprised of axons; this serves to connect different regions of the cerebral cortex and the subcortical structures.      Deep gray matter → made up of the basal ganglia.        The cerebral cortex is split into 2 hemispheres, the L and R hemisphere.  In humans, we have a gyrencephalic brain (the cortex has folds), while in smaller mammals like rodents, they have a lissencephalic brain (the cortex is smooth).          Another important differentiator is the amount of cerebral white matter; humans have significantly more neural interconnections.        Remember      The cerebrum is comprised of (1) cerebral cortex, (2) cerebral white matter, and (3) deep gray matter.    The cerebral cortex is comprised of neurons; the cerebral white matter is comprised of axonal interconnections.  Overview of the Cerebral Hemispheres  The two cerebral hemispheres is the largest part of the brain; it comprises 83% of the total brain mass.  Different regions have different functions:          Sensory.      Motor.      Multi-modal Association Areas (perception &amp; interpretation).        The surface of the cerebral cortex has grooves and ridges.          Gyri = ridges.      Sulci = grooves.        When a sulcus is particularly deep, it’s instead referred to as a fissure.  Some of these gyri and sulci are consistent between brains, and help provide an anatomical landmark to separate different regions.Lobes of the Cerebrum  The cerebrum has 5 lobes (paired):          Frontal.      Parietal.      Temporal.      Occipital.      Insular (hidden; insulated)        The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by the central sulcus.  The frontal and temporal separated by the lateral (sylvian) fissure.  The occipital and parietal lobes are aptly separated by the parietal occipital sulcus.  The insular lobe is hidden beneath the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.          As shown to the right, if you reflect these apart, then you can see the insular lobe hiding underneath.      This is why the insular lobe is named as such; it’s ‘insulated’ by the other lobes.      Subdivisions of the Major Lobes  On either side of the central sulcus (separating the frontal and parietal lobes), are two gyri:          The precentral gyrus is the primary somatomotor cortex.      The postcentral gyrus is the primary somatosensory cortex.        Hence, the precentral gyrus lies in the frontal lobe; the postcentral gyrus lies in the parietal lobe.  Before the precentral gyrus, and after the postcentral gyrus, there are another two conserved grooves:          Precentral sulcus.      Postcentral sulcus.        This can be seen to the right; there are 3 sulci (precentral, central, and postcentral), and 2 gyri (precentral and postcentral).  This process of subdivision makes it possible to further classify components of each of the lobes (see right).          Although this may seem complicated, the naming is fairly straightforward.      For example, the frontal lobe can be split into a superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus, which are split by a superior and inferior frontal sulcus.      You don’t need to remember these subdivisions.        Brodmann Classification → this was an attempt to classify the areas of the brain based on their cellular composition; 52 distinct areas were identified.Development of the Cerebral Cortex  The cerebral cortex and lateral ventricles developed originally as a c-shaped structure.  More details are described in the IL; you have to do it; it will be tested!  Key Points on the Cerebrum      The cerebrum is composed of:              Cerebral cortex (gray matter) → neurons.        Cerebral white matter → axons.        Deep gray matter → basal ganglia.              Different anatomic regions of the cerebral cortex have different functional roles; functions include:              Sensory.        Motor.        Multi-modal association (perception, interpretation.)              Gryi = ridges, sulci = folds. Deep sulci are known as fissures.    The cerebral cortex and the lateral ventricles formed a c-shape during development.    Key Points on the Cerebral Lobes      The (paired) lobes of the cerebral cortex include:              Frontal Lobe        Parietal Lobe        Temporal Lobe        Occipital Lobe        Insular Lobe              The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by the central sulcus.    The parietal and occipital lobes are separated by the parietal occipital sulcus.    The temporal and frontal/parietal lobes are separated by the lateral (sylvian) fissure.    The insular cortex is buried beneath the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes and can be seen if these lobes are pulled out of the way.    Anterior to the central sulcus is the precentral gyrus, which is the primary motor cortex.    Posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus, which is the primary sensory cortex.    The major lobes can be subdivided based on the prominent sulci that they contain and their location on the lobe (superior, middle or inferior positions on the lobe). Brodmann mapped 47 different regions of the cortex.  Sensory Regions of the Cortex  The sensory regions of the cortex are ALL located behind the central sulcus.  In addition to the postcentral gyrus which we mentioned previously, there are other key sensory regions.  These sensory regions can either be classified as primary, or secondary.          Primary sensory areas are responsible for the reception of sensory information.      Secondary sensory areas are responsible for the processing of sensory information.        For instance, the primary visual cortex is a primary sensory area. It’s responsible for the reception of visual information, but not it’s interpretation (eg. it doesn’t mediate object recognition).  Object recognition is instead mediated by the visual association area, which is a secondary sensory area.Primary Sensory Areas of the Cortex  In addition to the primary somatosensory area (the postcentral gyrus, which we mentioned earlier), there are a few other primary sensory areas of the cortex:          Primary visual cortex → located at the very back of the occipital lobe. This is responsible for the reception of visual information, but not it’s interpretation (eg. it doesn’t mediate object recognition).      Primary auditory cortex → lies on the superior aspect of the temporal lobe, near the primary somatosensory cortex.      Gustatory Cortex → this is responsible for taste, and it lies at the very bottom of the primary somatosensory area.      Visceral Cortex (not shown) → this is where visceral information is fed to. It’s not seen on the diagram because it’s located on the insular cortex.      Secondary Sensory Areas of the Cortex  Information flows from the primary sensory areas (which receive information), to the secondary sensory areas (which make sense of the information).  Secondary sensory regions of the cortex include:          Somatosensory Association Cortex → responsible for interpreting touch, vibration, and proprioception information. Located just behind the primary somatosensory area.      Visual Association Area → responsible for interpreting visual information. Located just in front of the primary visual cortex.      Auditory Association Area → responsible for identifying auditory information, but not speech comprehension.      Wernicke’s Area → the auditory association area feeds into Wernicke’s area, where speech comprehension takes place.                  In 90% of individuals, Wernicke’s area is on the left side.          So what is the corresponding region on the right side being used for? Studies suggest that it’s also somewhat involved in speech, but also plays a big role in understanding emotional context.    Classically, the olfactory cortex is referred to as a ‘primary’ sensory area, but evidence suggests that the olfactory bulb itself has a primary function, and the olfactory cortex plays a larger role in association. See here.                    Olfactory Cortex (not shown) → this isn’t easily seen on the exterior of the cortex; it’s located on a medial bulge on the temporal lobe called the uncus.        Also shown to the right is the calcarine sulcus, which extends into the brain.  This is important because the primary visual cortex runs on either side of the calcarine sulcus.  The part that can be seen on the outside of the cortex is only a small part of the actual visual cortex.Summary of the Sensory Areas of the Cortex  Primary Sensory Regions                    Name        Location        Function                            Primary Somatosensory Area        Postcentral Gyrus        Reception of touch, vibration, proprioception info                    Primary Visual Cortex        Back of the Occipital Lobe        Reception of visual information                    Primary Auditory Cortex        Top of temporal lobe, near primary somatosensory area        Reception of auditory information                    Gustatory Cortex        Bottom of the primary somatosensory area        Reception of taste information                    Visceral Cortex        Insular lobe        Reception of visceral information              Secondary Sensory Regions                    Name        Location        Function                            Somatosensory Association Cortex        Posterior to the postcentral Gyrus        Interpretation of touch, vibration, proprioception info                    Visual Association Area        Anterior to primary visual cortex        Integration of visual information                    Auditory Association Area        Posterior to primary auditory cortex        Interpretation of auditory information, but not speech recognition                    Wernicke’s Area        Deep to auditory association area, generally on the left side (ie. right-brain-dominant people)        Speech interpretation                    Olfactory Cortex        Medial bulge on temporal lobe (uncus)        Interpretation of olfactory information            Motor Regions of the Cortex  The motor regions of the cortex are ALL located in front of the central sulcus.  Motor regions of the cortex include:          Primary Motor Cortex → contains pyramidal cells, which send impulses to spinal cells and and out to muscles in order to produce movement.      Premotor Cortex → as the name suggests, is located anterior to the primary motor cortex.                  Just like how the somatosensory association cortex integrates information from the primary somatosensory area, the premotor cortex helps plan and coordinate more complex movements.                    Broca’s Area → the ventral part of the premotor cortex, which specifically controls movements necessary to speech.                  Broca’s area is dependent on Wernicke’s area. Although Broca’s is needed for speech, Wernicke’s is necessary for you to understand what you want to say.          Hence, in order to have proper speech, you need both Broca’s and Wernicke’s area to be functional.                      Summary of the Motor Areas of the Cortex                    Name        Location        Function                            Primary Motor Cortex        Precentral Gyrus        Contains pyramidal cells which send impulses down to muscles                    Premotor Cortex        Anterior to the primary motor cortex        Helps plan and coordinate complex motor movements                    Broca’s Area        Ventral part of premotor cortex        Control of muscles involved in speech            Sensory &amp; Motor Homunculi  In both the primary somatosensory cortex (the postcentral gyrus), and the primary motor cortex (the precentral gyrus), there are anatomic regions that map to different body parts.          These maps are referred to as homunculi.      For both the sensory and motor homunculi, their orientation is upside down; that is, the region corresponding to the feet is at the top of the brain, and the region corresponding to the head is at the bottom.        The size of each region of these primary cortices relates to the sensitivity or dexterity of the corresponding body part.          On the somatosensory side, it relates to the sensitivity of that part of the body (the digits and lips are more heavily weighted; the trunk is less heavily weighted).      On the motor side, it relates to the dexterity of that part of the body (the face and hand is heavily weighted; the legs are less weighted).        Importantly, the somatosensory and somatomotor control is crossed.          That is, the left somatosensory cortex receives sensory information from the right side of the body, and vice versa.      Similarly, the left motor cortex sends instructions to the right side of the body.      Multimodal Association Areas  Although the secondary sensory areas of the cortex let you interpret information from different senses, they don’t allow for the integration of this information.  Multimodal association areas resolve this by allowing for the integration of multiple modalities. These include:          PMAA → Posterior Multimodal Association Area.      AMAA → Anterior Multimodal Association Area.      Limbic Region        PMAA (Posterior Multimodal Association Area)          Also known as the general association or Gnostic cortex.      Located on the temporal + parietal lobes.      Since it’s on the posterior cortex (near all the sensory regions), it’s involved in the integration of sensations (tactile, visual, etc).      Gives you an awareness of the spatial location of the body, how to move your body through space, and to make sense of the environment.      This is also where we generate ideas on what we want to do.      Note that the PMAA receives processed information from the secondary sensory areas.        AMAA (Anterior Multimodal Association Area)          Receives information from PMAA, integrates it with past experience, evaluates options, and selects an appropriate response.      Includes your working memory.      Involved in personal and social interactions.      Executive area for task management.        Limbic Region          Responsible for memory and emotion.      Will be saved for a later lecture.      Within cerebral cortex, key region involved is the cingulate gyrus, which is c-shaped and lies right on top of this band of fibres called the corpus callosum, which connects the L &amp; R hemispheres.      Flow of Information Through the CortexFibre Connections of the Cerebrum  The fibre connections of the cerebrum form the white matter; they’re comprised of axon bundles.  Depending on the starting point and the ending point of these fibres, they are given different names.  Generally speaking, there are 3 types of fibres:          Association Fibres.      Commissural Fibres.      Projection Fibres.        Association Fibres are fibres that connect two regions that are in the same hemisphere. They can either be short or long:          Short → an association fibre that starts and ends in the same lobe.      Long → an association fibre that travels between lobes.        Commissural Fibres are fibres that travel between the two hemispheres.          The largest bundle of these is a commisural fibre pathway known as the corpus callosum.      It is the main connection between the left and right hemispheres of the brain.        Projection Fibres are fibres that connect the cerebral cortex to the subcortical structures.          These are the fibres that connect the cortex to the rest of the brain.      Afferent fibres heading to the cortex, and efferent fibres leaving the cortex merge in a large bundle of fibres called the internal capsule, which distributes to the subcortical parts of the brain.      When the internal capsule reaches the cortex, the fibres branch out to connect to different regions; this forms what’s known as the corona radiata.        Summary of White Matter      There are 3 types of fibres in the brain:              Association Fibres → between regions on the same hemisphere of the cortex.                      Short association fibres → between regions on the same lobe, on the same hemisphere.            Long association fibres → between regions on different lobes, on the same hemisphere.                          Commissural Fibres → between regions on different hemispheres.        Projection Fibres → between the cortex and the subcortical regions.            ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/anatomy-cerebrum.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Neuroanatomy", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Know and understand the basic functions of the nervous system and the divisions responsible for these functions.  Know the anatomical parts of a neuron, the types of neurons and support cells and compare the types of neurons found in the nervous system.Functional Neuroanatomy  CNS (Central Nervous System) → brain &amp; spinal cord.           Functions as an integration and command centre.        PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) → nerves &amp; ganglia.          Acts as a communication link between the CNS and the end organs.        Divisions of the PNS            Sensory aka. afferent (inward) division      Motor aka. efferent (outward) division      Both the sensory and motor divisions of the PNS can be subdivided into somatic and visceral systems:                  Somatic (innervate areas which interact with the environment).          Visceral (innervate areas within your body); also called autonomic.                    The visceral (autonomic) motor system can be further divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.        Somatosensory innervation includes touch sense, vibration sense, and proprioception.Example  Below is an example of how the brain elicits visceral motor changes, namely cardiovascular change in response to mental stress.  In the population, there are 2 different populations of people, that react to stress differently:          Cardiovascular reactors to mental stress      Cardiovascular non-reactors to mental stress.        A study done here in London, exposed these two groups to stress (eg. mental math).          Some students had a significant increase in HR; others did not.        What regions of the brain mediates the differences in this response?          DLPFC (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex) and INS (insular cortex) activity was seen in non-reactors, none was seen in reactors.        Summary of Functional Neuroanatomy      The nervous system is responsible for many many simple andcomplex functions    The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinalcord and is an integration and command center.    The PNS is made up of nerves and ganglia and primarily a communication link.    The four major divisions of the peripheral nervous system are:              Somatosensory → afferent information from the environment.        Somatomotor → efferent commands out to skeletal muscles.        Visceral sensory → afferent information from organs and blood vessels.        Visceral motor → efferent output to the organs and blood vessels).              Visceral NS = autonomic NS.    Regions in the CNS are also responsible for these four components, while others are more involved in integrating responses  Anatomy of the Neuron  Dendrite → where impulses are received.  Axons → where impulses are sent through.  Cell Body.  Nucleus.  Myelin Sheath → insulates the neuron to increase conduction speed.Types of Neurons  Neurons are defined as unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar.  The distinction is based on the number of cellular projections from the cell body.   Unipolar neurons only have 1 projection, bipolar neurons have 2, and multipolar ones have multiple projections.          Multipolar Neuron                  99% of neurons.          Consists of many dendrites, and one long axon; hence there are multiple projections coming from the cell body.          Include motor neurons and interneurons (which mediate reflex arcs).                     Unipolar Neurons                  Sensory neurons.          Here, the cell body is connected to the peripheral processes by a single branch, so it is ‘unipolar’ (see below).          In the body, these cell bodies actually bunch together; this is what forms ganglia!                     Bipolar Neurons                  Seen with special sensory organs (such as the eyes).          Bipolar neurons are mainly located in the retina of the eye.                       Summary of Neuron Types                    Type        Characteristic        Examples                            Multipolar        Multiple projections from cell body        Motor neurons, interneurons                    Unipolar        One projection from cell body        Sensory neurons                    Bipolar        Two projections from cell body        Special sensory organs            Myelination of Neurons  Myelination allows for more rapid conduction of nerve impulses, by allowing the impulses to jump between interruptions in the sheath (Nodes of Ranvier).  This jumping is known as saltatory conduction.  Schwann cells create the myelin sheath in the PNS.  Oligodendrocytes create the myelin sheath in the CNS.  Not all nerves are myelinated ones; in cases where fast conduction isn’t required (eg. some visceral nerves), nerves aren’t myelinated.  Remember      Schwann cells create the myelin sheath in the PNS.    Oligodendrocytes create the myelin sheath in the CNS.    Neurons are fragile; they also need support cells.          These cells are known as astrocytes; they have a number of functions, including the buffering of glutamate and calcium.      The also form a neurovascular unit by communicating with the vasculature; this is the medium through which neurons are supplied.      Nomenclature of Neuronal Groupings  The naming of collections of neurons (or cell bodies) differs depending on whether you’re dealing with the CNS or PNS.          In the PNS, a collection of cell bodies is called a ganglia; in the CNS, a collection of cell bodies is called a nucleus.      In the PNS, a collection of neurons is called a nerve; in the CNS, there are many possible terms, including tract, fasciculus, column, funiculus, and lemniscus.        There is one notable exception; there is a large collection of neuronal cell bodies in the CNS called the basal ganglia, and not the basal nucleus.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/intro-neuroanatomy.html"},

Tips for this Course  A huge amount of information is covered in a very small time period.  Don’t skip the IL’s → they ARE on the exams (recall MSK…).  Learn your neuroanatomy well.  Prepare in advance.  Consider completing the practice quizzes and look at the additional resources.          There are 2 other sets of practice questions in the additional resources.        MSK &amp; Neuro integration problems are new this year.          Aim to integrate neuro and MSK issues and make things more integrative.        PCCIA: New topic; Social accountability.          New topic → Social Accountability.      Group Project → Development of a hospital policy on Physician Assisted Death.      Example Questions  What is pyramidal distribution weakness?          Here, leg flexor weakness &gt; leg extensor weakness.      If you have a brain/spinal cord problem (pyramidal aka Upper Motor Neurone weakness), you end up with this.                  In the arms, the flexors are stronger than the extensors, so the arms are bent.          In the legs, the extensors are stronger than the flexors, so the legs can’t bend well.                      What is the DDx for acute onset of aphasia (difficulty producing +/- understanding speech)?          Ischemic stroke.      Hemorrhagic stroke (intracranial hemorrhage).      Migraine aura.  When patients have a seizure in the part of the brain involving speech, then that part may be so exhausted that it can’t function normally.      Seizures (post ictal Todd’s deficit, will see later).      Psychogenic (intentionally/unintentionally ‘faking’ symptoms).                  Intentionally → Malingering.          Unintentionally → Conversion disorder.                    Suggested Resources  Cecil’s Essentials of Medicine → Very good resource.  Blumenfeld’s “Neuroanatomy through Clinical cases”          Chapter 2 is a good exam review.      Expensive (~ $100).      Useful Terms  Plegia → paralysis; essentially no voluntary movement.  Paresis → weakness.  Ataxia → difficulties with motor coordination.  Dominant hemisphere:          The hemisphere where language is housed (not necessarily )      Typically the left hemisphere in right handers.      With left handers, half of people will have a dominant right hemisphere, and the other half will have a dominant left (just like righties).        MCA → middle cerebral artery.          Common place for a stroke to occur.      An MCA stroke causes face and arm &gt; leg contralateral weakness, due to the arrangement of the neural homunculus.        Homunculus → a spatial mapping of the parts of the brain which control different parts of the brain.          The man in the motor cortex is ‘standing on its head’ (ie, the legs are controlled by the top of the brain, then the arms, then the face).      Motor Homunculus → areas which require finer detail have a larger neural representation (eg. face, hands); areas which require less (eg. feet) have a smaller representation.      Sensory Homunculus → different from the motor homunculus; sensitive regions like the lips and fingers are more heavily represented.        Different regions of the homunculus supplies different regions of the homunculus.                  ACA supplies the leg component.          MCA supplies the hand and face.          PCA supplies the eyes.                    ACA = Anterior Cerebral Artery.       MCA = Middle Cerebral Artery.      PCA = Posterior Cerebral Artery.      These 3 arteries come out from the Circle of Willis (which we’ll see later).      Imaging Axes  Just like what we saw with MSK:          Sagittal.      Axial (transverse).      Coronal (frontal).      General Approach to Neurological Problems  What is the problem? → History and P/E.  Where is the lesion? → localization.  What is the DDx?          Using key points on the history and the localization      What is the most likely diagnosis?      What should I not miss (treatable Dx, serious Dx)?        What investigations should be ordered?  Are treatments possible?Case Example  Case Summary      A 24 year old woman was physically fit and very healthy. One evening, she notices some tingling in both feet. Assuming she’s just over tired, she heads to bed. The next morning she stumbles after getting out of bed, and finds her legs feel very weak. She makes an appointment to see her GP the next day.    The next day, she cannot walk independently and needs to have support from her friend to walk. Her arms now feel weak and she has difficulty getting dressed.    In the GPs office, she has bilateral and relatively symmetrical weakness in her arms and legs. Her reflexes are absent. Her sensory examination is normal.    Key points:          Bilateral, symmetric weakness.      Reflexes are absent.      Sensory findings → tingling.      Sensory exam is normal.        What is the problem?          Subacute onset of progressive generalized weakness associated with areflexia and normal sensory exam, despite mild sensory symptoms.        Where is the lesion?          Not the brain nor the brain, recall that you would expect hyper-reflexia.      Hence this is a lower motor neuron problem, but probably isn’t due to a problem with the muscle, or neuromuscular junction, since there are sensory symptoms (tingling) as well.      Hence this is probably a peripheral nerve problem.        What is the DDx?          Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) until proven otherwise.        What shouldn’t you miss? (treatable, serious)          Acute spinal cord pathology (can cause shock and lead to paradoxical short term hyporeflexia).      Myasthenia gravis, inflammatory mypopathy, botulism, tick paralysis, etc.        What investigations should be ordered?          Nerve conduction study.      Lumbar puncture (LP).                  With GBS, will see albuminocytologic dissociation, which is pathognomonic.          This is an elevation in the CSF proteins, without an elevation in the WBCs (hence a ‘dissociation’).                      Are treatments possible?          IVIG → shortens the duration of symptoms, and gets them better faster.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/neurology/2015/03/16/intro-neuroscience-eye-ear.html"},
