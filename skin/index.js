No pus or granulomatous tissue. This is actually a bslood vessel benign tumour.Seborrheic KeratosisSebhorrheic Keratoses are a very common lesion.SCALDA: multiple brown scaly papules/plaques with a stuck on appearance on the trunk.This should be recognizable without biopsy, and is benign.This is due to benign epidermal proliferation.Pigmentation is due to the accumulation of melanin pigment.Skin TagsSkin Tags are also benign.Histologically, these are due to a protrusion of the epidermis and dermis.SCALDA: Soft, skin coloured, pedunculated papule/nodule.WartsWarts are often found on the fingers.Warts are caused by the Human Papilloma Virus &#8594; HPV.With histology, because of this, you should see viral inclusions.These are scaly, flesh coloured papule/nodule, with red spots.Blood vessels will come up from the dermis, which is what causes these red spots.Have both hyperkeratosis and acanthosis, similar to psoriasis and lichenification.Molluscum ContagiosumCaused by the pox virus.SCALDA: Multiple umbilicated skin coloured small papules.Similar to warts, you would expect to see viral inclusions.Actinic KeratosisDue to chronic sun exposure &#8594; are typically present on sun exposed skin.SCALDA: Multiple poorly-demarcated reddish brown rough scaly papules and plaques on sun damaged skin.This is a premalignant-squamous lesion &#8594; there&#8217;s a risk of this transforming into a SCC!Histologically, we see parakeratosis (nucleated hyperkeratosis).We also see atypical, dysplastic keratinocytes. Recall that keratinocytes are squamous cells.Hence, we see cellular dysplasia here &#8594; can become neoplastic!Epidermal CystsEpidermal cysts are the most common skin cyst.Seen most frequently everywhere except the scalp.Skin coloured, well circumscribed nodules.If you do an excision, you&#8217;ll see an epithelial lining, with cystic contents.In epidermal cysts, the cyst content is keratin.These cysts can often rupture, triggering inflammation and pain.Pilar CystsPilar cysts are the second-most common skin cyst.Seen most frequently on the scalp.The epithelial lining and keratin are different with pilar cysts, making them less vulnerable to rupture.Epidermal Cysts vs. Pilar CystsEpidermal CystsMost common skin cyst.Seen everywhere but the scalp.Prone to rupture and inflammation.Pilar CystsSecond most common skin cyst.Seeon on the scalp.Less prone to rupture and inflammation.Dermatofibroma", "tags": "", "loc": "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157117/notes/skin/jekyll/_site//2014/01/08/pathology-skin-rashes-tumors.html"},

Inflammation of the skin.Note that atopic dermatitis is a subset of all dermatitis/eczematous conditions.You&#8217;ll often see red scaly patches, with possible vesicles, exudates, erosions, or crusting.What&#8217;s other dermatosis/eczematous conditions are there?Atopic Dermatitis &#8594; most common.Nummular dermatitis.Seborrheic dermatitis.Irritant contact dermatitis &#8594; eg. diaper dermatitis due to stool/urine.Allergic contact dermatitis &#8594; eg. with poison ivy. Recall that this was actually due to a Type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction.Tinea.Scabies.Immunodeficiency.What is Atopic Dermatitis?Inherited, chronic, relapsing pruritic skin, with dry skin (xerosis), and acute/chronic inflammation.Patients will have a tendency to overproduce IgE &#8594; makes sense, since this is an atopic condition.What&#8217;s the prevalence of AD?Atopic dermatitis is seen in 10-25% of children, and 1-2% of adults.This is because most children grow out of atopic dermatitis.The incidence of dermatitis has been increasing recently, for unclear reasons (one candidate is the hygiene hypothesis).What psychosocial consequences of Atopic Dermatitis are there?AD is the leading cause of sleep loss in children.This affects growth and development, school attendance, grades, etc.Treatment also has a significant financial burden.What is the presentation of Atopic Dermatitis?90% of patients present before the age of 5.If you see a patient older than 5 with new-onset dermatitis, you should think of alternative diagnoses.As you age, the presentation of atopic dermatitis changes:As you get older, you have more chronic dermatitis.Lesions become less wet.The distribution moves from the extensor to flexural surfaces.Acute Dermatitis:Very wet, very red looking.Often, these will look very inflamed, with lots of crusting.Chronic Dermatitis:More lichenified and leathery.Will often see exaggerated skin markings.There&#8217;s almost no other disease that causes this type of lichenification &#8594; chronic dermatitis is almost pathognomonic for atopic dermatitis.Extensor SurfacesWhere AD is distributed in infants.One good way to remember this is to think of the locations where a child learning to crawl would touch the ground.The elbows, the knees, etc.You also see AD on the face in infants.Flexural SurfacesWhere AD is distributed in older children and adults.You see patches in the antecubital fossa, popliteal fossa, neck, wrists, ankles, buttocks.One good way to remember these locations is to think of them as the areas prone to sweating.RememberInfantile Atopic Dermatitis:Acute Dermatitis.Wet Lesions.Extensor Surfaces.Adult Atopic Dermatitis:Chronic Dermatitis.Dry Lesions.Flexural surfaces.What associated finding are there with atopic dermatitis?Pruritis &#8594; all patients with AD are itchy!If the patient doesn&#8217;t have itching, then they don&#8217;t have atopic dermatitis.This is often worse in the evening/night.Patients will also almost always have xerosis &#8594; dry skin.Icthyosis vulgaris is seen in half of patients with atopic dermatitis. This is &#8216;fish-scale&#8217;-like scaling of the skin, often on the wrists.Hyperlinearity of the Palms.Dennie Morgan Lines &#8594; recall that these were associated with atopic diseases. Eczema being one of them!Pityriasis Alba &#8594; white macules/patches on the cheek.Keratosis Pilaris &#8594; pink little follicular bumps.(A) shows Icthyosis vulgaris. (B) shows hyperlinearity of the palms. (C) shows Dennie-Morgan infra-orbital folds. (D) shows Pityriasis Alba. (E) shows Keratosis Pilaris.How do you diagnose Atopic Dermatitis?This is a clinical diagnosis based on the Hx and P/E.No other tests are usually required.To make this diagnosis, you have to have all 4 of the essential features:Pruritis &#8594; they gotta be itchy!Dermatitis &#8594; can be acute, subacute, chronic.Proper Distribution &#8594; extensor regions in infants, flexural regions in adults. Also, the groin and armpits (axilla) will be spared with atopic dermatitis.Chronic or Relapsing History &#8594; you should see exacerbations that come and go.As before, you should rule out mimickers of atopic dermatitis &#8594; recall that not all dermatitis is atopic dermatitis!You can use other characteristics such as the age of onset, and the morphological features described previously (icthyosis vulgaris, hyperlinearity, etc).I GIVE UP HERE!", "tags": "", "loc": "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157117/notes/skin/jekyll/_site//2014/01/06/pediatric-dermatoses.html"},
	{"title": "An Approach To Skin Examination", "text": "Lecture ObjectivesDevelop an approach to the assessment of a patient with a skin complaint.Discuss the importance of the full skin exam in a patient presenting with a suspicious lesion.Communicate to other professionals the nature of a skin disorder.Lots of this stuff will be on the image exam!The Skin HistoryAs usual, you should do the OPQRSTUV stuff, with respect to pain:O &#8594; Onset.P &#8594; Precipitating Factors &#8594; what makes it worse, what makes it better.Q &#8594; Quality of the Pain.R &#8594; Region/Radiation.S &#8594; Severity.T &#8594; Time &#8594; ie.

SizeHow big is the lesion?Eg. the lesion is 3 mm.2. ColourErythematous means red!Red, purple, or pink, often reflects blood.Brown reflects melanin or hemosiderin (iron deposition).Blue can be seen when there&#8217;s melanin in the dermis, or with some drugs.Orange reflects carotene (eating lots of carrots)!3. ArrangementLinear &#8594; in a line.Grouped &#8594; clustered together. Think of a crowd of people.Annular &#8594; ring-like. Think of a group of people holding hands.Morbilliform &#8594; measles-like &#8594; multiple lesions of multiple sizes and shape.Reticulated &#8594; lace-like pattern. Small circles with a central clearing. Think of this as lots of annular lesions stuck together.4. Lesion MorphologyWhen you describe the morphology of the lesion, you should describe:The primary lesion &#8594; what&#8217;s directly caused by the disease.The secondary surface changes &#8594; these are consequences of the primary lesion.Primary Lesion &#8594; caused by the disease.Macule &#8594; flat spot &#60; 1 cm.Patch &#8594; flat spot &#62; 1 cm.Papule &#8594; raised spot &#60; 1 cm.Plaque &#8594; raised spot &#62; 1 cm.Nodule &#8594; thicker raised spot. Think of a plaque like a thickened sheet, while a nodule is like a lump.Pustule &#8594; a papule with pus.Vesicle &#8594; fluid filled &#60; 1 cm.Bullae &#8594; fluid filled &#62; 1 cm.Secondary Surface Changes &#8594; consequences of the primary lesion.Exudate &#8594; weepy, pus oozing out.Crust &#8594; dried, scaly, crusty.Excoriation &#8594; fancy word for scratches. Can describe any scratching injury.Ulcer &#8594; well circumscribed with an internal depression.Erosion &#8594; loss of epidermis. Difficult to differentiate from excoriation, but thin of these as &#8216;less self-inflicted excoriations&#8217;.Fissure &#8594; a crack in the skin.Atrophy &#8594; an area of skin thinning. Often seen with hypopigmentation.Scale &#8594; hard to differentiate with a crust. Think of this as smaller, finer crustiness. Famously used with psoriasis (the archetypical silvery scale).5. DistributionWhere is the lesion localized to?Face.Trunk.Neck.Legs.6. Always check Hair and NailsYou&#8217;ll often find more clinically relevant information there!For instance, with Psoriasis, there will also be hair and nail changes.Primary Lesion MorphologyMacule &#8594; flat spot &#60; 1 cm.Patch &#8594; flat spot &#62; 1 cm.Papule &#8594; raised spot &#60; 1 cm.Plaque &#8594; raised spot &#62; 1 cm.Nodule &#8594; thicker raised spot.

SCALDA.&#8221;Case 151 y/o man, asymptomatic.&#8220;This is a 51 y/o man who is asymptomatic. On examination, the patient is a Fitzpatrick Type II.&#8221;SCALDA:Size &#8594; 11mm.Colour &#8594; erythematous.Arrangement &#8594; solitary.Lesion Morphology &#8594; nodule, no secondary changes.Distribution &#8594; nose (face).Always check hair and nails.Case 231 y/o woman, pruritic.&#8220;This is a 31 y/o woman who is pruritic. On examination, the patient is a Fitzpatrick Type II.&#8221;Which of the following is best?31 y/o female with a pruritic erythematous well-demarcated plaque with silvery scale on her posterior scalp.31 y/o female with itchy red poorly-defined area on the back of her head with some crusting.31 y/o female with pruritic erythematous patch with excoriations.31 y/o female with silvery scalp and erythema.This relates to how you differentiate psoriasis from eczema:Psoriasis is typically well-demarcated, while eczema is not.Silvery scale is pathognomonic for psoriasis.Case 3What types of lesions do you see?Papules, pustules, nodules, cysts.Papules, pustules, patches.Papules, pustules, hyperpigmented macules.Papules and pustules.Recall that papule = raised spot &#60; 1 cm, pustule = papule + pus, and a macule = flat spot &#60; 1 cm.Case 482 y/o man, occasional stinging.He has multiple confluent erythematous patches (flat), and some papules (some are raised and &#60; 1 cm), and some secondary crusting.Some excoriations are also present.This patient has actinic keratosis &#8594; extremely common.Actinic Keratosis = solar keratosis.Actinic &amp;rarr conditions affected by light exposure (especially UV light).Case 572 y/o man, non-healing.Non-healing, well-circumscribed, rolled borders, telangiectasia (exposed blood vessels), and central ulceration.This is characteristic of a basal cell carcinoma &#8594; cancer!It would be surgically removed.Would definitely do a complete skin exam to ensure that there aren&#8217;t any other lesions here!", "tags": "", "loc": "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157117/notes/skin/jekyll/_site//2014/01/06/approach-skin-examination.html"},

It&#8217;s literally the basement of the epidermis!RememberThe layers of the epidermis are:Stratum Basale (Base)Stratum SpinosumStratum GranulosumStratum CorneumRememberMelanocytes produce pigment.Langerhans Cells have immune function (recall that they are differentiated macrophages).Merkel Cells are responsible for our sense of touch.Skin TypesOur Palms/Soles are covered with a thick, compact stratum corneum, which increases protection.This compact stratum corneum is also why the palms and soles look whiter.Elsewhere, we have a thinner, less dense stratum corneum.Our Mucosa has no stratum corneum &#8594; the first layer is then the stratum granulosum!So our esophagus, or the lining or our mouth, would not have a stratum corneum.Instead, the only layers would be the stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.Summary of Skin TypesPalms/Soles &#8594; thick stratum corneumMucosa &#8594; no stratum corneumThe MelanocyteMelanocytes have a main body in the stratum basale, and dendritic appendages that spread through the entire epidermis.These dendritic appendages are used to transfer melanin, which is produced by the melanocyte, to the keratinocytes on the surface of the skin.Melanin is produced from tyrosine, and is transported via melanosomes.These melanosomes coat the keratinocyte, protecting the DNA from UV injury.What Determines Skin Colour?The melanocyte number does NOT determine skin colour.Instead, it&#8217;s the difference in the number of melanosomes/melanocyte.Darker skinned people will have more melanosomes per melanocyte.Fairer skinned people will have fewer melanosomes per melanocyte.The DermisThe dermis is split into two components:The upper papillary dermis.The lower reticular dermis.Both of these components have lots of collagen, elastic fibers, and ground substance, which confers elasticity to the skin.Blood vessels and nerves are also found in the dermis.There&#8217;s a superficial plexus in the upper papillary dermis.There&#8217;s a deep plexus in the lower reticular dermis.These plexuses play a critical role in regulating temperature:When you have a fever, and need to cool your body, there will be vasodilation of the superficial plexus, increasing blood flow, and increasing heat loss.Similarly, when you want to conserve head, there will be vasoconstriction of the superficial plexus.RememberThe vasculature in the dermis is critical in controlling temperature!Skin AppendagesSkin appendages are also referred to as adnexal structures. They include:Hair follicles.Sebaceous Glands.Nails, hair.The following are some disease states involving these appendages:1. Skin AcneAcne involves the pilo-sebaceous unit &#8594; the hair follicle and the attached sebaceous glands.Sebaceous glands produce sebum, which is a natural skin moisturizer.Normally, this production does not cause any problems, and the pilo-sebaceous unit looks like what&#8217;s seen on the right.In acne, there&#8217;s excess sebum production by the sebaceous glands, causing obstruction:This can be an open comedome, where the obstruction meets with the surace.This can be a closed comedome, where the obstruction is deep to the pore opening.Grossly, these will cause different types of acne:Open Comedomes will cause blackheads.Closed Comedomes will cause whiteheads &#8594; that&#8217;s why you get the urge to squeeze out the crap with a whitehead!When you rupture a closed comedome, you can cause inflammatory acne.The bacteria most commonly associated with acne is Propionibacterium acnes.RememberAn open comedome has a dilated follicle opening, and is associated with blackheads.A closed comedome has an closed follicle opening, and is associated with whiteheads.2. AlopeciaAlopecia &#8594; excessive hair loss.The normal hair growth cycle is:Anagen &#8594; growing phase.Catogen &#8594; regressing phase.Telogen &#8594; resting phase.More will be seen in the PCCIA small group.Epidermal ChangesThe Epidermal Desmosomes join keratinocytes together.Pemphigus vulgaris arises from an auto-immune reaction to Desmolgein 3 in the desmosome complex.The Epidermal Basement Membrane separates the epidermis from the dermis.Bullous Pemphigoid arises from an auto-immune reaction to BPAg1 and BPAg2 in the basement membrane complex.1. SpongiosisSpongiosis &#8594; acute intercellular edema.You see edema fluid creating microvesicles in the epidermis.This can occur in acute dermatitis.Clinically, this will present as juicy papules.2. HyperkeratosisHyperkeratosis &#8594; chronic thickening of the stratum corneum.This can present in two forms:Orthokeratosis &#8594; no nuclei in the cells.Parakeratosis &#8594; nuclei in the cells.Clinically, both of these will present with scale.3. AcanthosisAcanthosis &#8594; chronic thickening of the stratum spinosum.So this differs from hyperkeratosis in that it&#8217;s the straum spinosum that&#8217;s thickening now, and not the stratum corneum.Often, both hyperkeratosis and acanthosis will present together.Clinically, there are many skin conditions where we see both hyperkeratosis and acanthosis, including:Psoriasis, &#8594; a chronic plaque with a silvery scale.Lichenification &#8594; scaly skin.Psoriasis is seen above. Note the silvery scale, and the nucleated thickened stratum corneum (parakeratosis).Above is lichenification, which also presents with both hyperkeratosis and acanthosis.4. AcantholysisAcantholysis &#8594; loss of the desmosomal connection between keratinocytes, causing them to round up and separate.Clinically, this can be seen with pemphigus vulgarisRecall that pemphigus vulgaris is an auto-immune disease that attacts a component of the desmosome &#8594; this is why we lose the desmosomal connection!SummarySpongiosis &#8594; acute intercellular edema in the epidermis.Will present with juicy papules.Often seen with acute dermatitis.Hyperkeratosis &#8594; chronic thickening of the stratum corneum.Will present as scale.Acanthosis &#8594; chronic thickening of the stratum spinosum.Will also present as scale.When you have both hyperkeratosis and acanthosis, you can see:Psoriasis.Lichenification.Acantholysis &#8594; loss of desmosomal connections between keratinocytes.Will present with flaccid bulla with focal erosions.Seen with pemphigus vulgaris &#8594; auto-immune attack on a component of the desmosome.Review of Lecture MaterialWhich Cell Produces Melanin?The melanocyte.Name the gland involved in acne?The sebaceous gland &#8594; excess production of sebum.Name the odour producing gland?The apocrine gland.What&#8217;s the function of the Langerhan&#8217;s cell?The immune response &#8594; it&#8217;s a differentiated macrophage.Where is Vitamin D synthesized?In the epidermis or the dermis?In the epidermis &#8594; more precisely in the stratum basale and the stratum spinosum.", "tags": "", "loc": "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157117/notes/skin/jekyll/_site//2014/01/06/skin-structure-function.html"},
