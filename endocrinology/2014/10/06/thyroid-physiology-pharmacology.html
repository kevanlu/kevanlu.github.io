                <div class="body"><p><strong>Functional Anatomy of the Thyroid</strong>
- The largest endocrine organ.
- Composed of parafollicular cells surrounding a thyroid follicle.
	- Envision this as a bunch of houses surrounding a common backyard.
	- In the backyard, these’s a lot of Thyroglobulin.
- High molecular weight (660 KD).
- glycosylated
- 2 subunits
- <em>330 tyrosine residues</em> → important for producing T3 and T4.
harbours carrier protein used to produce tri-iodo-thyronine (T3)/thyroxine (T4)</p>

<h2 id="hpt-axis"><strong>HPT Axis</strong></h2>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4sm4d57annqq50o/mpl31r3t.png" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Think of this as a parafollicular cell in the thyroid gland.</li>
  <li>Job is to maky thyroid hormone.</li>
  <li>One key ingredient for this is <strong>iodine</strong>.</li>
  <li>So it needs to get iodine into the colloid (thyroid follicle), where thyroglobulin exists, to make T3 and T4.</li>
  <li>How do we get iodine across these follicular cells.</li>
  <li>We use something called the <strong>iodine trap</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NIS</strong> → sodium iodine symporter, uses Na<sup>+</sup> gradient to transport I- into the thyroid cell.</li>
      <li><strong>Pendrin</strong> transports I- into lumen for oxidative coupline to thyroglobulin.
TPO – thyroid peroxidase (iodinates/couples thyroglobulin (Tg) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2 processes.</li>
  <li>Iodin</li>
  <li>Thyroglobulin T3-T4 mixure bought back into follicular cells by pinocytosis.</li>
  <li>Then breaks apart thyroglobulin (by MIT and DIT), releasing T3, T4 into the blood.</li>
  <li>IODINE TRAP = symporters which bring into site of T3/T4 backyard.</li>
  <li>Colloid is another name for backyard, </li>
  <li>330 tyrosine residues from which we can make T3 and T4.</li>
</ul>

<p>Colloid - reservoir of materials for thyroid hormone production including Tg (thyroglobulin)</p>

<p>Two hormones are released from Iodinated Tg by intracellular enzymes:
pinocytosis
1. Triiodothryonine (T3) 
2. 2. Thyroxine (T4)</p>

<p>This is how it’s made, how is it enhanced? BY TSH.
Binding to receptor upregulates NIS to bring more iodine into the cell.
Also increases transglobulin production? More material to work with.
Increases TPO activity, main enzyme responsible for conjugating Tg to Iodine.</p>

<p>FUNCTION OF THYROID PEROXIDASE
Iodinate it once -&gt; Monoiodotyrosine.
Iodinate it twice -&gt; Diiodotyrosine.
Coupling Mono + Di can get Triiodothyronine (T3)
Or take 2 Diiodotyprosine (T4)</p>

<p>THYROID HORMONE CARRIER PROTEINS
Not water loving, lipid soluble.
So need a carrier protein.
1. MAJOR ONE IS THYROXING BINDING GLOBULIN (TBG)
Binds to 75% of circulating T3/T4.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>TransThyretin (TTR)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human Serum Albumin (HSA)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN T3 and T4.
T3 is about 10x more potent than T4.
The problem is that the half life of T3 is much shorter.
T4 = stable, less potent.
T3 functions as the active form of thyroid hormone, which is converted form the longer lasting, less effective, T4.</p>

<p>T3 is the active form of thyroid hormone
Conversion of T4→T3 carried out by cell specific deiodinases (D1-D4)</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4sm4d57annqq50o/he7504kg.png" /></p>

<p>WRONG- FIX THIS, SEE LATER DIAGRAM ON COOK’S PART.
Too much T4, T4 -&gt; T3.
Too much T3, T3 -&gt; reverse T3.
or -&gt; T2, less effective.
TR is a nuclear receptor, but more like a transcription factor that turns on/off specific genes.</p>

<h1 id="role-of-thyroid-hormones">Role of Thyroid Hormones</h1>
<hr />

<p>ROLE OF THYROID HORMONES
Early Growth and Development
•Required for GH secretion and action
•Essential for early neural development (via induction of NGF) 
•Maternal lack of T3/T4growth retardation and cretinism</p>

<p>Metabolic Activity
Increases mitochondrial growth, replication and activity; basal metabolic activity
Increased heat production, O2 demand, HR and SV
Stimulates Na+/K+-ATPase activity Increased metabolic demand (e.g. glucose)
Increases transcription of energy metabolism enzymes Increased lipolysis, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis leads to increased
blood metabolite levels and cellular uptake
T3/T4 is permissive to GH action and necessary for induction of PRL, GH, surfactant and NGF expression</p>

<p>LESS FAT&lt; LESS GLYCOGEN, MORE GLUCOSE = more accessible ATP.
NGF = neural growth factor expression.</p>

<p>ENDEMIC DEFICIENCIES OF THYROID HORMONES (T3, T4)
Because of a dietary deficiency in iodine.
We used to have that, but now we fortified our salts with iodine, which resolved that issue.
ENDEMIC GOITER -&gt; enlargement of thyroid gland.
Occurs because we don’t make normal T3/T4, so we have high levels of TSH, and there’s no negative feedback on the high level of TSH.
TSH results in hypertrophy of cells in the thyroid gland.
Leading to this goiter.
Tx by reintroduction of iodine, or IV T3/T4.</p>

<h2 id="hypothyroidism"><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong></h2>
<p>WHAT CAN GO WRONG.
Lack of energy
Slow heart rate..
Muscle cramping
Lack of concentration, poor memory
Puffy eyelids.
Feeling odd.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4sm4d57annqq50o/m7-ah_oz.png" />
HASHIMOTOs DISEASE
- Antobodies against TPO, thyroid peroxidase.
- Recall that TPO was what iodinated thyroglobulin.
- As a result, we have less T3/T4.
•Case 8 yr old, 3’6”, immature body phenotype
•1 yr later, 4’, body phenotype normal
Lots of fat deposition due to low basal metabolic rate.
TOOK A YEAR - SINCE THEY’RE SLOW ACTING, SO TREATMENT TAKES TIME.</p>

<h2 id="hyperthyroidism"><strong>Hyperthyroidism</strong></h2>
<p>Anti-TSH receptor antibodies—activating
- Feeling hot, icnreased sweating.
- Fast, strong, or irregular heart beat.
- Nervousness, trembling hands.</p>

<p>GRAVE’S DISEASE.
Anti-TSH receptor antibodies bind to the receptor
Leaves them ‘constitutively’ active → unbounded T3/T4 production.
• hand tremor
• insomnia
• hyperactivity
• protrusion of the eye • mood swings
• dizzyness</p>

<p>CALCITONIN.
Third, less known, thyroid hormone.
Important in fish, but to man?
SMall amino acid peptide.
Inhibits osteoclast acitivty in the long term.
Produced in the thyroid!? Wait, parathyroid?
Importantly, upregulated in medullary carcinoma.</p>

<p>Important to fish but, important to Man???
•34 amino acid peptide
•inhibits osteoclast activity (long term)
•↓ Ca++ tubular reabsorption
•??regulation of post-prandial hypercalcemia?? (rats)
No mention in Endotext.org, Thyroidmanager.org, MedlinePlus, etc.
Except………in reference to medullary carcinoma!</p>

<h1 id="thyroid-pharmacology">Thyroid Pharmacology</h1>
<hr />

<p>Recall, 2 forms of T3, one highly active.
The other one is inactive.
Why the difference?
Can have different binding locations of 3 iodines on the aromatic rings.
3,5,3’-tri-iodothyronine (T3) is a highly active thyroid hormone
3,3’,5’-tri-iodothyronine, (reverse T3 or rT3), is inactive.
Recall that iodine is a big atom. Ether oxygen has a bent shape.
So the 2 rings aren’t coplanar, they’re bent.
Because the two iodines into the bend, so big, causes them to twist.
That’s why the reverse T3 doesn’t quite fit the receptor, INACTIVE!</p>

<p>Notice the opportunities for stereoisomerism.
L and D series.
All active are L series hormones.
There is a D series thyroxine, which will be talked about soon.
* [D-thyroxine has lipid lowering properties]</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4sm4d57annqq50o/dkqzxvt6.png" /></p>

<p>See the *!</p>

<p>Recall that most T3 is produced in peripheral tissue, converted from T4.</p>

<p>Conversion (activation) occurs with 5’ deiodination of the outer ring of T4  T3 which becomes the biologically active hormone responsible for the majority of thyroid hormone effects</p>

<p>T4 may be considered a prohormone for T3</p>

<p>Conversion of T4 to T3 occurs in the liver (1), at kidney, and at other peripheral sites.
Conversion is stereoselective and involves a family of selenodeiodinases. Note the production of rT3
	Deiodinases, that require selenium within the structure of the enzyme to be active.
	So selenium is the prosthetic group here.
	In extremely rare instances of selenium deficiency, we have impaired conversion of T4 to T3.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/4sm4d57annqq50o/t94f8ut-.png" /></p>

<p>D1 and D3 are deiodinases. Different isoforms.
T3 is the main contributor to biological activity.
Inactivating D3 not only converts T4 to ianctive T3, but also T3 to inactive T2.</p>

<p>SO D3 is a INACTIVATOR!</p>

<hr />

<p>TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROIDISM
Replacement therapy is indicated in hypothyroidism.
	- It’s so GOOD that one of the treatments for hyperthyroidism is to remove the thyroid, and replace it with external thyroid hormone.
Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis)
Impaired hormone synthesis
Destruction of thyroid tissue (e.g. irradiation, surgery) Secondary to pituitary/hypothalamic disease (i.e. TSH deficit)
Congenital (cretinism)
Following consumption of antithyroid drugs or foods</p>

<p>The preparations available are either extracts of animal source thyroid tissue or are synthetic drugs. The latter are by far the most common.
Synthetic T4 (Levothyroxine, Synthroid®) is available in both tablet and parenteral formulations.
Synthetic T3 (Liothyronine, Cytomel®) is also available in both formulations.</p>

<p>Thyroid dessicated USP is an extract of bovine thyroid tissue. It is available in oral formulations
	Dessicated thyroid tissue is also available, source of a controversial opinion, will be mentioned in a moment (available on internet).</p>

<p>There are a wide range of tablet dosages available. Usual adult dose is ~100 g/d. 
(Kids: 100 g/m2/d) -&gt; adjusted by body surface area, since they’re smaller.
The synthetic drugs are manufactured to contain microgram (g) quantities of the hormones.
Thyroid extract on the other hand, contains milligram (mg) quantities of active material.
That’s a THOUSAND FOLD DIFFERENCE. So most of this actually isn’t thyroid hormone, it’s just other shit.
The extra shit is sources are bovine or porcine and the difference indicates the presence of considerable amounts of other material which may contribute to allergy
Woman has a website -&gt; STOP THE THYROID MADNESS. WOman has been advocating for almost a decade to take the dessicated thyroid tissue. Ahahahaa.</p>

<p>Thyroxine T4 (levothyroxine sodium) is the hormone of choice for replacement therapy because of its consistent potency and prolonged duration of action.
Absorption of thyroxine occurs in the small intestine and is variable and incomplete, with 50% to 80% of the dose absorbed. Absorption is increased when the hormone is taken on an empty stomach.
	Patients are counseled to take tablet in the morning, on an empty stomach.
Certain drugs may interfere with absorption of levothyroxine in the gut, including sucralfate, cholestyramine resin, iron supplements, calcium supplements and aluminum hydroxide.
	Calcium in dairy products can also affect absorption. So don’t take it after they’ve drunk milk.</p>

<p>Triiodothyronine T3 (liothyronine sodium) is used occasionally when a faster onset of action is desired e.g. in the rare presentation of myxedema coma
MOST OF THE ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE EXTENSION EFFECTS -&gt; Basically what they’d do normally, except in excess.</p>

<p>The adverse effects of the thyroid hormones are mostly extension effects. Allergy (natural products),
Check the consequences of thyroid hypersecretion or overdosage to see the range of potential problems .
The principal problems involve the cardiovascular system. Elevated levels of thyroid hormones give rise to
a syndrome resembling sympathetic hyperactivity
	This is what you should worry about.
	Mimic of sympathetic hyperactivity.</p>

<p>The activity of several other drugs is altered when thyroid hormones are given. This is usually because of the metabolic changes brought about by hormone activity  BMR
Other interactions occur following increases or decreases in plasma protein binding and following inhibition of 5’D-I
	- Any compound that is circulating bound to a plasma protein, is subject to competition by other molecules.
	- If the concentration of the other molecule is too high, they’ll be outcompeted, weill be free.
	- Or inhibition of de-iodinases. (look at this later).</p>

<h2 id="treatment-of-hyperthyroidism">Treatment of Hyperthyroidism</h2>
<p>Hyperthyroid conditions often require treatment with drugs which diminish the synthesis and/or release of the active thyroid hormones.
The processes involved in synthesis of the thyroid hormones can be modified by several different moieties including a specific group of drugs, the iodide ion, and certain other anions.
In addition to therapeutic use, some toxicological concerns arise.</p>

<p>A group known as the thioamides possess antithyroid properties. They are used in several hyperthyroid conditions such as Graves’ disease, Thyrotoxicosis, and Toxic Nodular Goitres.</p>

<p>The Thioamides inhibit:
The incorporation of iodide into tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin.
The coupling of MIT and DIT to form T3 and T4
Inhibition of these reactions leads to inhibition of hormone synthesis and to depletion of active hormone from the thyroid gland.
This process takes some time because of the need to deplete preformed and stored hormone.</p>

<p>After initial Dx, Pt usually put on MMI (Methimazole), but takes weeks to months before beings to take an effect!</p>

<p>Methimazole (MMI) is approximately an order of magnitude more potent than PTU.
Propylthiouracil (PTU) has a diminished ability to cross the placenta relative to that of MMI.
	- Better for pregnancy.
However, onset is faster. Why?
	- D1 deiodinase can be inhibited by PTU!
	- So it has a second effect of inhibiting T4-T3 conversion</p>

<p>Pendrin! Named after a doctor, Dr. Pendrin.</p>

<p>ADVERSE EFFECTS
The frequency of adverse reactions to the thioamides is up to ~15%. Common problems include fever and rashes.
Rare problems include cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, arthralgia.
Very rarely agranulocytosis can occur (0.3-0.6%). 
High dose regimens (usually of MMI) and advanced age may contribute to incidence of side effects.
	- Rare, but watch out for this.
PTU can lead to fulminant hepatitis and is usually reserved for use in early pregnancy.</p>

<p>ANTITHYROID ACTIVITY OF IODIDE.</p>

<p>That’s COUNTERINTUITIVE.
Called organification because you’re sticking Iodine to an organic moiety.
Iodide (I-) exerts antithyroidal effects. At pharmacological doses, iodide inhibits the organification reactions and release of the hormones from the thyroid.
High concentrations of iodide influence most aspects of iodine metabolism by the thyroid gland.
Iodide can limit its own transport. Acute inhibition of the synthesis of iodotyrosines and iodothyronines by iodide is well known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect.
Inhibition is observed only above threshold concentrations of intracellular, not extracellular, iodide.
	It only matters how much is in your parafollicular cells, not out.</p>

<p><strong>Responses to iodide can be variable.
Either hypo- OR hyperthyroidism can result.</strong></p>

<p>Iodide may be used together with thioamides. The thioamide is given first since initiation of iodide therapy can result in an increase in overall thyroid iodine (I2) levels and may initially promote hormone formation.
If co-administered, onset of thioamide activity is delayed
Iodide administration may obviate use of radioactive iodine therapy for several weeks.
	- If you take iodine, then you can’t use radioactive iodine scans for a while, because it won’t be taken up.</p>

<p>If iodide is used for greater than ~ 6-8 weeks, the thyroid can “escape” from the inhibitory effects of the ion.
Escape may be associated with an adaptive decrease in iodide transport and a lowered intracellular iodide concentration.
Escape can lead to severe thyrotoxicosis which may be life threatening.
As is the case for the other antithyroidal anions, iodide crosses the placenta.</p>

<p>“Iodism” may include fever, rash, mucous membrane ulcers, and, rarely, anaphylactoid reactions. Toxicity is uncommon.
The iodine content of some drugs, OTC preparations, antiseptics etc. may be substantial:
e.g.: Amiodarone
75 mg/tablet !!!!  0.15 mg/tablet
0.15 mg/tablet
Iodine-containing vitamins Kelp
You may also see contrast media used for their iodide content in thyroid storm. This is an “unlabeled” use.</p>

<p>RADIOACTIVE IODINE
Only 131I is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. It has a half-life of 8 days: &gt;99% is expended within 56 days. Radiation consists of  rays and  particles.
This is a generally safe approach
The other isotope, 123I, is a -emitter with a half-life of only 13 hours. This permits a relatively brief exposure to radiation during thyroid scans.</p>

<p>Adverse effects of 131I treatment
Usually a very safe and effective mode of therapy. Chief concern is the high incidence of delayed hypothyroidism. Even with an I2 uptake and gland size estimate, some patients will be overtreated. Titration to hypothyroidism and subsequent replacement is an acceptable approach.
There appears to be a rising prevalence of this complication with the passage of time. The longer the interval after treatment, the higher the incidence.
Thyroiditis is also a concern – (use glucocorticoids)</p>

<p>From this point on we will NOT be dealing with drugs currently used in hyperthyroidism
We WILL be dealing with some relevant Toxicology There are toxicological concerns associated with the
