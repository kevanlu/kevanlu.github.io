<blockquote>
  <h4 id="case-summary"><strong>Case Summary</strong></h4>
  <p>A 50-year old woman presents with a 6-month history of weight loss (40 lbs) despite a voracious appetite, severe palpitations, and uncontrollable shakiness. She feels very hot and sweaty and can’t get to sleep at night.</p>

  <p>Upon examination, the following is discovered. Her heart rate is 130/min and her blood pressure is 138/90. Her skin is warm, velvety and moist and there is a fine tremor of her hands. She has a noticeable stare and lid lag as well as chemosis and scleral injection. Her thyroid is diffusely enlarged and meaty with loud systolic and diastolic bruits over both lobes. There is a Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the aortic area.</p>

  <p>Laboratory investigations reveal the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>TSH &lt; 0.10 mU/L (0.3-4.5)</li>
    <li>Free T4 51 pmol/L (9-22)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>*Note: there’s a subtle difference between hyperthyroidism and </li>
  <li><strong>Hyperthryoidism</strong> → an overactive thyroid gland.</li>
  <li><strong>Thyrotoxicosis</strong> → high blood levels of thyroid hormone.</li>
  <li>So thyroiditis would be thyrotoxicosis, not hyperthyroidism, since the thyroid isn’t overactive, it’s just inflammed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="questions"><strong>Questions</strong></h4>
<ol>
  <li><em>What diagnosis is most consistent with the above history?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Hyperthyrodism</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Name 4 thyroid conditions that can cause an elevated FT4 and FT3.</em>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Graves’ Disease</em>.</li>
      <li><em>Toxic Adenoma</em> → one nodule in the thyroid.</li>
      <li><em>Toxic Multinodular Goiter</em> → multiple nodules in the thyroid.</li>
      <li><em>Thyroiditis</em> → inflammation of the thyroid gland, causing a release of thyroid hormones.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the most likely cause of her elevated FT4 and FT3? Justify your conclusions from the history, physical exam and lab tests.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Graves’ Disease</em>.</li>
      <li>Female, middle aged, consistent with Graves.</li>
      <li>Ocular symptoms → stare and lid lag.
        <ul>
          <li>Eye symptoms due to antibody attack of the extra-ocular muscles.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Diffuse, homogeneous enlargement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>a) What other test(s) would or could you order to confirm the diagnosis? b) What additional information would the(se) test(s) provide?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Radioactive Iodine Scan</em> → to differentiate between Graves’ (diffuse uptake) versus a toxic adenoma (focal uptake).</li>
      <li>Antibodies → specific for Graves’ disease. Usually not necessary, if history is suggestive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>List two mechanisms involved in producing her cardiovascular symptoms and signs.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased heart rate and contractility because of increased catecholamine sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Tremors also due to increased sympathetic activity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What treatment would you recommend to this lady? List the common side- effects of these treatments and consider any limitations in the quality of life of this patient because of their administration. Consider the variation in the administration of these drugs internationally. (United States, Europe, Japan, etc).</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Methimazole</strong> → first line treatment.</li>
      <li><em>Propylthiouracil</em> → second line, except in the first trimester of pregnancy.
        <ul>
          <li>Worried about Methimazole in the first trimester for teratogenic effects, so Propylthiouracil is used in the first trimester only, and then switched to Methimazole.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rare risk of <em>agranulocytosis</em> → a rare and dangerous side effect.</li>
      <li>Rare risk of <em>liver toxicity</em> → <i>higher with propylthiouracil</i>.</li>
      <li><em>Medication</em> is used most as 1<sup>st</sup> line treatment in Canada.</li>
      <li><em>Surgery</em> is used more in Europe.</li>
      <li><em>Radioactive Iodine Ablation</em> is used most in the US.
        <ul>
          <li>Not used in Japan → obvious stigma with radiation.</li>
          <li>Contraindicated in pregnancy.</li>
          <li>They usually also trigger radiation alarms in airports for a few months after treatment!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Could she have a diagnosis of Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis? Why or why not?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>No</em>. Even though you have a transient hyperthyroidism due to release of the thyroid hormone from destroyed cells, it wouldn’t have lasted <i>6 months</i>.</li>
      <li>She would have hypothyroidism by now if it was Hashimoto’s.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="case-2">Case #2</h1>
<hr />

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="case-summary-1"><strong>Case Summary</strong></h4>
  <p>A 26-year old female complains of palpitations that have been constant over the past two weeks but seem worse at night. She states that they are regular and it feels as if her heart is going to jump out of her chest. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. She recently delivered a normal baby boy during an uncomplicated delivery 5 1⁄2 weeks before this visit. She has been feeling a bit warm lately, and complains of feeling tired but being unable to get a good night sleep. Her review of systems was remarkable for loose stools occurring approximately 4 times/day. She feels that her mind is racing and denies heat or cold intolerance.</p>

  <p>Upon physical examination, her blood pressure was 146/90 and her pulse was 96. She showed a fine tremor of the hands. Her thyroid was approximately 1.5 times normal in size, symmetrically enlarged, firm, non-tender with carotids palpable bilaterally without bruits.</p>

  <p>Lab Investigations:
- FT4 16.2 (9-22)
- TSH &lt;0.05 (0.3 – 4.5)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="questions-1"><strong>Questions</strong></h4>
<ol>
  <li><em>What is the state of her thyroid function?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Subclinical Hyperthyroidism</em>.</li>
      <li>Why is her TSH still low, even though her Free T4 is normal?
        <ul>
          <li>There’s a lag time for the TSH to normalize, so maybe she only just recently had overt hyperthyroidism.</li>
          <li>Symptoms seem to agree with this.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the likeliest cause of the thyroid problem?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Post-partum thyroiditis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>She denies feeling depressed and you are not sure whether the clinical presentation warrants a more thorough investigation of her mental state. Should you investigate more thoroughly? Investigate the correlation between depression and your proposed diagnosis in this patient population.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Still no good evidence suggestive of a link between post-partum depression and post-partum thyroiditis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What other investigations should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>None</em> → post-partum thyroiditis is a clinical diagnosis.</li>
      <li>We can’t do a radioactive iodine scan, because it’s contraindicated in breast-feeding mothers.</li>
      <li>She also seems to be recovering already.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Describe and discuss the clinical and laboratory presentation of this disorder. Ensure that you understand the natural history of this disorder.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Post-partum thyroiditis usually gets better on its own.</li>
      <li>About a third of women will go hyperthyroid → euthyroid.</li>
      <li>Another third of women will go hyperthyroid → hypothyroid → euthyroid.</li>
      <li>A final third of women will go hypothyroid → euthyroid.</li>
      <li>However, a quarter to half of all of these will end up with chronic hypothyroidism after 10 years.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What would you do to treat this patient? Is treatment required?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow up with her until recovery.</li>
      <li>No treatment is required.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What does this mean for her future management?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal antibodies may develop after.
        <ul>
          <li>Recall that these were signs of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>So they may have hypothyroidism down the line.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="case-summary-2"><strong>Case Summary</strong></h4>
  <p>A 60-year-old lady presents with a 6-month history of weight gain (despite a poor appetite), cold intolerance, dry skin and hair, hoarseness of the voice and generalized puffiness. Lately she had developed retrosternal heaviness with minimal activity relieved by rest.</p>

  <p>On examination, her skin was cool and dry with generalized edema. Oral temperature is 36.3 ̊C. Heart rate is 52 BPM. Blood pressure is 140/90. The thyroid was diffusely enlarged and firm. There was dullness at the right lung base with decreased vocal and tactile fremitus. Heart sounds were barely audible. The relaxation phase of the reflexes was delayed and there was pseudomyotonia on striking the deltoids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pseudomyotonia -&gt; delayed relaxation of the muscles.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>What one test would you do to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism?</em>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TSH</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Describe and discuss the two major mechanisms involved in the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism, giving 3 examples of each that this lady had.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Slowing of the metabolic processes</em>:
        <ul>
          <li>Cold intolerance.</li>
          <li>Reduced heart rate.</li>
          <li>Weight gain.</li>

          <li>Hoarseness.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>a) How would you treat this woman’s hypothyroidism? b) *Describe why you would choose that particular treatment regimen?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Synthroid. orally.</li>
      <li>Start low, go up slowly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What would you do about the enlarged firm goitre?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Nothing, unless it’s a high risk nodule.</li>
      <li>If not responsive to treatment, do an ultrasound to look for nodules.</li>
      <li>Recall that you should avoid unnecessarily going for an ultrasound, because you have to follow them down the entire diagnostic chain, if you find an incidental nodule.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h1 id="case-4">Case #4</h1>
<hr />

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="case-summary-3"><strong>Case Summary</strong></h4>
  <p>A 68-year-old man is critically ill in the Intensive Care Unit. His thyroid function tests reveal the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>TSH: 1.0 mU/L (0.3-4.5).</li>
    <li>FT4: 8.0 mmol/L (9-22).</li>
    <li>FT3: 1.5 mmol/L (3.5-6.5).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You think that his thyroid indices can be explained by Non-Thyroidal Illness (NTI), since they are critically ill, with a normal TSH, but low FT4 and FT3.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="questions-2"><strong>Questions</strong></h4>
<ol>
  <li><em>Research and discuss the characteristics of NTI.</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>NTI</em> = <em>Non-thyroidal Illness</em>.</li>
      <li>The thyroid isn’t really dysfunctional, it’s just as a consequence of the patient’s critical illness.</li>
      <li><em>Two mechanisms:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>There’s an increased conversion to reverse T3 instead of FT3, resulting in lower FT3 levels.</li>
          <li>The pituitary is less responsive to low FT3 and FT4.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is Euthyroid Sick Syndrome? Explore this and NTI in terms of prevalence and what they mean for patients.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>They’re pretty much the same → they’re <i>synonyms</i>.</li>
      <li>Increased prevalence with severely ill patients.</li>
      <li>What happens when you get better? Your thyroid hormone levels go back to normal; if not, then there is an underlying issue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Discuss whether these responses are adaptive or maladaptive.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>The levels seen in NTI </li>
      <li>Still controversial → some people believe that a decreased metabolic rate is an adaptation to reduce bodily maintenance needs in patients that are critically ill.</li>
      <li>Other people believe that it’s maladaptive response.</li>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="case-summary-5"><strong>Case Summary</strong></h4>
  <p>A 35-year-old woman noticed a lump on the right side of her neck when she was brushing her teeth. She noticed it moved up and down when she swallowed and found that she experienced some difficulty swallowing solids and liquids. However, she has not experienced any change in her voice or other discomfort. She does note that the mass seems to have enlarged since the discovery. She has lost 20 lbs in weight over the past 6 months despite a good appetite. She has otherwise been well and denies any other symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism. There is no family history of thyroid disease.</p>

<h4 id="questions-4"><strong>Questions</strong></h4>
<ol>
  <li><em>Describe the four methods in which you could investigate this nodule.</em>
    <ol>
      <li><em>TSH</em> → if it’s a hot nodule (low TSH), then it’s less likely to be cancer than with a cold nodule.</li>
      <li><em>Ultrasound</em> → look for nodules, size.</li>
      <li><em>Radioactive Uptake Sign</em> → look for localization, whether it’s a hot/cold nodule.</li>
      <li><em>FNAB</em> → to get a diagnostic result (benign/malignant).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>You perform a Fine Needle Aspiration that is read as “indeterminate”. What does this mean to you and the patient?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>It means you didn’t get enough cells, or they’re too clumped together.</li>
      <li>You have to do the biopsy again.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>What is the sensitivity and specificity of these tests?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Both the sensitivity and specificity are pretty high.</li>
      <li>Unless it’s an indeterminate sample.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>How do pathologists arrive at the diagnosis of thyroid cancer?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>They do some magic voodoo stuff when they look at the cells.</li>
      <li><em>Papillary Thyroid Cancer</em> → big nuclei (often crowded with clefts and grooves).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>How would you manage this young woman’s condition?</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Repeat the FNAB again.</li>
      <li>Hemithyroidectomy, if it’s still an indeterminate lesion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>After your initial examination, your patient has researched her condition on the internet and now harbours numerous ‘internet fears’. How will you quell these fears? Anticipate your patient’s concerns and address these within your groups.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Worried about incision to neck, or anesthesia.</li>
      <li>If indeterminate, worried the surgery may be unncessary, since </li>
      <li>Find out what their needs are, what they’re worried about, blah blah blah.</li>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="case-summary-6"><strong>Case Summary</strong></h4>
  <p>A 47-year old woman you diagnosed with Graves’ opts for a total thyroidectomy due to her large thyroid size. 5 days post-op she is brought into hospital after having a seizure. Her family mentions that 2 days prior she had been complaining of “pins and needles” in her fingers and toes, and around her lips.</p>

  <p>Her laboratory findings are:
- TSH: 2.4 mU/L (0.3-4.5).
- Ca: 1.84 mmol/L (2.12-2.62).
- Albumin: 40 g/L (35-50).
- Na: 137 mmol/L (135-145).
- K: 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-4.5).
- Glucose: 4.8 (3.6-6.3).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything’s normal, except for her low calcium.</li>
  <li>What would you say about her calcium if her albumin.
    <ul>
      <li>Correct calcium by albumin level (since calcium binds to albumin in the body).</li>
      <li>Since her albumin is normal, this is true hypocalcemia.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="questions-5"><strong>Questions</strong></h4>
<ol>
  <li>She is now awake and alert after recovering from her seizure. What are two clinical signs can you examine for?</li>
</ol>

<p>Trusseau’s Sign.
Put it above the systolic (20-30), keep it there for 3 minutes, see if they have the carpal spasm.
Quite painful :(
Also known as the man duchuchau!?!?! (Hand of the Obstetrician).</p>

<p>ChuaSteks sign.
Facial nerve twitching
Eye twitches, blah?
15% of normal people can have it though, so not that specific.</p>

<p>Hyperreflexia
Increased deep tendon reflexes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>a) What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?</li>
</ol>

<p>Removed her parathyroid glands, resulting in hypoparathyroidism.
Small, may have missed ‘em</p>

<p>b) What other lab investigation(s) would confirm the etiology of her hypocalcemia?</p>

<p>Ca -&gt; would be low.
PTH -&gt; would be low.
Vitamin D -&gt; would be low.
Phosphate -&gt; would be high. (since PTH promotes phosphate excretion from kidney)
Need the PTH for the hydroxylation steps.</p>

<p>How do you DDx Vitamin D deficiency and Hypoparathyroidism.
Both have low calcium and vitamin D.
PTH shouldn’t be low in vitamin D deficiency, should be high to try and increase absorption.
ALSO DIFFERENCE IN PHOSPHATE.</p>

<p>Psuedohypoparathyroidism
PTH resistant.
Only difference is that PTH level is high.
Ca, Vitamin D, Phosphate otherwise the same.</p>

<p>MAKE A CHART.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How would you manage her acutely?</li>
</ol>

<p>SHORT TERM MANAGEMENT.
Give her calcium.
Calcium gluconate.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What do you tell her about her long-term management?</li>
</ol>

<p>LONG TERM MANAGEMENT.
Could be short term (stunning of parathyroid due to strain on blood supply), or could be permanent.
May need long term calcium and Vitamin D (to improve absorption) supplementation.
Recall Calcitriol is the biologically active form of Vitamin D.
Target serum calcium level is on the low side of normal, to try and stimulate them parathyroids in case they’re only transiently stunned.
Also, better to keep Ca low to prevent kidney stones.</p>

<p>Recombinant PTH used in osteoporosis
Why not hypoparathyroidism? Technically, it should work. If you don’t have PTH, why don’t you just give ‘em it?
	But it’s (a) EXPENSIVE, and (b) INJECTED.</p>

<p>Will need levothyroxine due to her total thyroidectomy.</p>
