Job is to maky thyroid hormone.  One key ingredient for this is iodine.  So it needs to get iodine into the colloid (thyroid follicle), where thyroglobulin exists, to make T3 and T4.  How do we get iodine across these follicular cells.  We use something called the iodine trap:          NIS → sodium iodine symporter, uses Na+ gradient to transport I- into the thyroid cell.      Pendrin transports I- into lumen for oxidative coupline to thyroglobulin.TPO – thyroid peroxidase (iodinates/couples thyroglobulin (Tg)         2 processes.  Iodin  Thyroglobulin T3-T4 mixure bought back into follicular cells by pinocytosis.  Then breaks apart thyroglobulin (by MIT and DIT), releasing T3, T4 into the blood.  IODINE TRAP = symporters which bring into site of T3/T4 backyard.  Colloid is another name for backyard,   330 tyrosine residues from which we can make T3 and T4.Colloid - reservoir of materials for thyroid hormone production including Tg (thyroglobulin)Two hormones are released from Iodinated Tg by intracellular enzymes:pinocytosis1. Triiodothryonine (T3) 2. 2. Thyroxine (T4)This is how it’s made, how is it enhanced? BY TSH.Binding to receptor upregulates NIS to bring more iodine into the cell.Also increases transglobulin production? More material to work with.Increases TPO activity, main enzyme responsible for conjugating Tg to Iodine.FUNCTION OF THYROID PEROXIDASEIodinate it once -&gt; Monoiodotyrosine.Iodinate it twice -&gt; Diiodotyrosine.Coupling Mono + Di can get Triiodothyronine (T3)Or take 2 Diiodotyprosine (T4)THYROID HORMONE CARRIER PROTEINSNot water loving, lipid soluble.So need a carrier protein.1. MAJOR ONE IS THYROXING BINDING GLOBULIN (TBG)Binds to 75% of circulating T3/T4.      TransThyretin (TTR)        Human Serum Albumin (HSA)  WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN T3 and T4.T3 is about 10x more potent than T4.The problem is that the half life of T3 is much shorter.T4 = stable, less potent.T3 functions as the active form of thyroid hormone, which is converted form the longer lasting, less effective, T4.T3 is the active form of thyroid hormoneConversion of T4→T3 carried out by cell specific deiodinases (D1-D4)WRONG- FIX THIS, SEE LATER DIAGRAM ON COOK’S PART.Too much T4, T4 -&gt; T3.Too much T3, T3 -&gt; reverse T3.or -&gt; T2, less effective.TR is a nuclear receptor, but more like a transcription factor that turns on/off specific genes.Role of Thyroid HormonesROLE OF THYROID HORMONESEarly Growth and Development•Required for GH secretion and action•Essential for early neural development (via induction of NGF) •Maternal lack of T3/T4growth retardation and cretinismMetabolic ActivityIncreases mitochondrial growth, replication and activity; basal metabolic activityIncreased heat production, O2 demand, HR and SVStimulates Na+/K+-ATPase activity Increased metabolic demand (e.g. glucose)Increases transcription of energy metabolism enzymes Increased lipolysis, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis leads to increasedblood metabolite levels and cellular uptakeT3/T4 is permissive to GH action and necessary for induction of PRL, GH, surfactant and NGF expressionLESS FAT&lt; LESS GLYCOGEN, MORE GLUCOSE = more accessible ATP.NGF = neural growth factor expression.ENDEMIC DEFICIENCIES OF THYROID HORMONES (T3, T4)Because of a dietary deficiency in iodine.We used to have that, but now we fortified our salts with iodine, which resolved that issue.ENDEMIC GOITER -&gt; enlargement of thyroid gland.Occurs because we don’t make normal T3/T4, so we have high levels of TSH, and there’s no negative feedback on the high level of TSH.TSH results in hypertrophy of cells in the thyroid gland.Leading to this goiter.Tx by reintroduction of iodine, or IV T3/T4.HypothyroidismWHAT CAN GO WRONG.Lack of energySlow heart rate..Muscle crampingLack of concentration, poor memoryPuffy eyelids.Feeling odd.HASHIMOTOs DISEASE- Antobodies against TPO, thyroid peroxidase.- Recall that TPO was what iodinated thyroglobulin.- As a result, we have less T3/T4.•Case 8 yr old, 3’6”, immature body phenotype•1 yr later, 4’, body phenotype normalLots of fat deposition due to low basal metabolic rate.TOOK A YEAR - SINCE THEY’RE SLOW ACTING, SO TREATMENT TAKES TIME.HyperthyroidismAnti-TSH receptor antibodies—activating- Feeling hot, icnreased sweating.- Fast, strong, or irregular heart beat.- Nervousness, trembling hands.GRAVE’S DISEASE.Anti-TSH receptor antibodies bind to the receptorLeaves them ‘constitutively’ active → unbounded T3/T4 production.• hand tremor• insomnia• hyperactivity• protrusion of the eye • mood swings• dizzynessCALCITONIN.Third, less known, thyroid hormone.Important in fish, but to man?SMall amino acid peptide.Inhibits osteoclast acitivty in the long term.Produced in the thyroid!?

(rats)No mention in Endotext.org, Thyroidmanager.org, MedlinePlus, etc.Except………in reference to medullary carcinoma!Thyroid PharmacologyRecall, 2 forms of T3, one highly active.The other one is inactive.Why the difference?Can have different binding locations of 3 iodines on the aromatic rings.3,5,3’-tri-iodothyronine (T3) is a highly active thyroid hormone3,3’,5’-tri-iodothyronine, (reverse T3 or rT3), is inactive.Recall that iodine is a big atom. Ether oxygen has a bent shape.So the 2 rings aren’t coplanar, they’re bent.Because the two iodines into the bend, so big, causes them to twist.That’s why the reverse T3 doesn’t quite fit the receptor, INACTIVE!Notice the opportunities for stereoisomerism.L and D series.All active are L series hormones.There is a D series thyroxine, which will be talked about soon.* [D-thyroxine has lipid lowering properties]See the *!Recall that most T3 is produced in peripheral tissue, converted from T4.Conversion (activation) occurs with 5’ deiodination of the outer ring of T4  T3 which becomes the biologically active hormone responsible for the majority of thyroid hormone effectsT4 may be considered a prohormone for T3Conversion of T4 to T3 occurs in the liver (1), at kidney, and at other peripheral sites.Conversion is stereoselective and involves a family of selenodeiodinases. Note the production of rT3	Deiodinases, that require selenium within the structure of the enzyme to be active.	So selenium is the prosthetic group here.	In extremely rare instances of selenium deficiency, we have impaired conversion of T4 to T3.D1 and D3 are deiodinases. Different isoforms.T3 is the main contributor to biological activity.Inactivating D3 not only converts T4 to ianctive T3, but also T3 to inactive T2.SO D3 is a INACTIVATOR!TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROIDISMReplacement therapy is indicated in hypothyroidism.	- It’s so GOOD that one of the treatments for hyperthyroidism is to remove the thyroid, and replace it with external thyroid hormone.Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis)Impaired hormone synthesisDestruction of thyroid tissue (e.g. irradiation, surgery) Secondary to pituitary/hypothalamic disease (i.e. TSH deficit)Congenital (cretinism)Following consumption of antithyroid drugs or foodsThe preparations available are either extracts of animal source thyroid tissue or are synthetic drugs. The latter are by far the most common.Synthetic T4 (Levothyroxine, Synthroid®) is available in both tablet and parenteral formulations.Synthetic T3 (Liothyronine, Cytomel®) is also available in both formulations.Thyroid dessicated USP is an extract of bovine thyroid tissue. It is available in oral formulations	Dessicated thyroid tissue is also available, source of a controversial opinion, will be mentioned in a moment (available on internet).There are a wide range of tablet dosages available. Usual adult dose is ~100 g/d. (Kids: 100 g/m2/d) -&gt; adjusted by body surface area, since they’re smaller.The synthetic drugs are manufactured to contain microgram (g) quantities of the hormones.Thyroid extract on the other hand, contains milligram (mg) quantities of active material.That’s a THOUSAND FOLD DIFFERENCE. So most of this actually isn’t thyroid hormone, it’s just other shit.The extra shit is sources are bovine or porcine and the difference indicates the presence of considerable amounts of other material which may contribute to allergyWoman has a website -&gt; STOP THE THYROID MADNESS. WOman has been advocating for almost a decade to take the dessicated thyroid tissue. Ahahahaa.Thyroxine T4 (levothyroxine sodium) is the hormone of choice for replacement therapy because of its consistent potency and prolonged duration of action.Absorption of thyroxine occurs in the small intestine and is variable and incomplete, with 50% to 80% of the dose absorbed. Absorption is increased when the hormone is taken on an empty stomach.	Patients are counseled to take tablet in the morning, on an empty stomach.Certain drugs may interfere with absorption of levothyroxine in the gut, including sucralfate, cholestyramine resin, iron supplements, calcium supplements and aluminum hydroxide.	Calcium in dairy products can also affect absorption. So don’t take it after they’ve drunk milk.Triiodothyronine T3 (liothyronine sodium) is used occasionally when a faster onset of action is desired e.g. in the rare presentation of myxedema comaMOST OF THE ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE EXTENSION EFFECTS -&gt; Basically what they’d do normally, except in excess.The adverse effects of the thyroid hormones are mostly extension effects. Allergy (natural products),Check the consequences of thyroid hypersecretion or overdosage to see the range of potential problems .The principal problems involve the cardiovascular system. Elevated levels of thyroid hormones give rise toa syndrome resembling sympathetic hyperactivity	This is what you should worry about.	Mimic of sympathetic hyperactivity.The activity of several other drugs is altered when thyroid hormones are given. This is usually because of the metabolic changes brought about by hormone activity  BMROther interactions occur following increases or decreases in plasma protein binding and following inhibition of 5’D-I	- Any compound that is circulating bound to a plasma protein, is subject to competition by other molecules.	- If the concentration of the other molecule is too high, they’ll be outcompeted, weill be free.	- Or inhibition of de-iodinases. (look at this later).Treatment of HyperthyroidismHyperthyroid conditions often require treatment with drugs which diminish the synthesis and/or release of the active thyroid hormones.The processes involved in synthesis of the thyroid hormones can be modified by several different moieties including a specific group of drugs, the iodide ion, and certain other anions.In addition to therapeutic use, some toxicological concerns arise.A group known as the thioamides possess antithyroid properties. They are used in several hyperthyroid conditions such as Graves’ disease, Thyrotoxicosis, and Toxic Nodular Goitres.The Thioamides inhibit:The incorporation of iodide into tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin.The coupling of MIT and DIT to form T3 and T4Inhibition of these reactions leads to inhibition of hormone synthesis and to depletion of active hormone from the thyroid gland.This process takes some time because of the need to deplete preformed and stored hormone.After initial Dx, Pt usually put on MMI (Methimazole), but takes weeks to months before beings to take an effect!Methimazole (MMI) is approximately an order of magnitude more potent than PTU.Propylthiouracil (PTU) has a diminished ability to cross the placenta relative to that of MMI.	- Better for pregnancy.However, onset is faster. Why?	- D1 deiodinase can be inhibited by PTU!	- So it has a second effect of inhibiting T4-T3 conversionPendrin! Named after a doctor, Dr. Pendrin.ADVERSE EFFECTSThe frequency of adverse reactions to the thioamides is up to ~15%. Common problems include fever and rashes.Rare problems include cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, arthralgia.Very rarely agranulocytosis can occur (0.3-0.6%). High dose regimens (usually of MMI) and advanced age may contribute to incidence of side effects.	- Rare, but watch out for this.PTU can lead to fulminant hepatitis and is usually reserved for use in early pregnancy.ANTITHYROID ACTIVITY OF IODIDE.That’s COUNTERINTUITIVE.Called organification because you’re sticking Iodine to an organic moiety.Iodide (I-) exerts antithyroidal effects. At pharmacological doses, iodide inhibits the organification reactions and release of the hormones from the thyroid.High concentrations of iodide influence most aspects of iodine metabolism by the thyroid gland.Iodide can limit its own transport. Acute inhibition of the synthesis of iodotyrosines and iodothyronines by iodide is well known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect.Inhibition is observed only above threshold concentrations of intracellular, not extracellular, iodide.	It only matters how much is in your parafollicular cells, not out.Responses to iodide can be variable.Either hypo- OR hyperthyroidism can result.Iodide may be used together with thioamides. The thioamide is given first since initiation of iodide therapy can result in an increase in overall thyroid iodine (I2) levels and may initially promote hormone formation.If co-administered, onset of thioamide activity is delayedIodide administration may obviate use of radioactive iodine therapy for several weeks.	- If you take iodine, then you can’t use radioactive iodine scans for a while, because it won’t be taken up.If iodide is used for greater than ~ 6-8 weeks, the thyroid can “escape” from the inhibitory effects of the ion.Escape may be associated with an adaptive decrease in iodide transport and a lowered intracellular iodide concentration.Escape can lead to severe thyrotoxicosis which may be life threatening.As is the case for the other antithyroidal anions, iodide crosses the placenta.“Iodism” may include fever, rash, mucous membrane ulcers, and, rarely, anaphylactoid reactions. Toxicity is uncommon.The iodine content of some drugs, OTC preparations, antiseptics etc. may be substantial:e.g.: Amiodarone75 mg/tablet !!!!  0.15 mg/tablet0.15 mg/tabletIodine-containing vitamins KelpYou may also see contrast media used for their iodide content in thyroid storm. This is an “unlabeled” use.RADIOACTIVE IODINEOnly 131I is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. It has a half-life of 8 days: &gt;99% is expended within 56 days. Radiation consists of  rays and  particles.This is a generally safe approachThe other isotope, 123I, is a -emitter with a half-life of only 13 hours. This permits a relatively brief exposure to radiation during thyroid scans.Adverse effects of 131I treatmentUsually a very safe and effective mode of therapy. Chief concern is the high incidence of delayed hypothyroidism. Even with an I2 uptake and gland size estimate, some patients will be overtreated. Titration to hypothyroidism and subsequent replacement is an acceptable approach.There appears to be a rising prevalence of this complication with the passage of time. The longer the interval after treatment, the higher the incidence.Thyroiditis is also a concern – (use glucocorticoids)From this point on we will NOT be dealing with drugs currently used in hyperthyroidismWe WILL be dealing with some relevant Toxicology There are toxicological concerns associated with theantithyroidal effects of several ions.Some ions are used in industrial processes and exposure of industrial workers may be a problem.Thyroid Toxicology", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/endocrinology/2014/09/02/thyroid-physiology-pharmacology.html"},

Define the terms circadian, diurnal and ultradian and explain the generation and importance of episodic endocrine secretion.  Outline the 5 hypothalamic-anterior pituitary axes and 2 posterior pituitary axes.Some DefinitionsNeural: functions are mediated by electro-chemical conduction along nerves.Endocrine: functions are mediated by chemical messengers.ENDOCRINE: chemical mediators produced in one part of the body which act on a distant part.

Hormone A stimulates Organ B.          Organ B produces Hormone B.          Hormone B inhibits Organ A.          Eg. TSH and T3.

Eg. insulin, glucoase, and glucagon.                      Positive Feedback:          Positive Feed Forward → ie. estrogen on LH and FSH.      Epidosidic Endocrine Secretion  Hormone secretion often follows rhythms.  Circadian/Diurnal:          Diurnal → exactly 24 hours       Circadian and Diurnal are often used interchangeably.      eg. GHRH, CRH, cortisol        Ultradian → minutes or hours (eg. GnRH, LH).  These patterns of secretion can vary → for instance, by gender.Factors Affecting Hormone Action  Hormone production/release: a. Regulation of gene expression by other hormones and cytokines. b. Availability of necessary substrates, enzymes and energy. c. Innervation.  Plasma Hormone Dynamics: a. Carrier proteins → eg. SHBG, CBG, IGFBP3.     - Some hormones need a ‘delivery system’ (steroid hormones, amino acid derivatives), which introduced another point of failure.     - Carrier proteins affect hormone solubility, stability, metabolic clearance, and bioavailability. b. Converting/deactivating enzymes:     - Eg. ACE, ECE, COMT. c. Metabolic clearance:     - An overactive kidney or liver may increase clearance of hormones, for instance.  Receptors and Signal Transduction:          You can have a problem on the delivery end, but also on the receiving end.      This is seen with Type 2 Diabetes, where the insulin receptor becomes less sensitive to insulin.      Hormone Receptors####Plasma Membrane ReceptorsCytosolic/Nuclear Receptors  These hormones are carried to the cell by a binding protein.  But once they get to the cell, they can easily get through the lipid membrane.  That’s and intuitive explanation for why these receptors aren’t on the cell membrane surface, but may actually lie in the cytosol or nuclear!  These receptors themselves act as transcription factors to turn on or off certain genes.  A single hormone may elicit different responses in each target tissue.  For instance, some tissues have a 5α-reductase enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT, a more potent form of testosterone.  Also, different cells have different receptors and downstream cascades, resulting in different effects.Less Famous Endocrine Organs  The gut secretes its own series of hormones to regulate food intake and digestion (CCK, ghrelin, gastrin, secretin, NPY….).  The heart secretes ANP, an important factor in regulating vascular tone and volume.  The kidneys secrete EPO which increases erythrocyte formation.  The liver secretes angiotensinogen (angiotensin precursor), IGF-I and thrombopoietin (↑ platelets).  Fat produces many “adipokines” (e.g. leptin, adiponectin).  Key point → most cells produce locally-acting growth factors and cytokines.NeuroendocrinologyThe hypothalamus has neurons that have hormon secretory cells at the end.Protrude from the hypothalamus to the hypophyseal portal system.Then acts on the anterior pituitary.PARVICELLULAR NEURONS.

Describe a hypothalamic-pituitary-end organ feedback loop.  Complete a grid of pituitary hormones and the effect of overproduction and underproduction of these hormones.The Endocrine System  The pituitary gland is basically the master regulator of a number of endocrine organs.          However, the pituitary gland itself is regulated by the hypothalamus.      There are negative feedback loops that keep hormone release under control.        There are a lot of interactions → things can get confusing.  Try to simplify things to the following:          What does the hormone do?      What happens when a hormone is under-produced?      What happens when a tumour is over-produced?      Modules  Thyroid Gland.          Hypothalamus released TRH → Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone.      TRH stimulates the Pituitary gland to produce TSH → Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.      This stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4 hormones.        Parathyroid Glands          Release of Parathyroid hormone in response to Calcium levels.      This actually isn’t regulated centrally by the hypothalamus, feedback it managed locally by the parathyroid glands themselves.        Adrenal Glands          CRH is released by the Hypothalamus.      This stimulates ACTH release by the Pituitary Gland.      ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, mineralicorticoids, glucocorticoids, etc.        Pituitary Gland, Growth &amp; Growth Hormone, Sexual Development &amp; Puberty          The reproduction component is left until the Reproduction block.

	{"title": "Clinical Presentation &amp; Evaluation of Thyroid Disease", "text": "Lecture Objectives  At the end of this session, a prospective generalist physician should be able to:          Describe a framework for thyroid disorders – how do patients present?      Describe the mechanisms and common diseases resulting in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.        Explain the role for each of the following diagnostic tests for thyroid disorders:          TSH, free T3, free T4.      Radioactive iodine uptake &amp; scan.      Thyroid ultrasound.      Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy.        Describe the clinical and histological features, and pathogenesis of:          Graves’ disease.      Hashimoto thyroiditis.       Multinodular goitre.      Each of the following thyroid neoplasms:                  Follicular adenoma.          Papillary, follicular, anaplastic, medullary carcinomas.                    A Framework for Thyroid Disorders  For a review of material from last year, see The Thyroid.  What are benign disorders of thyroid structure?  What clinical consequences could result? Consider the location of the thyroid and proximal structures.          Hoarseness → close proximity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.      Stridor → compression of the trachea.      Dysphagia → compression of the esophagus.      Swelling of the neck.      How do Patients Present?  You have symptoms:          Related to Structure.      Related to Function.        Many patients actually present incidentally, because they’re picked up on imaging for something completely different (eg. due to a carotid ultrasound, or a head CT).Assessing Function  Thyroid function can be assessed with:          Serum TSH → look at pituitary stimulation.      Serum Free T3/ Free T4 → free thyroid hormone is measured so the effects of binding proteins are ignored.        With Thyrotoxicosis (~Hyperthyroid), you have less TSH (because the pituitary doesn’t stimulate the thyroid since it’s already active), and the free T3/T4 are elevated.  With a Primary Hypothyroid problem, you have more TSH (the pituitary gland tries to stimulate the thyroid), and free T3/T4 fall.  The TSH is the most sensitive test of thyroid function.          It can detect subclinical hyperthyroidism/hypothyroidism, where the TSH has fallen/risen respectively, but the FT3/FT4 hasn’t changed yet.        Finally, there are central causes of hypo/hyperthroidism:          Here, the TSH doesn’t change, or changes in the wrong direction, in response to T3/T4 levels.        Summary Diagrams  ThyrotoxicosisAssessing Symptoms  Thyrotoxicosis:          Heat intolerance.      Increased sweating.      Tremor.      Palpitations.      Hyperactivity.      Insomnia.      Emotional lability/Anxiety.      Weight loss despite increased appetite.      Increased GI motility/Hyperdefecation.Signs• Tremor• Soft, warm, skin• Increased heart rate• Increased cardiac outputThyrotoxicosis and Graves’ Eye Symptoms• Stare (decreased blink)• Lid retraction → The eyelid will be retracted, so you can see the top of the sclera.• Lid lag → iris and pupil will move faster than the eyelid.Graves-specific Eye Symptoms•Proptosis → eyes actually pushed forward.•Periorbital edema •Diplopia → double vision, here often with an upward gaze.•Visual loss → emergency, requires urgent optho referral.        Immune mediated (antibody) stimulation of the TSH receptor– Graves’ Disease – most common   Autonomous thyroid tissue– Toxic multinodular goitre – Toxic adenomaGraves DiseasePathophysiology- Autoimmune: stimulation of TSH receptor by antibody (thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin).	- Constitutive stimulation results in hyperplasia and hypertrophy.- Most common cause of hyperthyroidism.- Women &gt; Men.- 30-50 yrs &gt; Young/old.- Systemic, ocular and skin manifestations.- Diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland.- Diffuse follicular hyperplasia.Pathological Findings with Graves’ Disease•Graves•Hyperplastic follicle cells form small, simple, papillary projections into lumen•Colloid scalloping prominent •Normal•Evenly spaced follicle cells form oval/round folliclesClinical Findings of Graves’ Diseaseincreased volume of the retro-orbital connective tissues and extraocular muscles secondary to inflammation, edema, accumulation of extracellular glycosaminoglycans, and increased adipocytes.Induce thyroblasts to produce mucoid like material. These then mature into fat cells (depending on what genes they turn on). So inflammation, edema, + glycosamines + glycans, resulting in exophthalmos.Proptosis vs exophthalmosExophthalmos also describes forward protrusion of the globe. Several authors use the terms differently, which is confusing:proptosis and exophthalmos used interchangeablyexophthalmos used to refer to severe (over 18 mm) proptosis 5exophthalmos used to refer to endocrine-related proptosis 6Diagnosis of Graves’ Disease  History -&gt; Dx Thyrotoxicosis first!  Graves = thyrotoxicosis due to TSH receptor activation by auto-immune Abs.  P/E -&gt; Can help confirm Graves’ Disease with bulging of the eyes.  But if you don’t see it, you can still have Graves’, because most patients with Graves’ won’t present with orbitopathies.  The best test to order initially is the TSH.          If it’s normal, then you really need to have a high pre-test probability to continue investigations.        If it’s low, then the next thing you would order is their free T4 and free T3.  Can actually measure TBII (Thyotropin Binding Inhibitory Immunoglobulin) → aka. TSH receptor antibodies.  Radioactive Iodine Uptake and Scan.          Recall that this can be used to differentiate between diffuse hyperactivity, characteristic of Graves’ disease, and localized hyperactivity, characteristic of a hot nodule.      EXAMPLE OF GRAVES DISEASE- Clearly, everything lights up, characteristic of diffuse hyperactivity.Treatment of Graves Disease3 basic approaches:  Drugs:          Methimazole, propylthiouracil.      Same method of action, interfere with production of thyroid hormone in the thyroid itself.      Methimazole is the first choice, because propylthiouracil has higher risk (recall fulm. hepatitis? But can be used in preg).      Rash, metallic taste, hypothyoridism, relapse, dose changes, teratogeniticity.      Agranulocytosis (rare), liver toxicity, drug induced vasculitis/SLE.        Radioactive Iodine Therapy:          Try to make the patient hypothyroid, so you can use safer, more predictable drugs such as throxine or cytomel.      Permanent hypothyroidism (timing? – must monitor TSH).      Contraindicated in pregnancy → you don’t want to burn out the baby’s thyroid gland and cause congenital hypothyroidism → cretinism.      Exacerbation of Graves’ ophthalmopathy (especially with smokers).                  Graves more common with smokers, and associated ophthalmopathy also more common.                      Surgical Thyroidectomy:          Permanent hypothyroidism      Surgical risks → hypoparathyroidism, laryngeal nerve injury      Thyroiditis• Thyrotoxicosis can also result from increased release of preformed thyroid hormone.• Thyroiditis = inflammation resulting in damage to the thyroid gland.- Most commonly because of a viral infection.- Often associated with a previous infection.EXAMPLE ABOVE. TBII negative. Thyroid scan shows diffuse radioactive iodine distribution due to thyroid damage.So uptake was basically zero with the radioactive iodine scan.2 months later, thyroid recovered. Rebounded a bit, actually hypothyroid a bit.• Viral/post-viral = painful = de Quervain’s.	- Viral/post-viral is probably the term used most now.• Auto-immune	• “painless,” “silent” “Hashitoxicosis” 	• Post‐partum (Hashimoto’s variant) -&gt; flare up after pregnancy, which suppresses immune system.• Drug-induced• Radiation-induced • Traumatic	- Maybe from a ridiculously craptastically vigorous thyroid exam.• Symptomatic Thyrotoxicosis - Nothing really except to wait for the thyroid to recover.- Make sure your diagnosis is correct.- Treat symptomatically.	• Beta blockers eg for heart rate.• Monitor for resolution and for hypothyroidism  Case Presentation      FT is a 39 year old woman who developed neck tenderness, odynophagia and ear pain 3 weeks ago.    The pain developed quickly worsened in the first week and is gradually resolving.    Over the last 3 weeks she has felt fatigued, warm and experienced palpitations.    She has lost 4 Kg over the last 3 weeks despite an increased appetite and has been unable to sleep or concentrate.    Case Presentation      JD is a 71 year old man who presented to the ER 2 months ago with symptoms suggestive of TIA (Transcient Ischemic Attack).    Carotid ultrasound shows no carotid plaques but thyroid nodules.    Thyroid ultrasound showed two solid nodules in the right lobe measuring 3 cm each.    On the left side there were also 2 complex nodules, 2 and 2.5 cm respectively.
