	{"title": "Adrenal Focal Cases", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary  A 31-year-old woman was referred for treatment of hypertension, first noticed during her last pregnancy two years ago. The hypertension had become progressively worse and required increasing amounts of Propranolol and diuretics. During the work-up for hypertension it was found that she also had glucose intolerance. Initial investigations for the hypertension (done while she was off anti-hypertensive therapy) revealed slightly low potassium levels and elevated blood sugars but no other abnormality.  On physical examination the patient was obese and had pre-auricular fat pads. The supraclavicular triangle was found to be bulging. She had chemosis and thin skin over the dorsum of her hands. There was minimal proximal muscle weakness in the legs. She had mild hirsutism and acne but no striae.  Give at least 2 examples of the effects of each type of hormone involved, and outline the pathophysiology of the symptoms and signs in this lady.          Cortisol excess → chemosis, thin skin.      Fat padding over the supraclavicular triangle (key to differentiating Cushing’s from obesity).                  High androgens → hirsutism and acne.          High mineralicorticoids, aldosterone, Na+ retention (hypertensive effect) and hyperkalemia.                      a) What initial test(s) would be most efficient in this situation? b) List 4 causes of a false positive screening test.          Suppression Dexamethasone.      24-hour free cortisol.      Saliva cortisol → standardize at 11 PM.      Serum free cortisol → standardize at 8 AM.                  False positives:          Birth control pills → estrogen excess.          Serum cortisol measures total (bound).          Estrogen increases binding, so free may even be lower.          Depression, alcoholism, obesity.          Obesity due to estrogen release with adipose tissue.          High stress situation, since it can trigger cortisol release.          Serum cortisol measures total bound cortisol (to cortisol binding globulin).          Saliva cortisol measures free cortisol, so it measures active cortisol.          Outpatient → rationale is that labs aren’t open at 11PM.                      How would you confirm the diagnosis?          2 day dexamethasone suppression.      Or B2B urinary is also a possible confirmatory test.      Case #2  A 42-year-old presents with weight gain of 20 pounds in the past year despite a decrease in her diet. Her husband tells her she doesn’t eat enough for a bird. She has been walking 30 minutes every day. She has otherwise been well. There is no significant family history.  On examination she was 88 kg with a height of 154 cm.  Pituitary vs Adrenal Cushing’s.  Pituitary will only increase Cortisol.  Adrenal will increase everything.  Differentiate Cushing’s Disease from Cushing’s Syndrome.  What other questions could you ask on history?          Cold intolerance, fatigue, hypothyroidism.      Quantify their diet → how many meals do you eat? What do you eat? All patients will tell you they don’t eat much, but when you actually get at their dietary history, it’s a whole different story.      Medications → steroids, tricyclic antidepressants, OCP, hormone replacement therapy.      R/o pregnancy → always in a female.      DDx:                  Hypothyroidism.          Medications.          Lifestyle.          Cushing’s → changes in skin, striae, fat padding, muscle weakness.          Acromegaly → change in clothing size, dentition, dental imprints in buccal mucosa, pictures of old driver’s license. See frontal bossing, prominent jaw, more acne, oily skin.                      What other areas of the physical examination would you be sure to inspect?          Physical signs of everything we’ve mentioned.      Look at thyroid → goiter.      Vitals → hypertension, bradycardia/tachycardia.      ‘Hung-up reflex’ → delayed relaxation phase of the reflex.      Sign of glucose intolerance (Cushings, acromegaly) on P/E? Acanthosis nigricans, axillary, back of neck, waist folds.        List screening lab tests would you considering ordering and a reason for each.          High cortisol? (Recall cortisol isn’t the best test) 24 hour urine.                  Because serum cortisol is variable over the day, esp. in response to stress.                    GH levels? Measure IGF-1.      Hypothyroidism? Measure TSH.      Serum glucose, glucose tolerance test!?                  Metabolic syndrome.          Triglycerides, abdo weight diameter, hypertension.                    Electrolytes                  See high Na+, low K+. More likely to see low K+ unless they’re floridly Cushing’s.          Opposite with adrenal insufficiency -&gt; WILL ALMOST ALWAYS SEE WEIGHT LOSS.                    If all negative, probably wrong with diet Hx, so do a food log.      Case #3  Case Summary  A 41-year-old man is discovered to be hypertensive on a routine physical examination. He had been complaining of some muscle weakness but was otherwise asymptomatic. Physical examination was normal apart from his blood pressure (160/105). BP was repeated on several occasions and always measured above 150/95.  Laboratory examination reveals:- Serum	 - Na 138 mmol/L (135-145).	 - K 2.3 mmol/L (3.5-4.5).	 - Cl 98 mmol/L (95-106).	 - HCO3 32 mmol/L (24-31).  What is your differential diagnosis for hypertension?          Essential hypertension.      Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s).      Renal artery stenosis (rare). With ACEI, will be profoundly hypokalemic (think about mechanism).      Cushing’s.      Black licorice. Ha.        What initial screening test would be most efficient in this situation?          Aldosterone:renin ratio.        Assuming the screening test is positive what further tests would you order to confirm the diagnosis?          If that’s positive, next test is urine aldosterone, look at response after a salt load (Saline infusion test).      Or empiric Tx with Spironolactone.      CT adrenals to r/o adrenal hyperplasia.                  Plasma/urine + salt loading.          Spironolactone empiric Tx are the 2 main options. If doesn’t fix, then primary hyperaldosteronism or essential hypertension (most common).                    Case #4  Case Summary  A 28-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of palpitations, shakiness, and sweating. These symptoms occur episodically starting suddenly and ending in a few minutes to an hour or so. They seem to be occurring more frequently.  List 5 other questions that will be helpful in determining the cause for these symptoms and indicate how each would be helpful.          Does it happen with caffeine?      Hx of heart problems?      Thyrotoxicosis? Less likely to be episodic.      Hypoglycemic.      Associated with anxiety? R/o anxiety attacks.      Symptoms of diabetes? frequent urination?      High chronic blood sugars. But diabetes are just as likely to be hypoglycemic unless they’re on Tx.      Or insulinoma!?      Cocaine, fluoroquinolones, beta-blockers can make you hypoglycemic.        How would you determine whether a pheochromocytoma is causing his symptoms?          Catecholamines in blood.      Look for the classic triad, orthostatic blood pressure.      Case #5  Case Summary  Mary Brown, a 21-year-old law student, is very concerned because she has to shave her chin and upper lip on a daily basis and cannot wear a bikini without shaving her abdomen. The hair growth started when she was 14 years old and has gradually become worse. Her periods started at the age of 12 and have always been very irregular. She has never been on birth control pills. Her father is quite hairy and one of his sisters has facial hair.  On examination she has significant terminal hair growth on her chin, upper lip, and in front of her ears. She has a male-pattern of hair growth on her abdomen with hair extending above the umbilicus. There is no clitoral hypertrophy and no other signs of virilization.  What are the 2 mostly likely diagnoses? Give justifications.          PCOS! Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She’s classic for this, especially if she’s having trouble getting pregnant.      Late onset CAH. Can get it at the onset of puberty.        List 5 blood tests you would order.  Imaging US  Physical exam: overweight, acne, hirsutism.  Measure LH, FSH levels.  Measure testosterone.  Serum 17 hydroxyprogesterone steroid.  DHEAS, precursor to BLEH hormones.  2 more hormones that can present with this picture, but less common. Always want to do this with irregular periods.          Prolactin → Prolactinoma.      TSH (hypothyroid) can affect periods too.        Definitely do β-HCG ahahaha!  What are 4 therapies you could offer Mary?          Oral contraceptives.      Spironolactone (long term commitment, minimum 6 months before results).      Mechanical -&gt; shaving, laser Tx (mainstay actually).      Case #6  Case Summary  A 37-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with severe weakness. Over the past year she noted increased pigmentation and freckling of the face, back, hands, elbows, and knees. She had a 15 pound weight loss, extreme weakness, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Upon standing she had lightheadedness. She has a past history of goitre and had complaints of cold intolerance, dry skin, somnolence, and constipation. There is no family history of endocrine disorders.Examination revealed a thin, pigmented, chronically ill woman. Blood pressure was 100/60 supine, and 0/0 standing. The pulse went from 84 to 120 on standing. Increased freckling and vitiligo were apparent around the eyes. No mucosal pigmentations were noted. The thyroid was slightly enlarged and firm. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. She had dark pigmentation of the nipples. There was no axillary or pubic hair. Neurological examination was normal except for generalized muscle weakness. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical with normal relaxation phase. The rest of the exam was normal.SerumNa 125 mmol/L K 6.7 mmol/L Cl 90 mmol/L HCO3 24.8 mmol/L Glucose 2.0 mmol/L Creat 110 umol/L Urea 7 mmol/L TSH 7.3 mU/L(135-145) (3.5-4.5) (95-106) (24-31) (3.6-6.3) (70-120) (3.5-7.0) (0.5-5.5)Serum calcium, magnesium and liver function tests were normal. Electrocardiogram showed peaked T waves. Chest X-ray was normal.  What is the likely diagnosis? Provide justifications.          Addison’s. Hyperpigmentation in scars, palmar creases, in mouth.      Sodium low, potassium high.      Weight loss.      No axillary/pubic hair:                  More likely to be primary vs central, since the adrenal glands make 3 types of hormones, so primary would affect all 3.          If central, multiple pathways must be affected.                    But then what about the TSH?                  Addison’s is autoimmune.          Could be autoimmne thyroid issue.          Makes them much more likely to have Addison’s.                      What do the peaked T-waves signify?          Hyperkalemia.        How would you confirm the diagnosis?          ACTH should be high in Addison’s (Primary adrenal insufficiency!?).      ACTH should be low in Central.      Problem with endocrinology is that you can’t do the same tests with high/low.        What is the most common cause of the disease in industrialized countries?          Autoimmune.      TB.        What therapy would you initiate immediately?  Why is the TSH elevated?          Autoimmune thyroiditis.      Glucocorticoids can suppress thyroid because feedback loops are intertwined.        What 2 persistent findings would cause you to initiate therapy with the oral mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone (Flornief)?          BP and potassium.      You actually titrate dose of Flornief by BP.      Case #7  Case Summary  Oliver is a 2-week-old brought into the ER by ambulance. In the past 24 hours he has been vomiting and dehydrated and his mother found him unconscious in his crib. They are from a small town outside of London and Oliver was born via home birth and didn’t undergo any newborn screening. Oliver is her first child.Laboratory results show:SerumNa 120 mmol/L (135-145) K 7.5 mmol/L (3.5-5.0) Glucose 2.7 mmol/L (3.4-7.0) Cortisol 97 nmol/L (119-618)  Based on the lab findings, what is currently happening to Oliver?          Adrenal insufficiency.      Since glucose and cortisol are affected, probably primary adrenal insfficiency.      CAH. 21-hydroxylase deficiency, something beta, another one.                  3 types.                    21-hydroxylase is most common.        Putting the history and lab findings together, what is your suspected diagnosis? List3 underlying causes.b) What would be the most common cause? What diagnostic test can you perform to confirm?  How will you manage Oliver: a) Acutely?b) In the long term?          Stress dose during ill or stress.      2-3 the amount depending on the stress level.        Oliver’s mother wants to know if her future children will have CAH. What do you tell her?  What preventative measures can you suggest to Oliver’s mother?          Dexamethasone until U/S to determine if female. Female is what you have to worry about.       Newborn screening.        17 LHP. Should be greatly elevated, right before the enzyme.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/endocrinology/2014/10/21/adrenal-focus-cases.html"},

	{"title": "Pharmacology of Adrenal Hormones and Steroid Hormone Receptors", "text": "  Lots of stereochemistry today which you don’t need to commit to memory, but you should be aware of it.  This is because, like most other things in biology, the function of the corticosteroids (glucocorticoids, mineralicorticoids), depends on the structure.          Additional structural changes which allow specific molecular properties to be accentuated or reduced and these have been incorporated in a wide range of synthetic steroids for use clinically.      BUNNYAll steroids based on 3 molecules.PregnaneAndrostaneEstraneNumbering of steroids based on the following:Good to know, DON’T MEMORIZE THIS. Such crazy numbering.Good chemical reasons for why the chemical numbering is in that order.Double bond between 4 and 5, double = d = delta in greek.So we call this a delta-4 steroid.Very planar, very flat. Can easily slide through cell membranes.Substituents can either be below or above plane of the ringsAbove = beta substituents.Below = alpha substituents.SHOWN IN BLACK IS WHAT’S NEEDED TO BE A CORTICOSTEROID.In red are some of the modifications that can be added to accentutate or suppress specific properties.eg. can add double bond at carbon-1 → delta-1 steroid.Or add a fluorine at carbon 9, protruding downward. Hence it’s a 9-α-fluoro-steroid.The various modifications alter the anti-inflammatory potency (GLUCOCORTICOID EFFECT), the Na+-retaining potency (MINERALICORTICOID EFFECT), the affinity for CBG, and the susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, which can modify bioavailability and duration of action.All corticosteroids have 3-keto; 4; 18,-Me &amp; 19,-Me; C-20 &amp; C-21; If O-11 (=O or -OH)  gluco; if no O-11  mineralo (Na+- ret), 17-OH  gluco.Addn of1gluco&amp;mineralo;6,-Me(+1)gluco&amp; mineralo; 9,-F   potency (gluco &amp; mineralo); 16-Me or 16-OH   mineralo &amp; ⇄ gluco; 17,-OH   gluco; 21-OH reqdfor  mineralo potency.So how come aldosterone is a potent mineralocorticoid when it has an O at position 11?	- Formation is unstable.	- In solution, forms a hemiacetal form which attenuates the effect of the oxygen and makes it a very potent mineralicorticoid.Why is cortisone 0.8 when it’s inactive? In brackets because it’s not particularly active, but this is representing conversion to cortisol by 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.Can’t use cortisone topically, because skin doesn’t have 11-b-HSD!So skin rash steroids will have cortisol, not cortisone (or prednisone).Fludrocortisone -&gt; big Min effect, used for mineralicorticoid replacement Tx. Looks strong on this scale, but this is relative to cortisol. Aldosterone would have something like 3000, so this is still much weaker than Aldo..", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/endocrinology/2014/10/14/pharmacology-adrenal-glucocorticoids-mineralicorticoids-androgen-receptors.html"},
	{"title": "Physiology of Adrenal Hormones and Steroid Hormone Receptors", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe the canonical structure of steroid hormone receptors.  Outline the mechanism of action of steroid hormone receptors.  List the tissue distribution for each receptor and its subtypes.  Define the major actions of each steroid receptor.  Be able to integrate knowledge of steroid receptor (and subtype) distribution and ligand binding properties with both disease etiology and pharmacological intervention.Steroid Hormone Receptors  The receptors and intracellular enzymes that facilitate the downstream response are more important than the enzymes themselves.  The adrenals primarily secrete hormones in response to stress.          The hormones that are released function to increase the availability of energy (ATP).      The best way to do this is to increase blood glucose, which is the major role of cortisol.      Functional Anatomy of the Adrenal Glands  The adrenal glands are comprised of an outer cortex and an inner medulla.          Adrenal Cortex                  Source of adrenal steroids.          Responsive to pituitary stimulation by ACTH (hence adreno-cortico-tropic hormone).                          Recall that Hypothalamic CRH (Corticotropin Releasing Hormone) triggers the release of ACTH, which triggers cortisol release from the adrenal cortex.                                Different parts of the cortex release different hormones. The 3 major zones are:                          Zona glomerulosa → secretes aldosterone.              Zona fasciculata → secretes cortisol.              Zona reticularis → secretes sex steroids.                                          Adrenal Medulla                   Source of catecholamines, produced by chromaffin cells.                          Catecholamines are what result in the faster response to stress (recall, ↑HR, bronchodilation, skeletal muscle vasodilation, etc).                                Secretion is controlled by direct neuroendocrine innervation.                      Corticosteroids refer to two kinds of steroid hormones that are synthesized in the adrenal cortex:          Glucocorticoids → eg. cortisol, which is made in the zona fasciculata.                  Named ‘gluco’-corticoids because they regulate gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake.                    Mineralicorticoids → eg. aldosterone, which is made in the zona glomerulosa.                  Named ‘minerali’-corticoids because they regulate the absorption of Sodium, which is a mineral.                      Corticosteroids are one of two kinds of steroid hormones that are synthesized in the adrenal cortex:          Corticosteroids = glucocorticoids + mineralicorticoids.      Adrenal Androgens, which are made in the zona reticularis.        Adrenal Cortex vs Adrenal Medulla      The cortex produces steroids:              Zona glomerulosa → secretes aldosterone.        Zona fasciculata → secretes cortisol.        Zona reticularis → secretes sex steroids.              The medulla produces catecholamines:              Secreted by chromaffin cells which comprise the medulla.            Adrenal Steroidogenesis  The adrenal cortex is responsible for the synthesis of steroid hormones.  There are intracellular enzymes that convert one steroid hormone to another.          These are cytochrome P450s → also known as the CYPs, eg. CYP17. Both naming schemes are interchangeable.      These cytochrome P450s are primarily found in the membranes of mitochondria and ER.      Key concept → it’s the relative ratio. of these enzymes in the target tissues that determines the effect of a steroid, because that’ll determine the end distribution of hormone.      Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis  As seen before, this a classic negative-feedback loop, similar to that with the thyroid.          Trigger is a stress → fear, cold, hypoglycemia.      Hypothalamus produces CRH.      Anterior pituitary produces ACTH in response.      Adrenal cortex produces cortisol, resulting in gluconeogenesis, muscle catabolism (producing amino acids), and inhibition of GLUT-4 (preventing glucose uptake into cells).      Cortisol negatively regulates CRH and ACTH levels.      The ACTH Receptor  the ACTH receptor is a GPCR coupled to cAMP.  Promotes the activity of Cholesterol Ester Hydrolase.          Converts cholesterol esters into cholesterol, which is necessary for the production of steroid hormones.        Rapidly increases production of StAR (the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis).          StAR = Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein → mobilizes cholesterol into mitochondria for further steroid hormone production.        So ACTH binding (1) increases creation of cholesterol and (2) increases movement of cholesterol into the mitochondria for steroid production.  These receptors are located primarily in zona reticularis and fasiculata, where cortisol and sex hormones are produced, respectively.Cortisol Transport &amp; Metabolism  Just like with the amino acid derivatives like thyroid hormone, Cortisol must be bound to a carrier protein for transport.  Just like TBG (Thyroxine binding globulin), with cortisol, we have CBG (Corticosteroid binding globulin).          75% of the cortisol in the plasma is bound to CBG (Corticosteroid Binding Globulin, aka. Transcortin). Don’t worry about the numbers, just remember that CBG is the dominant binding protein.      15% is bound to HSA (Human Serum Albumin).      10% is ‘free’ (at the end tissue destination) and biologically active.      ACTH and Cortisol Release  Cortisol release follows ACTH release, as expected.  They have both ultradian and diurnal rhythms.          We have an early morning spike in ACTH → Cortisol production.      But we also have regular patterns within each day of ACTH and cortisol production as well.      Steroid Hormone Receptors  Steroid hormone receptors are transcription factors, so their targets are genomic loci where they turn on/off specific genes.          They bind lipid soluble ligands in the cytosol.      They then move into the nucleus where they bind to specific genes.        Steroid hormone receptors have particular components:          Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) → binds the hormone.      DNA Binding Domain (DBD) → binds the genomic target. These targets are known as HREs (Hormone Response Elements).      Activation Function Domains (AFs) → interact with activating proteins.      Repression Domains (RDs) → interact with repressing proteins.      Nuclear Localization Sequence (NLS) → since the receptor has to get into the nucleus to bind its tarets.      Glucocorticoid &amp; Mineralicorticoid Receptors  We’ll primarily be focusing on glucocorticoid receptors and mineralicorticoid receptors.          Cortisol binds the Glucocorticoid Receptor.      Aldosterone binds the Mineralicorticoid Receptor.        However, there’s a vast number of receptor types, including ones that bind T3/T4, etc.  The ligand binding domains of these steroid receptors are often very similar.          This often means that we can have cross-reactivity of steroids with different hormone receptors.      For instance, glucocorticoids can bind the mineralicorticoid receptor, and vice versa.      Mineralicorticoid Receptor  Single isoform.  Largest of steroid hormone receptors.  Widely expressed in kidney, colon, heart, central nervous system (hippocampus), brown adipose tissue and sweat glands.  Natural ligands are aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone.  Many ligands are synthetic.  Regulates water/salt balance through activation of the distal tubule sodium channel and CNS actions to increase thirst.Glucocorticoid Receptor  Single isoform.  Expressed in all tissues.  Natural ligands include cortisol and cortisone.  Synthetic ligands well-known e.g. hydrocortisone, betamethasasone, dexamethasone etc.  Regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis, hepatic amino acid mobilization, inhibition of glucose uptake in muscle and fat (via inhibition of GLUT-4, recall), immune suppression (anti-inflammatory, like the steroids we give to patients), and maturation of the fetal lung.  Glucocorticoid vs Mineralicorticoid Receptor                             Glucocorticoid Receptor        Mineralicorticoid Receptor                            Natural Ligands        Cortisol, Cortisone        Aldosterone                    Location        Kidney, colon, heart, CNS, brown adipose tissue, sweat glands        All tissues                    Downstream Effects        (1) Hepatic gluconeogenesis(2) inhibition of GLUT-4 (↓ glucose uptake)(3) immune suppression(4) maturation of the fetal lung.        Regulation of water/salt balance via sodium channel regulation and CNS effects to increase thirst            Clinical Relevance of Cortisol Levels      We’ll be focusing here on cortisol only, since aldosterone is regulated outside of the pituitary via the RAAS system.Discovered by Thomas Addison, and Harvey Cushing, respectively.    The main diseases we’re dealing with are:          Addison’s Disease → Hypocortisolism.      Cushing’s Disease → Hypercortisolism.Some people refer to these enzymes as CYPs, others refer to them as P450, but it’s all the same.        We saw that both aldosterone and cortisol arise from a common precursor (cholesterol), and are produced via different enzymatic reactions (the CYP enzymes).  Depending on where you inhibit the hormone synthesis pathway, we can inhibit the production of different hormones.          In some cases we can inhibit both mineralicorticoids and glucocorticoids, or even the sex steroids as well!      The various pharmaceutical inhibitors and where they block these enzymatic pathways are shown below.        Hypocortisolism or hypercortisolism is clinically relevant because they have a number of effects:  Cortisol itself is a stress hormone, and causes the following:          Increases serum glucose and amino acids:                  ↑ protein metabolism to increase free amino acids.          ↑ amino acid uptake in the liver → increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis.          ↓ peripheral glucose uptake → increased circulating glucose.                    Increased Lipid and Bone Catabolism:                  ↑ lipid hydrolysis → increased circulating fatty acids.          ↑ bone and connective tissue catabolism → osteopenia, thinning of the skin and support structures.                    Enhances electrolyte and water balance:                  IMPORTANT: This isn’t a primary effect; it’s a consequence of cross-reactivity with the mineralicorticoid receptor.          ↑ Na+ reabsorption at the distal tubule. Recall that we saw this with the principal cell and α-intercalating cell in GU.          ↑ K+ excretion, H+ secretion (hypokalemia, alkalosis).                    Opposes the action of insulin:                  Will be important next week.                    11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  The last point above about how cortisol is cross-reactive with the mineralicorticoid receptor (MR) brings up an important issue.          Even though aldosterone binds the MR with much higher affinity, cortisol is present in the circulation in 100× the concentration.      So if you have too much cortisol, you can actually end up with a pronounced mineralicorticoid effect.        In order to protect the body from this, specific tissues express a particular enzyme called 11β-hydroxycorticosteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD), which can inactive cortisol, by converting it into cortisone.  More specifically, there are 2 isoforms of the 11β-hydroxycorticosteroid dehydrogenase enzyme.          11β-HSD-1, which converts inactive cortisone into active cortisol.      11β-HSD-2, which converts active cortisol into inactive cortisone.        So isoform 1 is an activating enzyme and isoform 2 is an inactivating enzyme. Of course, the inactivating enzyme is particularly important.  These two isoforms are located in different regions:          11β-HSD-1 is expressed mainly in the liver.      11β-HSD-2 is expressed mainly in the kidney.        Hence, cortisol is activated in the liver, and inactivated in the kidney.  Inherited errors in structure or expression of 11β-HSD-2 cause a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME).          This is because blocking inactivation of cortisol into cortisone leads to lots of active glucocorticoid, which can bind the mineralicorticoid receptor.      This primarily results in hypertension.        Dutch black licorice, which we saw in Genitourinary, contains Glycyrrhizic acid, which is a potent inhibitor of 11β-HSDs, and thus can also leads to symptoms of AME.  11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase      11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase exists in two isoforms:              11β-HSD-1:                      Converts inactive cortisone into active cortisol.            Primarily located in the liver.                          11β-HSD-2                      Converts active cortisol into inactive cortisone.            Primarily located in the kidney.                                11β-HSD-2 is also expressed in the placenta:          The idea is that, in pregnancy, the mother makes a lot more cortisol than the baby.      Cortisol can flow into the placenta, and fetal hypercortisolism can lead to intrauterine growth restriction, and pre-eclampsia.      To protect against this, the placenta expresses the inactivating 11β-HSD-2, to convert the cortisol into cortisone, and relieve the load on the fetus.

Its inferior poles extend laterally and inferiorly, approximately the distance of one tracheal ring.  See these Neck Anatomy Notes from last year.Embryology of the Thyroid  Originates from the foramen cecum, between the first and second pharyngeal arches.  The superior thyroid originates from the fourth pharyngeal pouch  The inferior thyroid originates from the third pharyngeal pouch  Descends during fetal development to its final position.  Sometimes a tract is left behind during the descent, which becomes the pyramidal lobe.          This pyramidal lobe can sometimes cause disease and may require surgical excision.      Indications for Thyroidectomy  Compression of surrounding structures (e.g. trachea, esophagus, etc.)  Aesthetics (goitre can be disfiguring)  Hyperthyroidism (usually when patient fails medical therapy)  Parathyroidectomy (the parathyroids may be “hiding” in the thyroid)  Other Surgery (e.g. hypopharyngeal cancer, which may require resection of surrounding tissues)  Thyroid Cancer  Undiagnosed Nodule (patients with an indeterminate FNAB result may opt for resection instead of further investigation, which may result in resection anyways)Surgical Consultation  Complete History          Nodules &gt;1cm      Enlarging      Family history      History of neck irradiation         Physical Exam          Stridor/hoarseness      Lymphadenopathy      Vocal cord function        Investigations          Laryngoscopy      FNAB      The OperationI don’t think these steps are terribly important to know at this stage, but I’ve included them for the sake of completeness.

	{"title": "Thyroid/Parathyroid Focal Cases", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary  A 50-year old woman presents with a 6-month history of weight loss (40 lbs) despite a voracious appetite, severe palpitations, and uncontrollable shakiness. She feels very hot and sweaty and can’t get to sleep at night.  Upon examination, the following is discovered. Her heart rate is 130/min and her blood pressure is 138/90. Her skin is warm, velvety and moist and there is a fine tremor of her hands. She has a noticeable stare and lid lag as well as chemosis and scleral injection. Her thyroid is diffusely enlarged and meaty with loud systolic and diastolic bruits over both lobes. There is a Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the aortic area.  Laboratory investigations reveal the following:      TSH &lt; 0.10 mU/L (0.3-4.5)    Free T4 51 pmol/L (9-22)    Note: there’s a subtle difference between hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis.          Hyperthryoidism → an overactive thyroid gland.      Thyrotoxicosis → high blood levels of thyroid hormone.        So thyroiditis would be thyrotoxicosis, not hyperthyroidism, since the thyroid isn’t overactive, it’s just inflammed.Questions  What diagnosis is most consistent with the above history?          Hyperthyrodism.        Name 4 thyroid conditions that can cause an elevated FT4 and FT3.          Graves’ Disease.      Toxic Adenoma → one nodule in the thyroid.      Toxic Multinodular Goiter → multiple nodules in the thyroid.      Thyroiditis → inflammation of the thyroid gland, causing a release of thyroid hormones.        What is the most likely cause of her elevated FT4 and FT3? Justify your conclusions from the history, physical exam and lab tests.          Graves’ Disease.      Female, middle aged, consistent with Graves.      Ocular symptoms → stare and lid lag.                  Eye symptoms due to antibody attack of the extra-ocular muscles.                    Diffuse, homogeneous enlargement.        a) What other test(s) would or could you order to confirm the diagnosis? b) What additional information would the(se) test(s) provide?          Radioactive Iodine Scan → to differentiate between Graves’ (diffuse uptake) versus a toxic adenoma (focal uptake).      Antibodies → specific for Graves’ disease. Usually not necessary, if history is suggestive.        List two mechanisms involved in producing her cardiovascular symptoms and signs.          Increased heart rate and contractility because of increased catecholamine sensitivity.      Tremors also due to increased sympathetic activity.        What treatment would you recommend to this lady? List the common side- effects of these treatments and consider any limitations in the quality of life of this patient because of their administration. Consider the variation in the administration of these drugs internationally. (United States, Europe, Japan, etc).          Methimazole → first line treatment.      Propylthiouracil → second line, except in the first trimester of pregnancy.                  Worried about Methimazole in the first trimester for teratogenic effects, so Propylthiouracil is used in the first trimester only, and then switched to Methimazole.                    Rare risk of agranulocytosis → a rare and dangerous side effect.      Rare risk of liver toxicity → higher with propylthiouracil.      Medication is used most as 1st line treatment in Canada.      Surgery is used more in Europe.      Radioactive Iodine Ablation is used most in the US.                  Not used in Japan → obvious stigma with radiation.          Contraindicated in pregnancy.          They usually also trigger radiation alarms in airports for a few months after treatment!                      Could she have a diagnosis of Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis? Why or why not?          No. Even though you have a transient hyperthyroidism due to release of the thyroid hormone from destroyed cells, it wouldn’t have lasted 6 months.      She would have hypothyroidism by now if it was Hashimoto’s.      Case #2  Case Summary  A 26-year old female complains of palpitations that have been constant over the past two weeks but seem worse at night. She states that they are regular and it feels as if her heart is going to jump out of her chest. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. She recently delivered a normal baby boy during an uncomplicated delivery 5 1⁄2 weeks before this visit. She has been feeling a bit warm lately, and complains of feeling tired but being unable to get a good night sleep. Her review of systems was remarkable for loose stools occurring approximately 4 times/day. She feels that her mind is racing and denies heat or cold intolerance.  Upon physical examination, her blood pressure was 146/90 and her pulse was 96. She showed a fine tremor of the hands. Her thyroid was approximately 1.5 times normal in size, symmetrically enlarged, firm, non-tender with carotids palpable bilaterally without bruits.  Lab Investigations:- FT4 16.2 (9-22)- TSH &lt;0.05 (0.3 – 4.5)Questions  What is the state of her thyroid function?          Subclinical Hyperthyroidism.      Why is her TSH still low, even though her Free T4 is normal?                  There’s a lag time for the TSH to normalize, so maybe she only just recently had overt hyperthyroidism.          Symptoms seem to agree with this.                      What is the likeliest cause of the thyroid problem?          Post-partum thyroiditis.        She denies feeling depressed and you are not sure whether the clinical presentation warrants a more thorough investigation of her mental state. Should you investigate more thoroughly? Investigate the correlation between depression and your proposed diagnosis in this patient population.          Still no good evidence suggestive of a link between post-partum depression and post-partum thyroiditis.        What other investigations should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis?          None → post-partum thyroiditis is a clinical diagnosis.      We can’t do a radioactive iodine scan, because it’s contraindicated in breast-feeding mothers.      She also seems to be recovering already.        Describe and discuss the clinical and laboratory presentation of this disorder. Ensure that you understand the natural history of this disorder.          Post-partum thyroiditis usually gets better on its own.      About a third of women will go hyperthyroid → euthyroid.      Another third of women will go hyperthyroid → hypothyroid → euthyroid.      A final third of women will go hypothyroid → euthyroid.      However, a quarter to half of all of these will end up with chronic hypothyroidism after 10 years.        What would you do to treat this patient? Is treatment required?          Follow up with her until recovery.      No treatment is required.        What does this mean for her future management?          Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal antibodies may develop after.                  Recall that these were signs of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.                    So they may have hypothyroidism down the line.      Case #3  Case Summary  A 60-year-old lady presents with a 6-month history of weight gain (despite a poor appetite), cold intolerance, dry skin and hair, hoarseness of the voice and generalized puffiness. Lately she had developed retrosternal heaviness with minimal activity relieved by rest.  On examination, her skin was cool and dry with generalized edema. Oral temperature is 36.3 ̊C. Heart rate is 52 BPM. Blood pressure is 140/90. The thyroid was diffusely enlarged and firm. There was dullness at the right lung base with decreased vocal and tactile fremitus. Heart sounds were barely audible. The relaxation phase of the reflexes was delayed and there was pseudomyotonia on striking the deltoids.Pseudomyotonia -&gt; delayed relaxation of the muscles.  What one test would you do to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism?          TSH.        Describe and discuss the two major mechanisms involved in the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism, giving 3 examples of each that this lady had.          Slowing of the metabolic processes:                  Cold intolerance.          Reduced heart rate.          Weight gain.                    Accumulation of glycoaminoglycans:                  Edema, puffiness.          Hoarseness.                      a) How would you treat this woman’s hypothyroidism? b) *Describe why you would choose that particular treatment regimen?          Synthroid. orally.      Start low, go up slowly.        What would you do about the enlarged firm goitre?          Nothing, unless it’s a high risk nodule.      If not responsive to treatment, do an ultrasound to look for nodules.      Recall that you should avoid unnecessarily going for an ultrasound, because you have to follow them down the entire diagnostic chain, if you find an incidental nodule.      Case #4  Case Summary  A 68-year-old man is critically ill in the Intensive Care Unit. His thyroid function tests reveal the following:      TSH: 1.0 mU/L (0.3-4.5).    FT4: 8.0 mmol/L (9-22).    FT3: 1.5 mmol/L (3.5-6.5).    You think that his thyroid indices can be explained by Non-Thyroidal Illness (NTI), since they are critically ill, with a normal TSH, but low FT4 and FT3.Questions  Research and discuss the characteristics of NTI.          NTI = Non-thyroidal Illness.      The thyroid isn’t really dysfunctional, it’s just as a consequence of the patient’s critical illness.      Two mechanisms:                  There’s an increased conversion to reverse T3 instead of FT3, resulting in lower FT3 levels.          The pituitary is less responsive to low FT3 and FT4.                      What is Euthyroid Sick Syndrome? Explore this and NTI in terms of prevalence and what they mean for patients.          They’re pretty much the same → they’re synonyms.      Increased prevalence with severely ill patients.      What happens when you get better? Your thyroid hormone levels go back to normal; if not, then there is an underlying issue.        Discuss whether these responses are adaptive or maladaptive.          The levels seen in NTI       Still controversial → some people believe that a decreased metabolic rate is an adaptation to reduce bodily maintenance needs in patients that are critically ill.      Other people believe that it’s maladaptive response.      Case #5  Case Summary  A 44-year-old woman recently immigrated from Iraq presents with goitre. She does not have drug coverage.Questions  What issues need to be considered with this presentation and this patient?          Questions -&gt; symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.      Iodine deficiency.      PTU is covered, Methimazole isn’t in ODB.      No drug coverage.        Discuss international health issues and the idea of an ‘endemic goitre’. Which immigrant populations are largely affected by this phenomenon?  What investigations would you do on this patient? Why?          History and physical exam → look for signs of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.      Obstructive Symptoms → hoarseness, dysphagia, etc.        Discuss what you think might be the patient’s objectives in seeing you. What concerns may patients have that cause them to see a physician for a goitre?          Because they have a huge, ugly lump in their neck.      They might have compressive symptoms, or symptoms of hypo/hyperthyroidism.        What management plan would you develop for this patient?          Hx, P/E.      Thyroid tests → TSH.      Subsequent management based on this.        On a follow-up visit, you discover that the patient has ended up taking an herbal preparation rich in Iodine. What should you consider now in terms of thyroid function? How will your management of the patient change?          Iodine can cause both hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.      Should repeat history, physical exam, and thyroid tests.        Upon further reading on this topic, you discover that there are variations in the thyroid function in goitre. Research and discuss the Wolff-Chaikoff effect and the Jod-Basedow phenomenon (this is particularly applicable to the ingestion of the iodine load in our patient).          Jod is German for iodine.      Wolff-Chaikoff Effect → transient increase in thyroid hormone production due to increased substrate. Then late decrease in production to       Jod-Basedow Effect → hyperthyroidism due an iodine load, failure to escape?!      Case #6  Case Summary  A 35-year-old woman noticed a lump on the right side of her neck when she was brushing her teeth. She noticed it moved up and down when she swallowed and found that she experienced some difficulty swallowing solids and liquids. However, she has not experienced any change in her voice or other discomfort. She does note that the mass seems to have enlarged since the discovery. She has lost 20 lbs in weight over the past 6 months despite a good appetite. She has otherwise been well and denies any other symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism. There is no family history of thyroid disease.Questions  Describe the four methods in which you could investigate this nodule.          TSH → if it’s a hot nodule (low TSH), then it’s less likely to be cancer than with a cold nodule.      Ultrasound → look for nodules, size.      Radioactive Uptake Sign → look for localization, whether it’s a hot/cold nodule.      FNAB → to get a diagnostic result (benign/malignant).        You perform a Fine Needle Aspiration that is read as “indeterminate”. What does this mean to you and the patient?          It means you didn’t get enough cells, or they’re too clumped together.      You have to do the biopsy again.        What is the sensitivity and specificity of these tests?          Both the sensitivity and specificity are pretty high.      Unless it’s an indeterminate sample.        How do pathologists arrive at the diagnosis of thyroid cancer?          They do some magic voodoo stuff when they look at the cells.      Papillary Thyroid Cancer → big nuclei (often crowded with clefts and grooves).        How would you manage this young woman’s condition?          Repeat the FNAB again.      Hemithyroidectomy, if it’s still an indeterminate lesion.        After your initial examination, your patient has researched her condition on the internet and now harbours numerous ‘internet fears’. How will you quell these fears? Anticipate your patient’s concerns and address these within your groups.          Worried about incision to neck, or anesthesia.      If indeterminate, worried the surgery may be unncessary, since       Find out what their needs are, what they’re worried about, blah blah blah.      Case #7  Case Summary  A 47-year old woman you diagnosed with Graves’ opts for a total thyroidectomy due to her large thyroid size. 5 days post-op she is brought into hospital after having a seizure. Her family mentions that 2 days prior she had been complaining of “pins and needles” in her fingers and toes, and around her lips.  Her laboratory findings are:- TSH: 2.4 mU/L (0.3-4.5).- Ca: 1.84 mmol/L (2.12-2.62).- Albumin: 40 g/L (35-50).- Na: 137 mmol/L (135-145).- K: 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-4.5).- Glucose: 4.8 (3.6-6.3).  Everything’s normal, except for her low calcium.  What would you say about her calcium if her albumin.          Correct calcium by albumin level (since calcium binds to albumin in the body).      Since her albumin is normal, this is true hypocalcemia.      Questions  She is now awake and alert after recovering from her seizure. What are two clinical signs can you examine for?Trusseau’s Sign.Put it above the systolic (20-30), keep it there for 3 minutes, see if they have the carpal spasm.Quite painful :(Also known as the man duchuchau!?!?! (Hand of the Obstetrician).ChuaSteks sign.Facial nerve twitchingEye twitches, blah?15% of normal people can have it though, so not that specific.HyperreflexiaIncreased deep tendon reflexes.  a) What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?Removed her parathyroid glands, resulting in hypoparathyroidism.Small, may have missed ‘emb) What other lab investigation(s) would confirm the etiology of her hypocalcemia?Ca -&gt; would be low.PTH -&gt; would be low.Vitamin D -&gt; would be low.Phosphate -&gt; would be high. (since PTH promotes phosphate excretion from kidney)Need the PTH for the hydroxylation steps.How do you DDx Vitamin D deficiency and Hypoparathyroidism.Both have low calcium and vitamin D.PTH shouldn’t be low in vitamin D deficiency, should be high to try and increase absorption.ALSO DIFFERENCE IN PHOSPHATE.PsuedohypoparathyroidismPTH resistant.Only difference is that PTH level is high.Ca, Vitamin D, Phosphate otherwise the same.MAKE A CHART.  How would you manage her acutely?SHORT TERM MANAGEMENT.Give her calcium.Calcium gluconate.  What do you tell her about her long-term management?LONG TERM MANAGEMENT.Could be short term (stunning of parathyroid due to strain on blood supply), or could be permanent.May need long term calcium and Vitamin D (to improve absorption) supplementation.Recall Calcitriol is the biologically active form of Vitamin D.Target serum calcium level is on the low side of normal, to try and stimulate them parathyroids in case they’re only transiently stunned.Also, better to keep Ca low to prevent kidney stones.Recombinant PTH used in osteoporosisWhy not hypoparathyroidism? Technically, it should work. If you don’t have PTH, why don’t you just give ‘em it?	But it’s (a) EXPENSIVE, and (b) INJECTED.Will need levothyroxine due to her total thyroidectomy.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/endocrinology/2014/10/09/thyroid-parathyroid-focal-cases.html"},

A Framework for Thyroid Disorders  For a review of material from last year, see The Thyroid.How do Patients Present?  You have symptoms:          Related to Structure.      Related to Function.        Many patients actually present incidentally, because they’re picked up on imaging for something completely different (eg. due to a carotid ultrasound, or a head CT).Assessing Function  Thyroid function can be assessed with:          Serum TSH → look at pituitary stimulation.      Serum Free T3/ Free T4 (FT3/FT4) → free thyroid hormone is measured so the effects of binding proteins are ignored.        With Thyrotoxicosis (~Hyperthyroid), you have less TSH because the pituitary doesn’t stimulate the thyroid since it’s already active, and the free T3/T4 are elevated.  With a Primary Hypothyroid problem, you have more TSH (the pituitary gland tries to stimulate the thyroid), and the free T3/T4 fall.  The TSH is the most sensitive test of thyroid function.          It can detect subclinical hyperthyroidism/hypothyroidism, where the TSH has fallen/risen respectively, but the FT3/FT4 hasn’t changed yet.        Finally, there are central causes of hypo/hyperthroidism:          Here, the TSH doesn’t change, or changes in the wrong direction, in response to T3/T4 levels.        For a better conceptual grasp of how TSH and FT3/FT4 can be used to differentiate thyroid problems, see below:   Summary Diagrams  Hyperthyroidism  Note that we’ll be dealing specifically with thyrotoxicosis, which is different from hyperthyroidism:          Hyperthryoidism → an overactive thyroid gland.      Thyrotoxicosis → high blood levels of thyroid hormone.        Practically, this means that you can thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism (eg. with ingestion of external hormone).Characteristics of Thyrotoxicosis  Symptoms:          Heat intolerance, Increased sweating.      Tremor, Palpitations, Hyperactivity, Insomnia.      Emotional lability/Anxiety.      Weight loss despite increased appetite.      Increased GI motility/Hyperdefecation.        Signs:          Tremor.      Soft, warm, skin.      Increased heart rate.      Increased cardiac output.        If the thyrotoxicosis is secondary to Graves’ Disease, then you’ll have some associated eye symptoms:          Stare → decreased blink.      Lid retraction → the eyelid will be retracted, so you can see the top of the sclera.      Lid lag → the iris and pupil will move faster than the eyelid      Proptosis → eyes actually pushed forward.      Periorbital edema.      Diplopia → double vision, here often with an upward gaze.      Visual loss → emergency, requires urgent optho referral.        Those that proptosis and exopthalmos are both used to describe protrustion of the eyes.  Exophthalmos also describes forward protrusion of the globe. Several authors use the terms differently, which is confusing:          Proptosis and exophthalmos are often used interchangeably.      Exophthalmos is sometimes used to refer to severe (over 18 mm) proptosis.      Exophthalmos is sometimes also used to refer to endocrine-related proptosis.      An Approach to Thyrotoxicosis  Thyrotoxicosis is a high level of thyroid hormone in the blood.  This can have many causes:          Increased Thyroid Hormone Synthesis → Hyperthyroidism.      Increased Release of Thyroid Hormone → Tissue damage to the Thyroid.      Exogeneous Thyroid Hormone → Ingestion of external factors.        With respect to Increased thyroid hormone synthesis, there are many causes, but it’s best to focus on the most common ones:          Immune Mediated (Antibody) Stimulation of the TSH Receptor.                  Grave’s Disease is the most common example.                    Autonomous Thyroid Tissue → a growth.                  Toxic Multinodular Goitre → multiple nodules.          Toxic Adenoma → one nodule.                    Graves’ Disease  This is the archetypical cause of increased thyroid hormone synthesis.  Pathophysiology          Autoimmune: stimulation of TSH receptor by antibody (thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin).      Constitutive stimulation results in hyperplasia and hypertrophy.      Eye complications are due to increased volume of the retro-orbital connective tissues and extraocular muscles.                  This is caused by the induction of thyroblasts to produce mucoid like material. These then mature into fat cells (depending on what genes they turn on).          This results in inflammation, edema, + glycosamines + glycans, resulting in exophthalmos.                      Most common cause of hyperthyroidism.          Women &gt; Men.      30-50 yrs &gt; Young/old.      Systemic, ocular and skin manifestations.      Diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland.        Histology:          Top → Graves’ disease.                  Hyperplastic follicle cells form small, simple, papillary projections into lumen          Prominent ‘scalloping’ of the colloid.                    Bottom → normal thyroid.                  Evenly spaced follicle cells form oval/round follicles.                      Diagnosis:          History and physical exam.                  P/E can help confirm Graves’ Disease with bulging of the eyes.          But if you don’t see it, you can still have Graves’, because most patients with Graves’ won’t present with orbitopathies.                    TSH, free T4 and T3.                  The best test to order initially is the TSH.          If it’s normal, then you really need to have a high pre-test probability to continue investigations.                    TBII (ie. TSH-Receptor antibodies) → Thyrotropin Binding Inhibitory Immunoglobulins.                  Typically not used, because the TSH, FT3/FT4, and Hx and P/E are usually sufficient to make the diagnosis.          TBII measurement is useful in pregnancy as Radioactive Iodine Uptake and Scan is contraindicated because it will damage the fetal thyroid and can result in congenital hypothyroidism.          So TBII’s is used to diagnose Graves’ Disease in the pregnant.          This is important because the TSH-receptor antibodies can target the fetal thyroid and cause fetal hyperthyroidism.                    Radioactive Iodine Uptake → should have diffuse uptake vs. localized uptake (which would be seen with a toxic multinodular goitre or a toxic adenoma).                  We saw this last year in the Thyroid lecture.                      Treatment          Drugs → ie. Methimazole, Propylthiouracil.                  Methimazole is first line, except for the first trimester of pregnancy, in which case Propylthiouracil is used.          Both have a small risk of agranulocytosis; Propylthiouracil has an additional risk of causing a fulminant hepatitis.          More common in Europe &amp; Japan.                    Radioactive Iodine Therapy                  Often results in permanent hypothyroidism (although, as was mentioned last lecture, this may be done intentionally, to avoid having to re-treat for hyperthyroidism).          Contraindicated in pregnancy.          Can often exacerbate Graves’ opthalmopathy (especially in smokers).          Most commonly used in Canada and the USA.                    Surgical Thyroidectomy                  Permanent hypothyroidism.          Surgical risks include hypoparathyroidism (the parathyroid glands are small and difficult to dissect), and laryngeal nerve injury.          More common in Europe.                      Diagnostic Features for increased Hormone Synthesis    Treatment of Graves’ Disease  Thyroiditis  This is the archetypical cause of increased thyroid hormone release.  Thyroiditis → inflammation resulting in damage to the thyroid gland.          Most commonly because of a viral infection.      Patients will often have had a previous infection.        When you perform a radioactive iodine uptake scan in a patient with thyroiditis, you’ll see something like what’s on the right.  You’ll see very poor localization, suggesting poor uptake due to thyroid damage.  Types of Thyroiditis:          Viral/Post-viral → also sometimes called de Quervain’s, or ‘painful’ thyroiditis.      Autoimmune → also sometimes called ‘painless’, ‘silent’.                  Can get a transient autoimmune hyperthyroidism with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, due to release of thyroid hormone from destroyed thyroid tissue.          This is referred to as Hashitoxicosis.                    Drug Induced.      Radiation Induced.      Traumatic → eg. a craptastically vigorous thyroid exam.        Management of Thyroiditis:          Nothing that you can really do except wait for the thyroid to recover and to ensure that your diagnosis is correct.      Treat their symptoms → beta-blockers to lower their heart rate, etc.      Monitor for resolution, and for hypothyroidism. After the thyroid tissue has been destroyed, and the released thyroid hormone is gone, the patient is at risk for hypothyroidism.      HypothyroidismCharacteristics of Hypothyroidism  Symptoms:          Cold intolerance.      Weight gain despite decreased appetite.      Fatigue, slow mentation, apathy, constipation.      Shortness of breath.        Signs:          Cool, pale skin.      Decreased heart rate.      Diastolic Hypertension/narrow pulse pressure.                  Most people expect patients with hypothyroidism to have hypotension, but you actually have diastolic hypertension.          The idea here is that the heart pumps less strongly, hence the narrow pulse pressure. To compensate for this, the diastolic blood pressure rises to maintain the mean arterial pressure, resulting in diastolic hypertension.                    Decreased cardiac output.      Slow relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes.                  The actual reflex will be fast, but the relaxation will be slowed.                    An Approach to Hypothyroidism  Differential Diagnosis:          Autoimmune Destruction is the most common cause.                  Of these, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis is the most common disease.                    Drugs → lithium, amiodarine.      Removal of the Thyroid Gland → surgery, radioactive iodine.      Decreased Central Stimulation → trauma, surgery, tumour, infiltrative diseases.        It’s easy to differentiate between a primary cause and a central cause of hypothyroidism.          If it’s a primary cause, the TSH should be high, to try and stimulate the thyroid.      If it’s a central cause, the TSH will be low or inappropriately normal, relative to the levels of FT3/FT4.      Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis  Also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.  Like Graves’ disease, it’s also a disease that’s mediated by auto-antibodies.          Unlike with Graves’, where you have Ab binding to the TSH receptor, with Hashimoto’s you have antibodies against the thyroid tissue itself.        This results in antibody-mediated destruction of the thyroid tissue.  Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.  As with most auto-immune diseases, it presents most often in women in their early/mid adulthood.  Unlike Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis doesn’t have any extra-thyroidal manifestations.  There are short term and long term consequences of the thyroid damage:          Short term → enlarged, nodular, rubbery gland.      Long term → lymphoid aggregates, Hurthle cells, fibrosis, shrinkage.        Hurthle cells are characterized as enlarged epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm as a result of altered mitochondria.  Graves’ Disease vs. Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis                             Grave’s Disease        Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis                            Antibody Target        TSH Receptor        Thyroid Tissue                    Results in        Hyperthyroidism        Hypothyroidism (may have transient hyperthyroidism)                    Seen typically in        Middle aged women        Middle aged women                    Treatment        (1) Thyroidectomy(2) Radioactive Iodine(3) Medication (Methimazole, Propylthiouracil)        Levothyroxine              Diagnosis:          History → other autoimmune diseases, hypothyroid symptoms.      P/E → rubbery goitre.      TSH, followed by FT4 if TSH is high.      There are anti-TPO and/or anti-thyroglobulin Abs, which are pathognomonic, but usually not necessary to make a diagnosis.        Treatment:          Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine.      Titrate to normal TSH.      Disorders of Thyroid Structure  When you have a problem with thyroid structure, it can either be diffuse or focal:          Diffuse Enlargement → goitre.      Focal Enlargement → nodule.        Possible structural symptoms include:          Hoarseness → close proximity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.      Stridor → compression of the trachea.      Dysphagia → compression of the esophagus.      Swelling of the neck.        Goitre → enlargement of the thyroid gland.          Sometimes described as ‘multinodular’.      Can by associated with disturbances of thyroid function (hypo- or hyper-).      For instance, toxic multinodular goitre is a goitre with increased thyroid function.      Simple/Multinodular Sporadic Goiter  Most common thyroid disease in North America.  Idiopathic, most commonly seen in young women.  Typically see asymmetric enlargement of the gland.  Pathological Changes:          Early → hyperplastic, active thyroid tissue.      Late → less active, hemorrhage, cysts, calcification, fibrosis.        Diagnosis:          Hx and P/E (feel the thyroid).      Ultrasound (recall the criteria we saw last year in our Thyroid lecture.).      RAI uptake and scan to differentiate a hot nodule from a cold nodule (cold nodules are more likely to be malignant).        Treatment:          No intervention/monitoring if minor.      RAI ablation if it’s hyperfunctioning.      Surgery if compressive symptoms.      Investigating Thyroid Nodules  This is exactly the same as what we saw last year; in fact, it was probably better explained back then.  Please read the Thyroid lecture.  The thresholds for FNAB are somewhat different in this lecture:          &gt; 2 cm almost always biopsy, unless it’s a simple cyst.      &lt; 1 cm almost never biopsy      1-2 cm depends:                  Clinical → Growth, family history, radiation, hard, LNs.          Ultrasound → Solid, hypoechoic, calcifications, irregular, LNs.                      The treatment depends on the result of the FNAB, and is exactly the same as what we saw last year:Thyroid CancersParafollicular cells are also called C-cells, presumably since they secrete calcitonin.  Recall that we have follicular cells, which secrete thyroid hormone and parafollicular cells, which secrete calcitonin.  We can have cancers derived from either of these.  Follicular Cell Derived:          Papillary (Most common).      Follicular      Anaplastic        Parafollicular Cell Derived:          Medullary.-There are also follicular adenomas, which are the only benign thyroid neoplasm.      Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma  The majority of all thyroid cancers.  Most are indolent, and are seen in women.  Nuclear features are diagnostic:          These include enlargement, irrecular and notched nuclear membranes, grooves, inclusions, and clear nuclei.        Calcifications are characteristic, but not pathognomonic.          Concentric calcifications are known as Psammoma bodies.        Treatment:          Total thyroidectomy + thyroid hormone replacement.      Post op radioactive iodine and TSH suppression to ‘finish off’ the tumour.      Excellent prognosis.      Follicular Adenoma  Only benign thyroid neoplasm.  Encapsulated, with no lympovascular invasion.  Lack the nuclear features of PTC.Follicular Carcinoma  Older women.  Usually at least partially encapsulated.  Will have invasion of the capsule and vessels.  Will often have metastasis to distant sites, particularly the bones and the lungs.Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma  Thought to represent progression of a PTC or a FC into a more malignant phenotype.  Uniformly lethal, extremely aggressive.  Histologically unidentifiable → poorly differentiated, complete loss of architecture.Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma  Tumors of parafollicular “C” cells responsible for Calcitonin production.  Can be sporadic, or familial.          Sporadic → 80%, presents as a mass, middle age.      Familial → 20%, presents bilaterally, younger age, associated with MEN (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia).        Aggressive → 40% 10 yr survival.  Lab diagnosis → Calcitonin levels.          Recall that calcitonin doesn’t seem to be too critical in humans, except that it can be used as a marker for medullary carcinomas.        Histological Features:          Tumour cells form sheets and nests and have uniform nuclei with a stippled (salt and pepper) chromatin pattern typical of neuroendocrine tumours.      A very helpful feature is the presence of abundant extracellular homogeneous pink material which, like amyloid, is red with Congo Red staining.      Immunohistochemical examination using antibodies against calcitonin shows that these tumours contain calcitonin in contrast to other thyroid tumours which contain thyroglobulin.

	{"title": "Thyroid Pharmacology", "text": "Lecture Objectives  List the drugs used in treating hyperthyroid conditions.  Describe the pharmacology, kinetics and mechanism of action of the thioamides and anionic inhibitors.  Describe the adverse effects associated with use of the drugs used in treating hyperthyroidism.  Describe the therapeutic uses of iodide and iodinated contrast media.  Describe the therapeutic and diagnostic uses of radioactive iodine.  Describe the adverse effects associated with the use of iodine and iodinated compounds.Thyroid PharmacologyYou don’t need to know this stereochemistry for the final, but it’s still pretty neat!  Recall that there are 2 forms of T3 → T3, and rT3 (reverse T3).  One is highly active, and the other is inactive. Why is there a difference?          You can have 2 different binding arrangements of 3 iodines on the aromatic rings.                  3,5,3’-tri-iodothyronine (T3) is a highly active thyroid hormone.          3,3’,5’-tri-iodothyronine (rT3) is inactive.                    The ether group between the two aromatic rings has a bent shape, meaning that the 2 rings in the thyroid hormone aren’t coplanar; they’re bent.      Iodine is a big atom, so when the iodine groups are attached proximally to the ether group, they’re so big that they cause the bond to twist.      This changes the shape of the rT3 hormone so it doesn’t fit the receptor, making it inactive.        The asterisk marks a location where there can be enantiomerism.           So there can be L-thyroxine, and D-thyroxine.      All active thyroid hormones are in a L-configuration.      L-thyroxine = levothyroxine, which is what’s given to patients with hypothyroidism.      There is also a D-configuration thyroxine, which is comparatively unimportant (it has lipid lowering properties).      Conversion of T4 to T3  Recall that most T3 is produced in peripheral tissue, converted from T4.  Conversion (activation) occurs by removing the 5’ iodine of the outer ring of T4.  Although T4 still has a biological effect, it’s so much weaker than that of T3 that it can be considered a prohormone for T3.  The deiodinases that convert T4 → T3 are stereoselective, and require a selenium prosthetic group.          In extremely rare instances of selenium deficiency, we can have impaired conversion of T4 → T3.        The two deiodinases we saw in the last lecture were D2 and D3.  Recall that D3 not only converts T4 to rT3 (inactive), but also T3 to T2.  In other words, D3 is an inactivator of thyroid hormone.  Remember      D2 is a thyroid hormone activator (it converts T4 → T3).    D3 is a thyroid hormone inactivator (it converts T4 → rT3, and T3 → T2).  Treatment of Hypothyroidism  Causes of Hypothyroidism:          Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis → most common cause, especially in women. Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.      Impaired hormone synthesis.      Destruction of thyroid tissue (eg. irradiation, surgery).      Secondary to pituitary/hypothalmic problems (eg. TSH deficit).      Congenital (cretinism).      Pharmacological (eg. following consumption of antithyroid drugs/foods).        Pharmacological treatment of hypothyroidism is by replacement therapy.          Replacement therapy is so effective that we actually use it to treat hyperthyroidism now, by removing the thyroid gland, and then using replacement hormone.        Hormone preparations are either animal source extracts or synthetic hormone.          The latter is by far a better choice, because animal extracts are less pure, and may have antigens that trigger an immune reaction.      Synthetic T4 is available as levothyroxine, aka. Synthroid©.      Synthetic T3 is available as liothyronine, aka. Cytomel©.        An example of an animal source extract is thyroid dessicated USP.          USP = United States Pharmacopeia. A pharmacopeia is a drug listing, which includes standards and records of old drugs      There’s a site online called ‘Stop the Thyroid Madness’ that is full of (wrong) material about how synthetic hormone causes horrible side effects.      They advocate the use of animal extract, which ironically is even more likely to have material in it that will lead to an allergic response.        Synthetic T4 is the hormone of choice because T4 has a more consistent potency, and a longer duration of action.  T3 is used only occassionally, when a faster onset of action is required (eg. with a myxedema coma):          Myxedema coma → a loss of brain function as a result of severe, longstanding hypothyroidism.        Synthetic hormones have few side effects, aside from those that are a consequence of their biological function (eg. increased heart rate, increased metabolism, tremors, etc). These are known as extension effects.          These symptoms may often mimic sympathetic hyperactivity.        The usual tablet dosage in an adult is 100 µg/D (in kids, it’s 100 µg/m2/d, so it’s corrected by body area).          When starting hormone replacement therapy, it’s best to slowly ramp up the dosage to a therapeutic level, to let the patient’s body acclimatize.       Treatment of Hyperthyroidism  There are 3 possible treatment routes for hyperthyroidism:          Medication → drugs which diminish the synthesis and/or release of active thyroid hormone.      Radioactive Iodine Ablation → ablation of hyperactive thyroid cells using radioactive iodine.      Surgery → removal of the thyroid gland and thyroid hormone replacement.      Medication  Medications for hyperthyroidism aim to reduce synthesis or reduce release of thyroid hormone.  These include:          Thioamides → Methimazole, and Propylthiouracil.      Iodine → ironically, excess iodine anion can actually diminish thyroid function.                  This is known as the Wolff–Chaikoff effect → a reduction in thyroid hormone levels caused by ingestion of a large amount of iodine.                    Objectives: (1) List the drugs used in treating hyperthyroid conditions. (2) Describe the pharmacology, kinetics and mechanism of action of the thioamides and anionic inhibitors.Thioamides  Thioamides are used in several hyperthyroid conditions, including Graves’ disease, thyrotoxicosis, and toxic nodular goitres.  Examples include methimazole and propylthiouracil.  Mechanism of action:          Inhibits the incorporation of iodine into the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin.      Inhibits the coupling of MIT and DIT, which is needed to cleave T3/T4 from thyroglobulin.        Remember      Thioamides have 2 mechanisms of action:              They inhibit the incorporation of iodine onto thyroglobulin.        They inhibit the coupling of MIT and DIT, which is needed to cleave T3/T4 from thyroglobulin.              As a result, there is reduced hormone synthesis.  Treatment takes a while, because pre-existing stores of thyroid hormone must be depleted.  Thioamides used in Canada include:          Methimazole (MMI)                  Is much stronger than propylthiouracil.                    Propylthiouracil (PTU)                  Less potent, however it does have a diminished ability to cross the placenta versus MMI.          As a result, propylthiouracil is used during the first trimester of pregnancy, because of fears of potential teratogenic effects.                          PTU has a small risk of fulminant hepatitis, so this is basically the only time when it’s used.                                Additionally, PTU has a faster onset of action.                          This is because PTU has another function: it inhibits the D2 deiodinase which converts T4 to T3.              So it has a second effect of inhibiting T4 → T3 conversion.                                            Minor side-effects of thioamides include fever, and rashes. Rarer problems include cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, and arthralgia.  All thioamides carry the small risk of causing agranulocytosis (0.3-0.6% of patients).Objective: Describe the adverse effects associated with use of the drugs used in treating hyperthyroidism.  Comparison of Thioamides                             Methimazole        Propylthiouracil                            Strength        Strong        Weak (~10x less effective than MMI)                    Used in        First-line        Only in 1st trimester of pregnancy                    Onset of Action        Slower        Faster                    Serious (rare) Adverse Effects        Agranulocytosis        Agranulocytosis and Fulminant hepatitis            Objective: Describe the therapeutic uses of iodide and iodinated contrast media.Iodide  Counterintuitively, iodide (I-) itself has an antithyroid activity.  At pharmacological doses (ie. high doses), iodide inhibits organification reactions, and the release of hormones from the thyroid.          Organification = attaching elemental iodide to an organic moiety (eg. thyroglobulin).        In other words, if you have too much iodide, it can depress thyroid function.  Hence, the response to iodide can be variable → either hypo- or hyper-thyroidism can result.  iodide is often given as an adjunct to thioamides:          In this case, the thioamide must be given first. If you give the iodide first, it may result in an initial increase in thyroid hormone formation, which would exacerbate hyperthyroidism.      If iodide is used in treatment, you cannot use radioactive iodide therapy for several weeks. This is because it won’t be taken up by the thyroid with such a high pre-existing supply.        Prolonged iodide use is not suggested:          Using iodide for greater than 6-8 weeks introduces the risk of the thyroid ‘escaping’ from its inhibitory effects.      This can lead to severe thyrotoxicosis (the thyroid is now producing as much thyroid hormone as it wants), which can be life threatening.        Adverse Effects:          Collectively known as “iodism”, and may include fever, rash, mucous membrane ulcers, and, rarely, anaphylactoid reactions. Toxicity is uncommon.        iodide in Medications:          Some medications have substantial iodide content.      Antiseptics often contain iodide.      Amiodarone (which we saw in the Antiarrythmics lecture in Cardiology) has a huge amount of iodide (75 mg/tablet)!      Radio-contrast media also has a high iodide content.                  In fact, sometimes, contrast is used as an ‘unlabeled’ treatment for patients in a thyroid storm, since it’s a readily accessible source of iodide.                      We mentioned that the response to iodine can be both hypo- or hyper-thyroidism. This is characterized by the Wolff-Chaikoff Effect or the Jod-Basedow Phenomenon.  What is the “Wolff‐Chaikoff Effect”?          A physiological response where you decrease thyroid hormone production in the presence of an iodine load.      Normal people ‘escape’ the W‐C effect and then achieve a new steady state of Euthyroidism.      Those with underlying, subclinical Hashimoto’s may not escape, but will instead become hypothyroid.        What is the “Jod‐Basedow phenomenon”?          (Jod = Iodine, Basedow = German physician who described autoimmune hyperthyroidism ~ the same time as Graves did)      This is seen in patients with underlying autonomous thyroid tissue (toxic nodules) or mild subclinical Graves’.      Here, they do not experience Wolff‐Chaikoff, but instead their thyroid uses an iodine load to make too much hormone, causing hyperthyroidism.        Wolff-Chaikoff Effect vs. Jod-Basedow Phenomenon      Wolff-Chaikoff Effect = Hypothyroidism following an iodine load.    Jod-Basedow Phenomenon = Hyperthyroidism following an iodine load. Seen in patients with toxic nodules or mild Graves’.  Radioactive IodineObjective: Describe the therapeutic and diagnostic uses of radioactive iodine.  There are 2 isotopes of radioactive iodine that are used medically:          131I → used pharmacologically to treat hyperthyroidism.                  Long half life → 8 days. This means that 99% is expended within 56 days.          Radiation consists of both γ-rays and β-particles.                    123I → used diagnostically for radioactive iodine scans.                  Short half life → only 13 hours. This gives you a brief exposure to radiation, which is better suited for a diagnostic test.          Radiation consists of γ-rays only. This avoids the carcinogenicity of β-particles.                      In other words, we use a more ‘powerful’ isotope for treating hyperthyroidism, and a ‘weaker’ isotope for diagnostics.          With 131I, the idea is that the radioactive iodine will be taken up into the thyroid much like normal iodine. There, the β-particle can destroy follicular cells, controlling the hyperthyroidism.      With 123I, we use the fact that iodine will localize to thyroid tissue, and we use a less cytotoxic isotope.        Comparison of 131I and 123I                             131I        123I                            Used for        Treating Hyperthyroidism        Radioactive Iodine Scans                    Emits        β-particles and γ-rays        γ-rays only                    Half life        Long (8 days)        Short (13 hours)            «span class=”sidenote”&gt;Describe the adverse effects associated with the use of iodine and iodinated compounds.&lt;/span&gt;  Side Effects of Radioactive Iodine:          The primary concern is the high incidence of delayed hypothyroidism.      In other words, we often overtreat the patient → instead of bringing them to a euthyroid condition, we veer too far.      Nowadays, some clinicians actually aim to overtreat → that is, they aim for hypothyroidism instead of a euthyroid condition.                  This is because it’s easier to treat hypothyroidism (with hormone replacement therapy), than it is to treat hyperthyroidism.          It’s better to overdo the treatment than to underdo it!                    Thyroiditis is also a concern.        Other ‘minor’ inconveniences include the fact that you have to avoid pregnant women, close contact, breast-feeding, and borders until your treatment is complete.Thyroid Toxicology  From this point on we will NOT be dealing with drugs currently used in treating hypo/hyperthyroidism.  We WILL be dealing with some relevant Toxicology, namely the antithyroidal effects of several ions.  Some ions are used in industrial processes and exposure of industrial workers may be a problem.Anions with Anti-thyroid Effects  Anions with anti-thyroid effects include:          Thiocyanate (SCN-)      Perchlorate (ClO4-)      Other anions (fluoroborate, fluorosulfonate, difluorophosphate, pertechnate, nitrate, and bromide).        These anions all have a similar hydrated radius to the iodine anion.          Hydrated radius = the radius of the anion when surrounded by water dipoles.        The idea here is that, since these anions have a similar shape to the iodine ion, they can compete with iodide for transport into the thyroid.          Perchlorate is about 10 times more active than thiocyanate, so it’s particularly important.        Why don’t they use these anions to treat hyperthyroidism?          Really bad side effects → perchlorate has been used, but it can cause fatal aplastic anemia with high doses.      It has been used to treat Graves’ disease and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in small doses though.        Lithium can decrease secretion of T4 and T3.          Unlike the anions described above, lithium inhibits export, not import.      Lithium is used in psychiatry.      Foods with Anti-thyroid Effects  Turnips and Cruciferous Plants (Cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts)          Due to the presence of a compound called goitrin, which resembles the thioamides (Methimazole, Propylthiouracil).      Goitrin is about as active as PTU in humans. In addition, humans that drink the milk from cattle that feed on kale will also end up with hypothyroidism, because the cows will concentrate the goitrin.      This isn’t really much of a problem in humans, since it’s difficult to ingest enough cabbage to induce hypothyroidism.      However, rabbits fed on cabbage leaves will develop goiters.        Cassava          A staple food in Africa, this plant contains compounds which can liberate cyanide and thiocyanate if not properly prepared.      We just saw that thiocyanate has an anti-thyroidal effect because it has a similar hydrated radius to that of iodide.      To resolve this, you have to pound the cassava before eating it → this breaks open cells, releasing enzymes that break down the thiocyanate.

	{"title": "Thyroid Physiology", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Define the role of thyroglobulin in thyroid function.  Explain the mechanism and regulation of thyroid hormone formation and the role of pituitary TSH.  Discuss the factors regulating thyroid hormone levels (binding proteins, deiodinases, clearance, etc.).  Explain the cellular mechanism of action of thyroid hormone.  Define the physiological role of thyroid hormones in development and the adult including the major effects on cellular metabolism.  Illustrate the physiological basis of thyroid pathology.

List the influences which alter the binding of thyroid hormones to transport proteins.  Describe the actions of the active thyroid hormones and the consequences of hypo or hyper secretion.Functional Anatomy of the Thyroid  The largest endocrine organ.  Composed of follicular cells surrounding a thyroid follicle.          Envision this as a bunch of houses surrounding a common backyard.      Inside the thyroid follicle (the backyard), in the follicular lumen, is a substance called colloid.      Colloid → reservoir of materials for thyroid hormone production, particularly thyroglobulin (Tg).      Thyroglobulin is used to synthesize thyroid hormone.      Objective: Define the role of thyroglobulin in thyroid function  Thyroglobulin:          High molecular weight (660 KD).      Has a lot of tyrosine residues (~330) → these are important for producing T3 and T4, since T3 and T4 are tyrosine derivatives.      Production of Thyroid Hormone  HPT Axis = hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid.  Above is a parafollicular cell in the thyroid gland, which makes thyroid hormone.  One key ingredient for thyroid hormone is iodine.          However, iodine needs to get into the colloid, where thyroglobulin exists, to make T3 and T4.      How is this possible, with a low environmental availability of iodine?        We use something called the iodine trap:          NIS → a sodium (Na) iodine (I) symporter (S), which uses a Na+ gradient (generated actively) to transport I- into the thyroid cell.      Pendrin transports I- into lumen for oxidative coupling&lt;/i&gt; to thyroglobulin.        The Iodine Trap      Iodine is brought into the thyroid follicle via 2 steps:              To get in to the parafollicular cells, I- import is coupled with an Na+ gradient by NIS, a sodium iodine symporter.        To get out to the thyroid follicle, I- export is mediated by Pendrin.              Now that iodine has been moved from the basolateral side → parafollicular cell → colloid, it can be used to produce T3 and T4.          This is mediated by TPO → thyroid peroxidase.      TPO has 2 functions:                  It iodinates the tyrosine residues on Thyroglobulin.          It couples tyrosine residues, to create T3 and T4.                    Objective: Describe the molecular structure of the active thyroid hormones  Iodination:          The tyrosine residue can either be iodinated once to form monoiodotyrosine, or twice to form diiodotyrosine.        Coupling:          Monoiodotyrosine + diiodotyrosine = triiodotyrosine (T3).      Diiodotyrosine + diiodotyrosine = thyroxine (T4).        Remember      Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) is what iodinates Tg, and couples it to create T3 and T4.    T3 &amp; T4 are still attached to Thyroglobulin at this point, as modified tyrosine residues. They have to be chopped off to release the active hormones:          The Tg-T3/T4 complex is brought back into the cell by pinocytosis.      In the cell, iodinated Tg is proteolytically processed by MIT and DIT.      T3 and T4 can now freely exit the thyroid cell into the general circulation.      Objective: Describe the synthesis of active thyroid hormones in the thyroid gland.  Summary of Thyroid Hormone Production      Iodine is first brought into the thyroid cell on the basolateral side by NIS.    Iodine is then brought out of the thyroid cell on the apical side by Pendrin.    Now in the colloid, the I- can then be coupled to thyroglobulin to create a Tg-T3/T4 complex. This is mediated by TPO.    Tg-T3/T4 is then imported back into the thyroid cell via pinocytosis.    Tg-T3/T4 is then cleaved by proteases in the thyroid cell called MIT and DIT.    Free T3/T4 then exits the thyroid cell into the general circulation.    TSH can stimulate this process:          It increases NIS activity (import at the basolateral side).      It increases production of Tg in the colloid.      It increases TPO activity (iodination/coupling).      Thyroid Hormone TransportObjective: Describe the transport of thyroid hormones in the plasma.  Since the thyroid hormones are amino acid derivatives, they’re not water loving, and are lipid soluble (just like with steroid hormones).  Hence, to travel through the plasma, they need a carrier protein.  Thyroid Hormone carrier proteins:          Thyroxine Binding Globulin (TBG)                  The major carrier protein, high affinity.          Binds 75% of circulating T3 and T4.                    Transthyretin (TTR)                  Less affinity than TTG.          20% of circulating T4, 5% of circulating T3.                    Human Serum Albumin (HSA)                  Low affinity.          5% of circulating T4, 20% of circulating T3.                    Obejective: Discuss the factors regulating thyroid hormone levels (binding proteins, deiodinases, clearance, etc.)  These binding proteins regulate the bio-availability and half life of T3/T4.  Without them, thyroid hormones are rapidly cleared from circulation.Differentiating T3 and T4  What’s the difference between T3 and T4?          T3 is secreted less, is 10x more potent, and has a much shorter half life.      T4 is secreted more, is less potent, and has a much longer half life.      T3 functions as the active form of thyroid hormone, so it’s converted from T4 in destination tissues.        Conversion of T4→T3 is carried out by cell specific deiodinases (D1-D4).          The relative ratio of activity between these deiodinases will determine the strength of the signal at the end destination.      This conversion occurs in the target tissues of thyroid hormone.        T3 vs T4                             T3        T4                            % of hormone secreted        10%        90%                    % free in plasma        1%        0.1%                    Relative activity (potency)        10        1                    Half-life (days)        1        7            Thyroid Hormone ActionObjective: Discuss the factors regulating thyroid hormone levels (binding proteins, deiodinases, clearance, etc.)  Thyroid hormones can be modified at the destination tissue to increase or decrease signal strength:          If there’s not enough T3 in the end destination, T4 → T3.      If there’s too much active T3, then (1) T4 → rT3 or (2) T3 → T2.                  rT3 is reverse T3, which is an inactive form of T3.          By converting T4 to an inactive T3, we prevent an excessively strong downstream signal.          Similarly, T2 is also less active, so we accomplish the same thing.                    Note that D3 is involved in both the conversion of T4 → rT3 and T3 → T2.  Different deiodinases are involved in different conversions:          T4 is converted to T3 by D2.      T4 is converted to rT3 by D3.      T3 is converted to T2 by D3.      Objective: Explain the cellular mechanism of action of thyroid hormone.  Active T3 can pass through into the nucleus, where it can bind to TR (thyroid receptor), a nuclear receptor that functions like a transcription factor.  This results in the upregulation of genes that lead to the effects of thyroid hormone.Role of Thyroid HormonesObjective: Define the physiological role of thyroid hormones in development and the adult including the major effects on cellular metabolism  What do thyroid hormones do?  Early Growth &amp; Development:          Required for GH secretion and action.      Essential for early neural development (via induction of NGF → neural growth factor).      Hence, a maternal lack of T3/T4 results in growth retardation and cretinism.        In General:          Increases mitochondrial growth and activity:                  Therefore, it increases your basal metabolic activity.          Results in increased heat production, oxygen demand, HR, and SV.                    Stimulates Na+/K+ ATPase Activity:                  Specifically in the heart, increasing cardiac metabolic demand.                    Increases transcription of energy metabolism enzymes.                  Increased lipolysis (less fat), glycolysis (less glycogen), and gluconeogenesis (more glucose) results in more readily usable energy sources.                    Necessary for the induction of PRL (prolactin), GH (growth hormone), surfactant (in your lungs), and NGF (neural growth factor).                  So aberrant thyroid hormone levels impact growth, lung function, and the nervous system.                      Thyroid hormones acts on the order of hours, days, to weeks. They have long lasting effects.  Therefore, to treat thyroid disorders, it’ll take a long time.Thyroid DiseasesChronic Iodine Deficiency  There are endemic deficiencies of thyroid hormones (T3, T4) in different parts of the world, due to a dietary deficiency in iodine.          We also used to have that in Canada, but now, because we have fortified our salts with iodine, we no longer have an issue.      Objective: Illustrate the physiological basis of thyroid pathology  Chronic low iodine can result in an endemic goiter → enlargement of the thyroid gland.          This is because we don’t have the iodine necessary to make normal T3 and T4, so we have high levels of TSH, without any negative feedback.      Excessive TSH stimulation over time needs to hypertrophy of thryoid cells, resulting in a goiter.      Treated by reintroducing iodine, or IV T3/T4.      Objective: Describe the actions of the active thyroid hormones and the consequences of hypo or hyper secretionHypothyroidism  Symptoms include lack of energy, slow heart rate, muscle cramping, lack of concentration, poor memory, puffy eyelids, and feeling odd.Feeling odd.  Most common cause is Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis.Hashimoto’s Disease  Auto-immune disease which results in hypothyroidism.  Antibodies against TPO, thyroid peroxidase.          Recall that TPO was what iodinated thyroglobulin.        As a result, we have less T3/T4.Hyperthyroidism  Symptoms include feeling hot, increased sweating, a fast/strong/irregular heart-beat, nervousness, and trembling hands.  Most common cause is Graves’ Disease.Graves’ Disease  Auto-immune disease which results in hyperthyroidism.  Here, anti-TSH receptor antibodies bind to the receptor.  Binding of these antibodies to the TSH receptor leaves them ‘constitutively’ active, leading to unbounded T3/T4 production.Calcitonin  A third, less known, thyroid hormone.  Demonstrated to play a big role in inhibiting osteoclast activity long term, reducing bone breakdown.          Opposes the effect of PTH produced in the parathyroids.      Secreted by parafollicular cells (clear cells) which are adjacent to the follicular cells, and are of a different embryological origin from the follicular cells.        Has been shown to be important in fish, however studies in humans have been more mixed.          In patients with total thyroidectomies, where there is no calcitonin production, calcitonin replacement doesn’t seem to be necessary.        However, it is important to know that it is upregulated in medullary carcinoma.          We saw this last year as one possible thyroid screening test, in the Thyroid lecture.

If you have too much of the hormone, we try to suppress it.      Basics of EndocrinologyLecture Objectives  List the hormones produced by the pituitary gland.  Describe a hypothalamic-pituitary-end organ feedback loop.  Complete a grid of pituitary hormones and the effect of overproduction and underproduction of these hormones.The Endocrine System  The pituitary gland is basically the master regulator of a number of endocrine organs.          However, the pituitary gland itself is regulated by the hypothalamus.      There are negative feedback loops that keep hormone release under control.        There are a lot of interactions → things can get confusing.  Try to simplify things to the following:          What does the hormone do?      What happens when a hormone is under-produced?      What happens when a tumour is over-produced?      Modules  Thyroid Gland.          Hypothalamus released TRH → Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone.      TRH stimulates the Pituitary gland to produce TSH → Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.      This stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4 hormones.        Parathyroid Glands          Release of Parathyroid hormone in response to Calcium levels.      This actually isn’t regulated centrally by the hypothalamus, feedback it managed locally by the parathyroid glands themselves.        Adrenal Glands          CRH is released by the Hypothalamus.      This stimulates ACTH release by the Pituitary Gland.      ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, mineralicorticoids, glucocorticoids, etc.        Pituitary Gland, Growth &amp; Growth Hormone, Sexual Development &amp; Puberty          The reproduction component is left until the Reproduction block.      Looking at growth and growth hormone feedback loops.        Diabetes          Again, the pancreas has a feedback loop that doesn’t involve the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.      Diabetes involves a loss of insulin producing cells, or a loss of sensitivity to insulin.
