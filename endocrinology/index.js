	{"title": "T1DM Focal Cases", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary  A 9-year-old girl with Type 1 Diabetes for 3 years is on an insulin regimen of Novorapid 8 units and NPH 12 units before breakfast; Novorapid 6 units before supper and NPH 8 units at bedtime. She has consistently high blood glucose levels in the range of 12 – 20 mmol/l before breakfast with some ketones present in the urine before breakfast. The rest of the day her blood sugars are all around 4-7 mmol/l and her ketones are negative.   Novorapid (Insulin Aspart) is a short-acting insulin.          Onset → 10 minutes.      Lasts → 2 hours.        NPH is an intermediate-acting insulin.          Onset → 4 hours.      Lasts → 8 hours.        Lantus (Glargine) is a long-acting insulin.          Onset → a few hours.      Lasts → 24 hours.      Questions  Describe the 2 most likely causes of her high morning sugars?          Dawn Phenomenon → cortisol is higher in the morning, raising sugars. Here, it’s because her NPH at bedtime is too low to account for the dawn phenomenon.      Somogyi Phenomenon → rebound hyperglycemia after you have hypoglycemia overnight. Here, it’s because her NPH at bedtime is too high overnight, causing her glucose to rebound in the morning.        What questions about symptoms would you ask to help you determine which of these 2 events is occuring?          These two phenomena have the opposite etiology, so you have to come up with differentiating factors to decide your diagnosis.      If she’s hypoglycemia overnight, she may have nocturia, diaphoresis, disorientation, nightmares, headaches in the morning.        What would you advise her to do if doubts still exist as to the cause?          Check her sugars overnight.      If her sugars are low, then it’s the Somogyi Phenomenon; otherwise, it’s the Dawn Phenomenon.        What changes would you recommend to her insulin regimen?          Depends on what the etiology is:                  Dawn Phenomenon → raise her bedtime NPH.          Somogyi Phenomenon → drop her bedtime NPH.                      Remember      The two most common causes for high morning sugars are:              Dawn Phenomenon → cortisol is high in the morning, which can raise morning glucose. Due to her night-time insulin being insufficient.        Somogyi Phenomenon → rebound hyperglycemia after you have overnight hypoglycemia. Due to her night-time insulin being excessive.            Case #2  Case Summary  A 15-year-old girl is a picky eater. She was diagnosed with T1DM at age 8 and is currently on an insulin pump of rapid-acting insulin with increasing administration at mealtimes. Since starting high school her mother has noticed she has been skipping lunch and she also doesn’t like to check her glucose levels at school in front of her friends. She has been having hypoglycemic spells 3 to 4 times a week due to not completing her meals. Her A1c today is 9.8%.  Here, the patient clearly has poor control; HbA1c &gt; 7.   She also has phases where she goes hypoglycemic, because she isn’t finishing the meals that correspond to her insulin boluses.Questions  How does an insulin pump work? What are its advantages over MDI?          Subcutaneous cathether inserted.      Basal infusion of insulin over the day.      When you’re eating a meal, you input the carbohydrate value into the pump, and it’ll deliver a catered insulin bolus.      Advantages of a pump over Multiple Daily Injection (MDI):                  Less disruption to lifestyle → no need for needles.          More flexibility over what you eat.          Better control over blood glucose.                    Diadvantages of an Insulin Pump:                  You have to carry it around with you.          The pump is more expensive → although Ontario does pay for the pump, and subsidize the cost of supplies.                      What are some reasons for poor glycemic control in adolescents?          Peer pressure → embarrassed about checking her glucose levels in front of friends.      Rebellion, resistance to authority.      Adolescents think they’re invincible.      Puberty increases insulin resistance due to hormonal changes.      Patients may have body image issues, changing their diet.        What options are available to prevent hypoglycemia in this teenager?          Adjusting dosing to avoid hypoglycemia. It might seem logical, but some patients don’t think of it.      Counselling, patient education.        List three rescue options for hypoglycemia.          Glucose Gel → good for patients with gastric emptying because you can hold it in your mouth where it can be absorbed.      Glucagon Kit → solution with a powder that is mixed and injected. When you prescribe it, a pharmacist will teach the patient (and their family) how to administer it.      Glucose tablets → or just some candy or another readily available source of glucose.        Our patient wants to start driving as soon as she turns 16. How would you counsel her?          She needs to manage her hypoglycemic spells.      Her glucose needs to be over 5 to drive.                  If it’s less than 5, take some carbohydrates.          Re-measure glucose level in 15 minutes.          You actually have to wait 1 hour after glucose has normalized before you can drive.                    Tell her that if she gets into a car accident due to her low sugars, then it could harm not only herself, but also others.      Case #3  Case Summary  Mr. Bruce Holt is a 37-year-old man who has had Type 1 diabetes for 27 years. His current insulin regime is 5 units Novorapid and 22 units NPH at breakfast, 7 units Novorapid at supper and 15 units NPH at bedtime. He is doing blood glucose testing 3-4 times daily and has very variable control with values ranging from 2 to over 20 mmol/l.His HbA1C value is 11.0%. Questions  What does the HbA1C value indicate and what is the optimal target range for this man?          HbA1C reflects long-term blood sugar levels, so a high level indicates poor compliance.      It’s actually weighted towards more recent blood sugar levels.      The optimal target range is &lt;7%.        List 3 changes to his insulin regime aimed at optimizing his glycemic control.          Patient is taking both fast-acting and long-acting insulin at breakfast.      Patient is not taking anything at lunch.      This technically isn’t a MDI regimen → an MDI regimen consists of 4 injections/day, with short-acting injections before meals, and long-acting injections before bedtime.      Some possible changes:                  Patient could consider going on an MDI regimen.          Patient could consider switching to an insulin pump.          Could implement an insulin:carbohydrate ratio to dose-adjust their insulin level.                      What characteristics would indicate that an insulin pump would be beneficial for Mr. Holt?          He has Type 1 diabetes, so it’ll be subsidized in Ontario.      He has suboptimal glucose control.      He has a lot of variability in his glucose levels → an insulin pump has finer control.      Case #4  Case Summary  An 11-year-old boy presents with polyuria and polydipsia. A random blood glucose is 25.4 mmol/l. Urine is negative for ketones but 3+ for glucose Questions  List and describe 3 demographic factors that may help distinguish Type 1 from Type 2 diabetes.           Age → it’s more likely to be Type 1 if &lt;9, and more likely to be Type 2 in older patients. It does get a bit murkier in older patients; it’s actually possible to be Type 1 in a patient that’s 40.      Ethnicity → First Nations, African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, are at higher risk of Type 2 Diabetes.      Family History → T2DM is more strongly genetically linked.        List and describe 2 clinical features which may help distinguish Type 1 from Type 2 diabetes.          BMI → BMI in the 85th %ile or higher, makes it more likely to be Type II.      Skin Changes → Acanthosis nigricans is a marker of hyperinsulinemia as a result of insulin resistance. Hence, it’s more suggestive of T2DM.        What lab tests can we use to help differentiate T1DM and T2DM?          Anti-islet cells Antibodies.       Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA).                  These are also targets of auto-antibodies in patients who develop T1DM.                    C-peptide Levels                  C-peptide is part of the insulin protein, so this is a marker of endogenous insulin protein.          If this is low, it’s more suggestive of T1DM.                    Case #5The last part of this small group session is designed to give you the opportunity to test your skills at insulin dose adjustments. You are provided with blood glucose records for two patients. What insulin dose adjustments would you recommend for each patient?   Patient #1      8 y/o boy with T1DM, HbA1c = 8.4%.    Current insulin regimen is as follows:    					Breakfast		Lunch		Supper		Bedtime				Blood Glucose		NR		NPH				NR		NPH				&lt;4 mmol/L		3		16				2		8				4-8		4						3						8-12		5						4						12-16		6						5						16-20		7						6						&gt;20		8						7			      Blood glucose levels over the past week:                               Breakfast        Lunch        Supper        Bedtime                            Mon        4.2        6.8        12.3        16.7                    Tues        3.9        12.5        14.6        18.2                    Wed        6.8        8.5        9.2        12.6                    Thurs        3.2        6.9        8.5        4.7                    Fri        4.1        5.2        11.9        16.5                    Sat        2.8        11.4        13.4        8.4                    Sun        3.9        9.4        14.3        15.9            Adjustments  The patient is on a sliding scale for Novorapid based on his glucose levels. He is on no NR at lunch, and he’s on NPH at bedtime.  Is the patient having any lows?          Yes, especially at the mornings.      Hence, we should reduce the bedtime NPH (we usually drop things by 10%).        Is the patient having any highs?          Yes; their glucose levels before supper.                  We probably can’t give them insulin at lunch because this is a 8-year old child who receives insulin from his parents.          So instead, we can increase their NPH at breakfast.                    Their glucose is also high at bedtime.                  Increase supper dose of NR by around 10%.                      Patient #2      15 y/o girl with T1DM; HbA1c = 7.1%.

Glargine) at night, and rapid-acting insulin before each meal.  Is the patient having any lows?          At supper → also note that she’s consistently dropping from lunch to supper. So drop her lunch dose by 10%.      At lunch → drop her breakfast NR by 10%.        Is the patient having any highs?          At breakfast → treatment depends on whether it’s the Dawn phenomenon or the Somogyi phenomenon. Increase or decrease the Lantus depending on the cause.      At bedtime → increase her supper NR by 10% (18-23, so by 2 units).        Note      Whenever we’re adjusting a patient’s insulin, we always adjust up/down by around 10%!

Describe effective methods of preventing Type 2 diabetes.  Differentiate issues of diabetes prevention as they apply to individuals and populations.Primary Prevention  Recall that there are 3 types of prevention in medicine:          Primary → the disease never happens.      Secondary → the disease is stopped or prevented from becoming worse.      Tertiary → the chronic complications of disease are prevented from getting worse.        Today, we’ll be focusing on primary prevention.Primary Prevention of Type 1 DiabetesTYPE 1 DIABETS.What has been tried and failed• Nicotinamide• Immunization with low dose insulin s/c • Oral insulin• Cow’s milk study in infants still going on (called Trigr)	- Homology for ab for cows milk and ab for islets cells.	- So if you get cows milk too soon, you can set up an Ab response, triggering beta cells.	- Trial is still 10 years down.	- Preliminary results look ugly.- Study in early 80s with ciclosporine.	- In patients in honeymoon period of T1DM, still some islet cells working.	- They prolonged the honeymoon!	- The problem was that patients got lymphomas from the anti-rejection drugs.	- So the negatives outweighed the benefits.SO WE STILL HAVE NOTHING GOOD.Primary Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes• Wasn’t thought possible• However, last few years have seen great and fascinating studiesWhy do we care?! Lifetime risk of developing diabetes (type 1 or type 2) for individuals born in 2000◦ Male = 33% and Female = 39%!

	{"title": "Therapy for T2DM", "text": "  T2DM Therapy Notes      See T2DM Therapy Notes.  Lecture Objectives  Identify effective lifestyle treatments for Type 2 diabetes.  Identify the major medications used to treat hyperglycemia.  Integrate medication interventions for Type 2 DM that are additional to glucose lowering options.Treatment Goals  You want to help your patient with diabetes:          Feel well day-to-day (immediate goal).                  This is the absence of thirst, polyuria, fatigue, yeast infections, blurred vision, pruritus (these are the acute effects of hyperglycemia).                    Feel well as long as possible (prevention goal).                  This is the avoidance of the chronic complications of DM.                    Treatment Challenges  Patients with T2DM don’t only have hyperglycemia; they also have a body chemistry that gives them a multitude of cardiovascular risks.  Diabetes is a chronic disease; successful treatment requires the patient to ‘buy-in’.  There are many challenges to meeting their goals:          Inertia and resistance → it’s hard to change your habits.      Financial costs → medications cost money.      Guilt → try to avoid guilt tripping your patients.      Treatment Toolkit  Lifestyle for everything → by far the most important; medications can only do so much.  Patient Education for everyone.  Medications for glucose.  Medications for lipids, BP, complications.Diet  High carbohydrate, low fat, high fibre.  Three meals a day and snacks.  Important collaboration with DM dietitians.  We try to match the diet to what the pancreas can make; if we can’t get things to match, we use medication to help.Lifestyle  Regular meals.  Regular exercise (“exercise is medicine”).  Diabetes thrives on boring routines.  Weight control → patients may not need medications, even if they lose a little bit of weight.  Ideal patient should be medically literate.Patient Education  There are specific Registered Dietitians certified for Diabetes → RD (CDE).  There are also specific Registered Nurses for Diabetes → RN (CDE).  Physicians.  The patient plays a critical role as well → especially in monitoring their own blood glucose.Medications for Glucose Control  These are separated into two major categories:          Insulin secretagogues → chemicals that make your pancreas produce more insulin.      Insulin sensitizers → chemicals that make your body respond better to insulin.        Categories of Glucose Medications      Insulin secretagogues → chemicals that make your pancreas produce more insulin.    Insulin sensitizers → chemicals that make your body respond better to insulin.  DPP4 inhibitors, incretin mimics: Chemicals that boost your internal incretin response• SGLT inhibitors: Chemicals that increase glucose excretion in renal tubules	- Just came out in June.! Chemicals that give you gas (alpha- glucosidase inhibitors)—well actually, things that inhibit the absorption of glucose from the GI tract	- No one orders them anyway, it’s hard to get on them w/o uncomfortable bowel gas, and they’re less effective anyway.- GLITAZONES!? also makes you gain weight- DPP4s are much better; don’t make you gain weight.Insulin  There are many many forms, but don’t panic.  To put things succinctly, insulin comes in two basic forms:          Fast Acting.      Longer Acting.        The insulin that Banting &amp; Best originally made is now called regular insulin → in Ontario, it’s also known as ‘Toronto’ insulin.          Starts in about 1/2 an hour.      Lasts about 4 hours.        Later on, longer acting insulins were developed from Regular by adding chemicals to make a depot preparation.          Example → NPH (neutral protamine Hagadorn).      Onsets → in about 4 hours.      Lasts → about 8 hours.        Some newest insulins include:          Fast Acting → Lispro, aka. Humalog, or Insulin Aspart.                  Onset in 10 minutes, last 2 hours.          More convenient, because patients can pop a pill right before they started eating.                    Long Acting → Glargine or Detemir.                  Onset in a few hours, lasts 24 hours.          Convenient because you can pop 1 pill, and make it last a day.          Has less of a ‘peak’, so it’s less likely to make you hypoglycemic.                    					Fast-acting		Long-acting				Examples									Lispro, aka. Humalog.				Insulin Aspart.														Glargine.				Detemir.									Onset &amp; Duration									Onset in 10 minutes.				Lasts 2 hours.														Onset in a few hours.				Lasts 24 hours.						SA at each meal, LA at bedtime.Typically SA assoc. with meals, LA overnight.Detemir more expensive, NPH a third of the cost.So if no drug plan, go for that.Pre-mixesMixes of regular and NPH are stable, so you don’t have to do the mixing.Principles of treating hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetes:1. Almost all hypoglycemic medications can be combined2. As time goes on, most people need more medications for glucose controlNo real wrong answer unless your liver and kidneys are not healthy.You can combine anything.T2DM is progressive, you have to increase strength of medication.TRY TO GET HBA1C LESS THAN 7METFORMIN(NOT A DIET PILL. As long as your kidneys and liver works. Start slow, titrate to max dosage, to avoid GI upset and diarrhea.)Sulfonylurea and/or DPP-4Secretagogue, so you’re at risk of going low.So bring some candy/juice/chocolate with them.‘Don’t worry, I’ve got lots of juice in the fridge’‘What about if you’re up stairs’‘You’ll be shaking, mood chanrges, hard to get down to drink it’Bring something portable with you all the time.  LA -&gt; NPH if no drug plan  Glargine or Detamir is drug plan.  Worry about metformin with kidney failure.          Not that metformin kills kidney.      Few cases of lactic acidosis have been seen in patients pregnant with impairment.      Also makes insulin last longer, so Lantus and exosgeneous insulin will be long acting!?!?!??!? Cirrhotic liver with no glycogen        More risk of hypoglycemia.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/endocrinology/2014/10/29/therapy-t2dm.html"},

Identify underlying pathophysiologic changes associated with Type 2 diabetes.  Define the glucose values that diagnose diabetes.  Type 2 DM is impossible to avoid as a physician.  It exemplifies interactions between (1) genetics, (2) insulin resistance and (3) environment that we have been considering.Introduction to DiabetesDefinition  Diabetes can be diagnosed with any of the following:          Random blood glucose of ≥ 11.1 mM with hyperglycemic symptoms:      Fasting blood glucose of ≥ 7 mM with hyperglycemic symptoms.      Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OCTT) with 2 hour BG ≥11.1 mM      HbA1C ≥ 6.5% → used to be 7% (literally last year), now 6.5%.                  This is a new criteria, and it’s only applicable in adults, and not the pediatric population.                      Some hyperglycemic symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, etc.  You need 2 positive findings, either:          Two different positive tests.      Two positives for the same test.        You can’t do these tests when the patient is under stress (ie, when they’re sick.)  Also, as a practical matter, it’s important to let your patients get insurance before you diagnose them, otherwise they’re irrevocably fucked!

Two positives for the same test.              These numbers were based on studies looking at the the presence/absence of diabetic retinopathy.  That’s because that’s an easily assessible sign, unlike something like vascular damage.  The graph on the right shows that the onset of diabetic retinopathy is around an HbA1C of 6.5%.Here’s an aside about a couple of oddities:DON’T MEMORIZE THESE NUMBERS, THEY KEEP CHANGING.1.

Expected osmolality              .        ‘Two salts and a sugar bun’.        If there’s a large gap between the expected osmolality and the measured osmolality, then it’s more suggestive of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning.              Serum Sodium Correction              Increased plasma glucose affects serum sodium levels because it draws out water into the ECF.        Recall that this was pseudohyponatremia.        To compensate for this, you correct the serum sodium by adding 1.6 mmol/L for every 5 mmol/L ↑ in glucose above 5.        So if the glucose is 30, increase the ‘true’ Na+ by 1.6 × 5, or 8 mmol/L.            Introduction  DKA → Diabetes Ketoacidosis.  HHS → Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State.  Both DKA and HHS are diabetic emergencies.  They are two extremes in the spectrum of hyperglycemia.          DKA is usually a T1DM phenomenon.      HHS is usually a T2DM phenomenon.      However, there is overlap between the two.        The fundamental difference between the two is that DKA arises from an absolute insulin deficiency, while HHS arises from a relative insulin deficiency.  Diabetic Ketoacidosis          High blood glucose.      High anion gap acidosis.      Ketonemia.        Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)          Very high BG/serum osmolality.      Minimal or no ketoacid accumulation.      Neurologic Abnormalities.        Neurologic abnormalities are seen more in HHS because the higher osmolality pulls more water out of the brain.  DKA vs HHS                             Diabetic Ketoacidosis        Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State                            Typically Seen in        T1DM        T2DM                    Glucose Levels        ↑        ↑↑↑                    Osmolality        ↑        ↑↑↑                    Ketones        Present        Absent                    Other Features        AGMA        Neurologic Abnormalities                    Mortality        Lower (&lt;5%)        Higher (~15%, due to neuro Sx)            Diabetic Ketoacidosis  DKA → Diabetes Ketoacidosis.  The most serious metabolic complication of T1DM.  Insufficient circulating insulin and excess counter-regulatory hormones.  Leads to an overproduction of ketone bodies and an anion gap Metabolic Acidosis.  Although it’s more common in T1DM, it’s not pathognomonic of T1DM.          This can also occur in T2DM, because a particularly high glucose level can be toxic to β-cells.      High catecholamines may also suppress insulin release.        Generally has a lower mortality rate than HHS, due to the absence of neurologic symptoms.Pathogenesis  This should be review.  Recall that:          Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis, glycogenesis, increases peripheral glucose uptake, and inhibits glucagon secretion.      Glucagon has the opposite effects.        Hence, with low insulin, glucagon is less inhibited, resulting in less glucose storage and more plasma glucose → hyperglycemia.  Insulin also stimulates GLUT-4 mediated uptake of glucose into tissues, so without insulin, you can’t utilize your glucose.          Ketones are then used as an alternate source of energy → oxidized for ATP.        Ketogenesis occurs as follows:          Decreased insulin leads to increased fat lipolysis.      This results in increased Free Fatty Acids.      These FFAs are converted to ketones in the liver.      Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State  HHS → Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State.  Less common, on a continuum with DKA (since they differ in their relative levels of insulin).  Here, the insulin level is too low to utilize glucose, but high enough to restrain lipolysis and ketogenesis:          The insulin level is too low to utilize glucose, so you end up with glycosuria, osmotic diuresis, H2O loss, and an increase in electrolyte concentration.      The insulin level is high enough to restrain lipolysis &amp; ketogenesis. Since we don’t have lipolysis, we don’t have the increase in free fatty acids. As a result, we don’t have ketone synthesis.        Hence, they key differentiating feature is the absence of ketones.  Another key differentiating feature is the presence of neurological complications → seizures, stroke.          As mentioned before, this is due to the fact that the osmolarity is higher in HHS, meaning that more water is drawn out of the brain.      Precipitating Factors  Below are some precipitating factors for acute complications of diabetes.  A good way to remember these are things that start with I:          Insufficient Insulin (new onset, inadequate education, insulin pumps, eating disorders, fear of hypoglycemia, rebellion)      Infection      Infarction (stroke, MI)      Intoxication (alcohol)      Iatrogenic (drugs: steroids, thiazides, sympathomimetics)      Injury (trauma)      Inflammation (pancreatitis)      Clinical Presentation  Split these into symptoms based on (1) hyperglycemia, (2) neurologic complications, and (3) metabolic acidosis.  Hyperglycemia:          Low insulin → increased plasma glucose.      Results in polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss.        Neurologic Complications:          Due to increased osmolality (especially in HHS), drawing water from the brain.      Presents with lethargy, focal signs, obtundatation (decreased level of consciousness), seizures, coma.        Acidosis          Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, delayed gastric emptying.      Kussmaul’s breathing due to compensatory respiratory alkalosis.        In DKA, you can sometimes smell acetone in the patient’s breath.          Will smell fruity, or like nail polish.      Clinical Approach  History &amp; Physical Exam:          ABCs → these patients are usually acutely sick.      Mental status → neurologic symptoms are suggestive of HHS.      Cardiovascular, renal status → especially urine output to assess polyuria.      Precipitants → are they sick.      Hydration → are they drinking to compensate for their fluid losses?        Lab Evaluation:          Blood gases.      Electrolytes, plsama glucose, BUN, creatinine.      Serum &amp; urine ketones.      Urinalysis.      CBC, EKG.        Depending on the history, consider cardiac enzymes, blood/urine cultures, CXR, etc.Measuring Ketones  There are two methods for measuring ketones:          Serum βOH butyrate → looks for βOH butyrate.      Urine Dipstick Test → looks for acetoacetate/acetone only, but not βOH butyrate.        Importantly, βOH butyrate is the predominant ketone in DKA.  Over time, it gets metabolized into acetoacetate and acetone.  Hence, since the urine dipstick measures a metabolite, there’s a lag time between urine dipstick values and ‘true’ serum ketones. Which means that:          Urine ketones may be negative early in DKA.      Urine ketones may remain positive early in treatment.        Then why not always use the serum βOH butyrate?          It’s not available at all labs.      But if you’re in a large tertiary care centre, this is the best choice.        Tests for Ketones                             Serum βOH Butyrate        Urine Dipstick                            Measures        Serum βOH Butyrate        Urine acetoacetate/acetone                    Time Lag?        None        Delay between change in true ketones and lab test                    Availability        Only in some labs        Everywhere            Treatment  Fluid → restore circulation, perfusion.  Insulin → halt ketone production.  Replace → electrolyte deficits.  Treat → precipitating causes.  Monitor → response to treatment and for complications of therapy.1. Fluids  Give fluids to compensate for the osmotic diuresis.  Start with normal saline; go slowly to prevent the risk of cerebral edema or CHF (especially in children).  Just like we saw in GU, monitor the osmolality of the urine and compare it with what you’re putting in, to determine whether you’re increasing or decreasing the serum osmolality.2. Electrolytes  The main issue here is potassium.  Potassium is often seen to be high on presentation, but this is due to low insulin.  Recall that insulin and catecholamines are used to shift K+ with hyperkalemia.          Recall that insulin shifts K+ from the ECF into the ICF.      As a consequence, when the insulin is low, you have a false high extracellular K+.        Hence, you may have a measured high K+, but an actual low total body K+.  Hence, you only supplement low potassium:          If K+ &gt; 5, you don’t treat it.      If K+ is from 3.3-5, then add 20-30 mEq/L KCl.      If K+ &lt; 3.3, then add 40 mEq/L KCl.        With high potassium, the insulin should naturally bring it down.3. Insulin  Lowers blood glucose, stops lipolysis, inhibits glucagon.  Intravenous (IM), not SC (patients have hypoperfusion).  Monitor hourly.          Don’t write nomograms or sliding scales, don’t rely on nursing staff to call you with abnormal values (they are busy too). Check each value yourself and come back to examine the patient frequently.        Maintain blood glucose within 7-14.  If BG falls low, Do NOT stop insulin infusion; instead increase dextrose in IV.          Otherwise DKA could recur.        Delay giving the insulin bolus if the serum K is low.          As mentioned above, insulin shifts K+ from the ECF into the ICF.      So if the serum K is already low, it’ll fall even lower.        Aside      What about using bicarbonate to treat the acidosis?    Very controversial; thought to actually slow recovery.    In general, don’t do it; consider only if the patient is severely acidotic (pH &lt; 7).  Stopping Treatment for DKA  You can stop IV insulin and return to SC insulin at the following criteria:          Glucose &lt; 11, HCO3 &gt; 18, pH &gt; 7.3, normal anion gap.        It’s best to use the anion gap to determine when to stop IV insulin → ketones and pH may lag behind.Complications with Treatment  Hypoglycemia → if you overdo the insulin.  Hypokalemia → too much insulin, or insufficient replacement of K+ beforehand).  Hyperglycemia/Recurrent DKA → if the IV insulin is stopped too early.  Hyperchloremic Acidosis → NAGMA, excessive NaCl administration, ketones excreted with Na or K in urine → excess Cl.  Cerebral Edema → probably due to rapid osmotic movement of water into the CNS due to rapid drops in plasma osmolality.          Much more common in children, rare in adults.      Most common cause of death in children with DKA → there’s a 40-90% mortality rate (!).      Correct fluids slowly!      Typically presents 4-12 hours after the onset of treatment, with headache, deterioration or consciousness, slowing of the HR, or an ↑ BP.      Risk Factors for Cerebral Edema  Younger age.  New diagnosis of DM.  Severity of the acidosis.  ↓ pCO2.  ↑ BUN.  Treatment with HCO3.  Rapid rate of fluid resuscitation.  Key Points in Treating Acute Complications of Diabetes      The patient needs fluid, but not too much fluid! Give it slowly.    Although the measured K+ may be normal, the patient is K+ depleted, because of ICF→ECF shifts.    Never stop the insulin → if the glucose falls too low, instead add more dextrose to IV.

	{"title": "Adrenal Focal Cases", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary  A 31-year-old woman was referred for treatment of hypertension, first noticed during her last pregnancy two years ago. The hypertension had become progressively worse and required increasing amounts of Propranolol and diuretics. During the work-up for hypertension it was found that she also had glucose intolerance. Initial investigations for the hypertension (done while she was off anti-hypertensive therapy) revealed slightly low potassium levels and elevated blood sugars but no other abnormality.  On physical examination the patient was obese and had pre-auricular fat pads. The supraclavicular triangle was found to be bulging. She had chemosis and thin skin over the dorsum of her hands. There was minimal proximal muscle weakness in the legs. She had mild hirsutism and acne but no striae.  Give at least 2 examples of the effects of each type of hormone involved, and outline the pathophysiology of the symptoms and signs in this lady.          Cortisol excess → chemosis, thin skin.      Fat padding over the supraclavicular triangle (key to differentiating Cushing’s from obesity).                  High androgens → hirsutism and acne.          High mineralicorticoids, aldosterone, Na+ retention (hypertensive effect) and hyperkalemia.                      a) What initial test(s) would be most efficient in this situation? b) List 4 causes of a false positive screening test.          Suppression Dexamethasone.      24-hour free cortisol.      Saliva cortisol → standardize at 11 PM.      Serum free cortisol → standardize at 8 AM.                  False positives:          Birth control pills → estrogen excess.          Serum cortisol measures total (bound).          Estrogen increases binding, so free may even be lower.          Depression, alcoholism, obesity.          Obesity due to estrogen release with adipose tissue.          High stress situation, since it can trigger cortisol release.          Serum cortisol measures total bound cortisol (to cortisol binding globulin).          Saliva cortisol measures free cortisol, so it measures active cortisol.          Outpatient → rationale is that labs aren’t open at 11PM.                      How would you confirm the diagnosis?          2 day dexamethasone suppression.      Or B2B urinary is also a possible confirmatory test.      Case #2  A 42-year-old presents with weight gain of 20 pounds in the past year despite a decrease in her diet. Her husband tells her she doesn’t eat enough for a bird. She has been walking 30 minutes every day. She has otherwise been well. There is no significant family history.  On examination she was 88 kg with a height of 154 cm.  Pituitary vs Adrenal Cushing’s.  Pituitary will only increase Cortisol.  Adrenal will increase everything.  Differentiate Cushing’s Disease from Cushing’s Syndrome.  What other questions could you ask on history?          Cold intolerance, fatigue, hypothyroidism.      Quantify their diet → how many meals do you eat? What do you eat? All patients will tell you they don’t eat much, but when you actually get at their dietary history, it’s a whole different story.      Medications → steroids, tricyclic antidepressants, OCP, hormone replacement therapy.      R/o pregnancy → always in a female.      DDx:                  Hypothyroidism.          Medications.          Lifestyle.          Cushing’s → changes in skin, striae, fat padding, muscle weakness.          Acromegaly → change in clothing size, dentition, dental imprints in buccal mucosa, pictures of old driver’s license. See frontal bossing, prominent jaw, more acne, oily skin.                      What other areas of the physical examination would you be sure to inspect?          Physical signs of everything we’ve mentioned.      Look at thyroid → goiter.      Vitals → hypertension, bradycardia/tachycardia.      ‘Hung-up reflex’ → delayed relaxation phase of the reflex.      Sign of glucose intolerance (Cushings, acromegaly) on P/E? Acanthosis nigricans, axillary, back of neck, waist folds.        List screening lab tests would you considering ordering and a reason for each.          High cortisol? (Recall cortisol isn’t the best test) 24 hour urine.                  Because serum cortisol is variable over the day, esp. in response to stress.                    GH levels? Measure IGF-1.      Hypothyroidism? Measure TSH.      Serum glucose, glucose tolerance test!?                  Metabolic syndrome.          Triglycerides, abdo weight diameter, hypertension.                    Electrolytes                  See high Na+, low K+. More likely to see low K+ unless they’re floridly Cushing’s.          Opposite with adrenal insufficiency -&gt; WILL ALMOST ALWAYS SEE WEIGHT LOSS.                    If all negative, probably wrong with diet Hx, so do a food log.      Case #3  Case Summary  A 41-year-old man is discovered to be hypertensive on a routine physical examination. He had been complaining of some muscle weakness but was otherwise asymptomatic. Physical examination was normal apart from his blood pressure (160/105). BP was repeated on several occasions and always measured above 150/95.  Laboratory examination reveals:- Serum	 - Na 138 mmol/L (135-145).	 - K 2.3 mmol/L (3.5-4.5).	 - Cl 98 mmol/L (95-106).	 - HCO3 32 mmol/L (24-31).  What is your differential diagnosis for hypertension?          Essential hypertension.      Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s).      Renal artery stenosis (rare). With ACEI, will be profoundly hypokalemic (think about mechanism).      Cushing’s.      Black licorice. Ha.        What initial screening test would be most efficient in this situation?          Aldosterone:renin ratio.        Assuming the screening test is positive what further tests would you order to confirm the diagnosis?          If that’s positive, next test is urine aldosterone, look at response after a salt load (Saline infusion test).      Or empiric Tx with Spironolactone.      CT adrenals to r/o adrenal hyperplasia.                  Plasma/urine + salt loading.          Spironolactone empiric Tx are the 2 main options. If doesn’t fix, then primary hyperaldosteronism or essential hypertension (most common).                    Case #4  Case Summary  A 28-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of palpitations, shakiness, and sweating. These symptoms occur episodically starting suddenly and ending in a few minutes to an hour or so. They seem to be occurring more frequently.  List 5 other questions that will be helpful in determining the cause for these symptoms and indicate how each would be helpful.          Does it happen with caffeine?      Hx of heart problems?      Thyrotoxicosis? Less likely to be episodic.      Hypoglycemic.      Associated with anxiety? R/o anxiety attacks.      Symptoms of diabetes? frequent urination?      High chronic blood sugars. But diabetes are just as likely to be hypoglycemic unless they’re on Tx.      Or insulinoma!?      Cocaine, fluoroquinolones, beta-blockers can make you hypoglycemic.        How would you determine whether a pheochromocytoma is causing his symptoms?          Catecholamines in blood.      Look for the classic triad, orthostatic blood pressure.      Case #5  Case Summary  Mary Brown, a 21-year-old law student, is very concerned because she has to shave her chin and upper lip on a daily basis and cannot wear a bikini without shaving her abdomen. The hair growth started when she was 14 years old and has gradually become worse. Her periods started at the age of 12 and have always been very irregular. She has never been on birth control pills. Her father is quite hairy and one of his sisters has facial hair.  On examination she has significant terminal hair growth on her chin, upper lip, and in front of her ears. She has a male-pattern of hair growth on her abdomen with hair extending above the umbilicus. There is no clitoral hypertrophy and no other signs of virilization.  What are the 2 mostly likely diagnoses? Give justifications.          PCOS! Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She’s classic for this, especially if she’s having trouble getting pregnant.      Late onset CAH. Can get it at the onset of puberty.        List 5 blood tests you would order.  Imaging US  Physical exam: overweight, acne, hirsutism.  Measure LH, FSH levels.  Measure testosterone.  Serum 17 hydroxyprogesterone steroid.  DHEAS, precursor to BLEH hormones.  2 more hormones that can present with this picture, but less common. Always want to do this with irregular periods.          Prolactin → Prolactinoma.      TSH (hypothyroid) can affect periods too.        Definitely do β-HCG ahahaha!  What are 4 therapies you could offer Mary?          Oral contraceptives.      Spironolactone (long term commitment, minimum 6 months before results).      Mechanical -&gt; shaving, laser Tx (mainstay actually).      Case #6  Case Summary  A 37-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with severe weakness. Over the past year she noted increased pigmentation and freckling of the face, back, hands, elbows, and knees. She had a 15 pound weight loss, extreme weakness, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Upon standing she had lightheadedness. She has a past history of goitre and had complaints of cold intolerance, dry skin, somnolence, and constipation. There is no family history of endocrine disorders.Examination revealed a thin, pigmented, chronically ill woman. Blood pressure was 100/60 supine, and 0/0 standing. The pulse went from 84 to 120 on standing. Increased freckling and vitiligo were apparent around the eyes. No mucosal pigmentations were noted. The thyroid was slightly enlarged and firm. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. She had dark pigmentation of the nipples. There was no axillary or pubic hair. Neurological examination was normal except for generalized muscle weakness. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical with normal relaxation phase. The rest of the exam was normal.SerumNa 125 mmol/L K 6.7 mmol/L Cl 90 mmol/L HCO3 24.8 mmol/L Glucose 2.0 mmol/L Creat 110 umol/L Urea 7 mmol/L TSH 7.3 mU/L(135-145) (3.5-4.5) (95-106) (24-31) (3.6-6.3) (70-120) (3.5-7.0) (0.5-5.5)Serum calcium, magnesium and liver function tests were normal. Electrocardiogram showed peaked T waves. Chest X-ray was normal.  What is the likely diagnosis? Provide justifications.          Addison’s. Hyperpigmentation in scars, palmar creases, in mouth.      Sodium low, potassium high.      Weight loss.      No axillary/pubic hair:                  More likely to be primary vs central, since the adrenal glands make 3 types of hormones, so primary would affect all 3.          If central, multiple pathways must be affected.                    But then what about the TSH?                  Addison’s is autoimmune.          Could be autoimmne thyroid issue.          Makes them much more likely to have Addison’s.                      What do the peaked T-waves signify?          Hyperkalemia.        How would you confirm the diagnosis?          ACTH should be high in Addison’s (Primary adrenal insufficiency!?).      ACTH should be low in Central.      Problem with endocrinology is that you can’t do the same tests with high/low.        What is the most common cause of the disease in industrialized countries?          Autoimmune.      TB.        What therapy would you initiate immediately?  Why is the TSH elevated?          Autoimmune thyroiditis.      Glucocorticoids can suppress thyroid because feedback loops are intertwined.        What 2 persistent findings would cause you to initiate therapy with the oral mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone (Flornief)?          BP and potassium.      You actually titrate dose of Flornief by BP.      Case #7  Case Summary  Oliver is a 2-week-old brought into the ER by ambulance. In the past 24 hours he has been vomiting and dehydrated and his mother found him unconscious in his crib. They are from a small town outside of London and Oliver was born via home birth and didn’t undergo any newborn screening. Oliver is her first child.Laboratory results show:SerumNa 120 mmol/L (135-145) K 7.5 mmol/L (3.5-5.0) Glucose 2.7 mmol/L (3.4-7.0) Cortisol 97 nmol/L (119-618)  Based on the lab findings, what is currently happening to Oliver?          Adrenal insufficiency.      Since glucose and cortisol are affected, probably primary adrenal insfficiency.      CAH. 21-hydroxylase deficiency, something beta, another one.                  3 types.                    21-hydroxylase is most common.        Putting the history and lab findings together, what is your suspected diagnosis? List3 underlying causes.b) What would be the most common cause? What diagnostic test can you perform to confirm?  How will you manage Oliver: a) Acutely?b) In the long term?          Stress dose during ill or stress.      2-3 the amount depending on the stress level.        Oliver’s mother wants to know if her future children will have CAH. What do you tell her?  What preventative measures can you suggest to Oliver’s mother?          Dexamethasone until U/S to determine if female. Female is what you have to worry about.       Newborn screening.        17 LHP. Should be greatly elevated, right before the enzyme.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/endocrinology/2014/10/21/adrenal-focus-cases.html"},

	{"title": "Sex Determination &amp; Differentiation", "text": "Introduction &amp; Key Concepts  The key differentiating factor between a male and a female is the presence of a Y chromosome.  What on the Y chromosome predisposes you to being a male?          The SRY gene (Sex-determining Region on Y Chromosome).      This is a tiny genetic locus found on the anterior end of the short arm on the Y chromosome.        So if you have SRY, and it’s expressed at the right time at development, you’ll develop testes.          In particular, they trigger the formation of Sertoli cells, which as we saw in GU, were the epithelial cells that line the seminiferous tubules.      Sertoli cells support the development of the germ cells into spermatogonia during puberty.        In other words, the Y Chromosome → SRY → Sertoli Cells → Testes.  Once you have testes, what do they produce (aside from spermatozoa)?          They produce 2 key hormones:                  Testosterone → produced by Leydig Cells.          Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) → produced by Sertoli Cells.                      In early development, the fetus is completely undifferentiated → it can develop into either a female or a male depending on what gonad forms.          If testes form (in the presence of SRY), androgens are produced, which act on the male primordial structures to produce a male reproductive tract.      In addition, the Sertoli cells in the testes produce MIS, which prevents the female primordial structures from developing.        What about the development of the penis? (heh heh heh)          Testosterone is converted to Dihydrotestosterone (5α-dihydrotestosterone, DHT) by 5α-reductase, which is a much stronger androgen.                  Testosterone, which is produced by the Sertoli cells of the testes, gets diluted on the way to the urogenital sinus, and isn’t potent enough to induce penile formation.          To resolve this, 5α-reductase is expressed in the urogenital sinus, and amplifies the testosterone by converting it to a more active form → DHT.                    This induces the penis to grow off of the urogenital sinus.        Summary of Male Sexual Differentiation      The SRY gene on the Y chromosome predisposes you to being a male.    It triggers the formation of the testes, in particular Sertoli Cells.    The testes secrete two hormones:              Testosterone → secreted by Leydig Cells.                      Testosterone (and a stronger analogue, DHT), act on the male primordial structures to produce a male reproductive tract.                          Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) → secreted by Sertoli Cells.                      MIS inhibits the development of the female primordial structures.                                In order for the external genitalia to develop, testosterone must be converted to a more potent form called dihydrotestosterone (DHT).              This conversion is mediated by 5α-reductase.            The Jost Paradigm for Sexual Differentiation  Jost Paradigm → chromosomal sex (genetic) determines gonadal sex (primary sex differentiation), which determines phenotypic sex (secondary sex differentiation).  This matches well with what we’ve discussed above:          Chromosomal Sex → Y chromosome, SRY gene.      Gonadal Sex → development of the testes.      Phenotypic Sex → development of the external genitalia.      Discovery of the ‘Testis Determining Factor’  We didn’t actually know that the Y chromosome was required for male differentiation until the late 1950’s, when karyotyping was developed.          In individuals with only the short arm of the Y chromosome, there was no phenotypic change.      In individuals with only the long arm of the Y chromosome, they were completely phenotypically female.        This suggested that there was something on the short arm of the Y chromosome (later discovered to be the SRY gene), that was critical to sexual diferentiation.          They proposed to name this the Testis Determining Factor (TDF).      It was postulated that this was a single gene, that regulated a cascade of other genes, which would cause sertoli cell differentiation, leading to testicular formation.      Primary Sex Reversal  When the X and Y chromosome line up during meiosis and crossing-over occurs, it’s possible for the end of short arm of the Y-chromosome (where SRY is located), to end up on the X-chromosome.          This either results in an XX individual that is phenotypically male, or an XY individual that is phenotypically female, depending on which chromosome is passed on.      This is known as Primary Sex Reversal, and it occurs in approximately 1/20,000 births.      SRY as a Repressor/Inhibitor  McElreavey et al., 1993 PNAS Study.  In this study, the investigators performed PCR on over 100 XX males, and looked for the presence of the SRY gene.          Of the 35 XX males with no ambiguous genitalia, 32 were SRY positive.                  This is the primary sex reversal we discussed above.                    Of the 38 XX males with ambiguous genitalia, only 2 were SRY positive.      Of the 46 XX hermaphroditic males, only 4 were SRY positive.        This suggests that most cases of sex-reversal are not SRY related, and involve the function of other genes.          They postulated that their results were due to the presence of another gene, ‘Z’, that SRY had effects on.      They suggested that SRY’s main role was as an inhibitor of this ‘Z’ gene.                  With SRY, Z is inhibited, allowing for the formation of the male gonads.          Without SRY, Z is active, allowing for the formation of the female gonads.                    In the above cases where SRY is absent, and there’s virilization, the researchers postulated that there was a functional mutation in ‘Z’.      Other Sex Determination Genes  It turned out that this hypothesis was correct, and there is a particular gene that fits the model:          Dax-1 → DSS dosage sensitive sex reversal: X-linked.                  Located on the X-chromosome, and is inhibited by SRY.                          Dax-1 is turned off during testis formation.              Dax-1 is turned on during ovary formation.                                In patients with a Dax-1 duplication, you can actually have sex-reversal in XY individuals (it’ll exceed the inhibition by SRY).          So Dax-1 is the gene Z described in our previous model.                      Other genes were discovered that add to this model:          SOX9                  Autosomal gene, mutations in it result in campomelic dysplasia.          Campomelic dysplasia → severe dwarfism; bone disorder with XY reversal in 3/4 of males.          SOX9 is required for sertoli cell development.          Dax 1 may repress SOX9 during ovary development, so SRY represses Dax-1, which represses SRY.                      Nowadays, we know that there are over 30 critical sex determining genes. However, the basic conceptual framework that we need for understanding most sexual differentiation disorders is the basic one with SRY, Dax-1, and SOX9.  Important      SRY inhibits Dax-1, which inhibits SOX9.  Gonad Development  Primordial germ cells migrate from the yolk sac into the developing embryo during the 4th week of development.  At the 5th week of gestation, we have what’s known as an ‘indifferent gonad’ → something that can become either the ovary or the testes. It consists of the following:          Germ Cells → these were the ones that migrated from the yolk sac.      Supporting Cells → these either become Sertoli Cells (male) or Granulosa Cells (female).      Stromal Cells        The indifferent gonad also has two rudimentary systems, which can develop into the male or female reproductive system:          The male system is the mesonephric duct, also known as the Wolffian duct.      The female system is the paramesonephric duct, also known as the Mullerian duct.        Classical experiments by Alfred Jost showed how the fetus ‘decides’ between these two rudimentary systems.          In female rabbit fetuses, he grafted a testis right next to one of the 2 developing ovaries.                  On the side where the testis was grafted, a fallopian tube did not develop; instead, male Wolffian structures formed.          The other side was perfectly normal.                    Now, interested in determining what factors in the testis contribute to male reproductive system development, he grafted a testosterone crystal instead of a testis.                  On the side with the crystal, both a Mullerian duct and Wolffian structures formed.                      This led him to the following conclusions:          The testis produces Testosterone which stimulates the formation of the male reproductive system.      The testis must produce something else that inhibits female reproductive system development → later found to be MIS.        Mullerian Inhibiting Substance          Member of the TCF-β family; acts locally (autocrine).      Inhibits formation of the female reproductive system, but only in a very short time window.      If it’s blocked over this interval, eg. with monoclonal antibodies to MIS, then the Mullerian duct will persist.      This is known as Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome.      Androgen Disorders  As mentioned before, Testosterone is converted to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5α-reductase.          There are 2 isoforms of 5α-reductase.      The main form is expressed in the urogenital tract; the other form is expressed in hair follicles and play a large role in male pattern baldness.        Testosterone virilizes the primordial Wolffian Duct, however it’s at too low a concentration at the urogenital sinus to stimulate formation of the external genitalia.  DHT stimualtes differentiation of the male urethra, prostate, and external genitalia.  Below are two androgen disorders along the same pathway, that affect (1) conversion of testosterone to DHT, or (2) sensitivity to androgens.  5α-reductase deficiency:          Will result in 46 XY males presenting as phenotypic females, or severely undervirilized males, depending on the mutation.      All the internal machinery is normal, but it ends in a ‘pseudovagina’ instead of a penis.      This makes sense, as DHT is necessary for the development of the external genitalia.        Testicular Feminization:          Typically result from mutations in the androgen receptor.      These patients have testes, and normal androgen levels, but they’re either partially or completely insensitive to androgens.      In patients that have CAIS (Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome), they will phenotypically look entirely like a normal female.      The only difference is that they will lack normal female internal genitalia (they will still have testes), and will thus be unable to have children.      This also makes sense:                  Since they still have SRY, they still repress Dax-1, which represses SOX9, which leads to Sertoli Cell formation and testes development. Sertoli cells also secrete MIS, which inhibits formation of the internal female reproductive system.          However, since they aren’t sensitive to testosterone or DHT, they don’t have formation of the Wolffian duct, nor any male external genitalia.

	{"title": "Review of Adrenal Testing &amp; Imaging", "text": "Adrenal Testing  Most testing is done nowadays with immunoassays, which have replaced older and more cumbersome tests.  These tests are still sometimes used, but don’t order them. For historical interest, these methods include liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, or colorimetric assays for specific steroids.Adrenal Cortex Tests  Adrenal Glucocorticoids → from the zona fasciculata.          Baseline Tests.      Dynamic Tests.        Adrenal Mineralicorticoids → from the zona glomerulosa.          Baseline Tests.      Dynamic Tests.        Adrenal Androgens → from the zona reticularis.  An easy way to remember which hormones are released from where is to remember the GFR (Glomerulosa, Fasciculata, Reticularis) corresponds to salt, sugar, and sex.  Baseline → we’re not doing anything to the patient when we’re performing the test.  Dynamic → we are doing something (eg. giving them a hormone), and are monitoring their response.Adrenal GlucocorticoidsBaseline Tests  AM Serum Cortisol.          Used for Adrenal Insufficiency.      Measured at 8 or 9 AM.      Recall that this was because Cortisol is normally high in the morning, so a AM cortisol would be more sensitive for low values.                  &lt;100 → likely AI.          &gt;500 → unlikely AI, unless their CBG↑ (OCP, pregnancy).          In-between, it’s a gray-zone, where you would then try dynamic testing.                    Recall that this is a total cortisol measurement, including bound cortisol (typically bound to CBG), and free cortisol.                  Only the free cortisol is biologically active, but we don’t have a serum assay for it.          Also, CBG can be elevated with birth control or with pregnancy, so you may have an elevated total cortisol with a normal free cortisol, resulting in a false increase.          As a result, this test is not effective for looking for cortisol overproduction → which is why it’s only used for Adrenal Insufficiency.                      24 Hour Urine for Free Cortisol.          Used for Adrenal Overproduction (Cushing’s Syndrome).                  Recall that Cushing’s Syndrome = Glucocorticoid Overproduction, while Cushing’s Disease = Glucocorticoid Overproduction from a Pituitary Cause.          This is the best test for high levels of corticosteroids, and is diagnostic if &gt;3x the upper limit of normal.          This test doesn’t look at the lower limit → so it’s not good for adrenal insufficiency.          One negative however is that it’s a pain-in-the-ass for patients.                    Measures free cortisol.        Baseline Tests for Adrenal Glucocorticoids      The 8 AM Serum Cortisol is the best test for Adrenal Insufficiency.    The 24 Hour Free Cortisol is the best test for Adrenal Overproduction.    The 11 PM Salivary Cortisol is also useful with Adrenal Overproduction, to look for loss of diurnal rhythm, but it isn’t widely available in Canada (at the moment).    What about 11 PM Salivary Cortisol?          Currently not freely available in Canada.      Recall that this was used in suspect Adrenal Overproduction, to look for loss of diurnal rhythm in cortisol excretion (normally it should be low at night).      This is lost in pathological conditions.      Why not evening serum cortisol? It’s not very practical, since labs are closed at night. Also, salivary free cortisol isn’t affected by OCP/pregnancy.        Remember      Serum Cortisol → Total Cortisol (= Free + Bound).    24 Hour Urine → Free Cortisol.    Salivary Cortisol → Free Cortisol.    Bound cortisol will increase in OCP and Pregnancy, due to an increase in Corticosteroid Binding Globulin (CBG). This may result in falsely high values.    What about the ACTH Level?          The ACTH is useful in diagnosing primary adrenal insufficiency → ACTH would be high.      It’s also useful in determining the cause of Cushing’s Syndrome → whether it’s ACTH dependent (↑ pituitary production) or ACTH independent (loss of regulation).      Note → ACTH is very labile, so if it’s improperly collected, it may be degraded, and will thus be falsely low. So if the clinical syndrome doesn’t fit with the ACTH, verify if it was properly collected.      Dynamic Tests  If hyposecretion (insufficiency) is suspected, then you would want see if production can still be stimulated.          Done with the 250 µg ACTH (cosyntropin) Stimulation Test → uses an ACTH analogue to stimulate the adrenals.                  IV or IM bolus → serum cortisol increases &gt;500 (minimum 250 increase).          Doesn’t help you determine if it’s a primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency; it only helps you make a diagnosis if the 8 AM serum cortisol was in that gray area (100-500).                      If hypersecretion (overproduction) is suspected, then you would want see if production can still be suppressed.          Done with the 1 mg Dexamethasone Suppression Test → uses a corticosteroid to try and suppress ACTH production.                  Given at 11 PM, measured the next morning at 8 AM.          Cortisol levels the next morning should normally be &lt; 50 nM/L.          If it’s &gt; 50 nM/L, then they have an abnormal response → Cushing’s Syndrome.          Since we’re measuring serum cortisol with this, it can be confounded by:                          ↑ CBG (OCP, Pregnancy). → if they’re on birth control or pregnancy, do the 24 hour urine free cortisol.              ↑ Dexamethasone metabolism → if it’s metabolized quickly, it won’t be able to suppress the HPA axis.              Lack of compliance → the patient has to take the pill!                                            Dynamic Testing For Adrenal Glucocorticoids      Hyposecretion → stimulation (250 µg ACTH Stimulation Test).    Hypersecretion → suppression (1 mg Dexamethasone Suppression Test).    If either the 24 hour urine free cortisol or the 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test are abnormal, then the next test is another dynamic test called a high dose dexamethasone suppression test (8 mg).          The purpose of the high dose one is to help determine the etiology of the Cushing’s Syndrome.      If you have Cushing’s Disease, you should suppress → the pituitary still has feedback, it’s just set at a higher level.      If it’s not Cushing’s Disease, then you won’t have suppression on high dose dexamethasone.

Adrenal Mineralicorticoids  Very weakly affected by the HPA axis, through cross-reactivity of cortisol to the mineralicorticoid receptor.  Primarily regulated by the RAAS System, which we’ve seen a million times.Hypoaldosteronism  With primary adrenal insufficiency (eg. with Addison’s Disease), you have Aldosterone ↓, Na+ ↓, and K+ ↑.  Because you lose Na+, and water follows the salt, you end up hypotensive.  Hence we end up with:          Hyponatremia.      Hyperkalemia.      Hypotension.        Tests are usually not necessary for hypoaldosteronism → can usually be seen from the clinical picture.          Also, if it’s a primary adrenal problem, then it’ll affect the glucocorticoids too, so you can use the diagnostic algorithm for adrenal insufficiency shown previously.      Hyperaldosteronism  We do perform tests for hyperaldosteronism.  Why do we need to do tests?  It’ll help direct medical/surgical/radiological treatment for:          Primary hyperaldosteronism.      Primary renal artery stenosis (secondary hyperaldosteronism)      Primary hypertension.      Primary Hyperaldosteronism  Also known as Conn’s Syndrome.  Feedback is intact, so renin is low.We saw this in GU with the functions of the principal cell and the α-intercalated cell. Review Reabsorption &amp; Secretion from GU.  However, since aldosterone is high, we have ↑ Na+ retention, ↑ K+ secretion, and ↑ H+ secretion. resulting in hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.  Here, the aldosterone:renin ratio is high → recall that with ectopic aldosterone production, it’s no longer renin-dependent, so the ratio should be high.Secondary Hyperaldosteronism  Here, the kidney is secreting excess renin, leading to increased aldosterone, and the same clinical effects as before.          This can be seen in renal artery stenosis, where the juxtaglomerular cells sense low flow due to the stenosis, triggering renin production.        However, since there isn’t ectopic aldosterone production, aldosterone is still renin dependent here.  Hence, the aldosterone:renin ratio is normal, or sometimes even low.  Primary vs Secondary Hyperaldosteronism                             Primary        Secondary                            Na+        ↑        ↑                    K+        ↓        ↓                    H+        ↓        ↓                    Aldosterone:Renin Ratio        High        Normal/Low              Since you need to look at the relationship between aldosterone and renin to properly know what’s going on with hyperaldosteronism, the best baseline test is the aldosterone:renin ratio.          Measuring the serum renin individually, or the serum aldosterone individually, is insufficient.      Aldosterone itself is also suppressed whtn the K+ is low, so K+ must be &gt; 4 for the aldosterone component to be reliable.        Baseline Tests for Adrenal Mineralicorticoids      The Aldosterone:Renin Ratio is the best test for Hyperaldosteronism.  Dynamic Testing  Suppression Tests          Used to confirm primary hyper-aldosteronism.      Done via a saline infusion, or via exogenous mineralicorticoid (fludrocortisone) → normally this should suppress the RAAS system; if there’s primary hyperaldosteronism, there will be a failure to suppress.        Stimulation Tests          Used to confirm primary hypo-aldosteronism.      Furosemide +/- salt restriction cause salt loss and hypotension, so they should increase renin to maintain BP.      In patients with a primary hypoaldosteronism, the adrenals will be unable to respond adequately to the increased renin.        Dynamic Testing for Adrenal Mineralicorticoids      Saline Infusion Suppression Test can be used to confirm primary hyper-aldosteronism.    Furosemide +/- Salt Restriction Stimulation can be used to confirm primary hypo-aldosteronism.

This is because most of the testosterone in women is from the peripheral conversion of androgens.        These tests include:          Serum Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate (DHEAS)                  Specific for virilizing tumours → most virilizing tumours add a sulphate onto the DHEA.                    Serum Androstenedione        Both are baseline tests, although they can also be used as dynamic tests by measuring them in serum after suppression with dexamethasone.          Dynamic tests with these are extremely rarely done.        There are also indirect tests:          Serum Testosterone                  Not directly secreted by the adrenal, but adrenal androgens can be converted to testosterone.

Indirect colorimetric method for measuring adrenal androgens.          Don’t order this.                      Baseline Tests for Adrenal Androgens      Serum Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate (DHEAS)    Serum Androstenedione    Serum Testosterone → indirect test, since adrenal androgens are converted to testosterone.  Example Case  Case Summary      Mrs. Mary Oliver is a pleasant 35-year-old woman.    She presents to urgent medical clinic with a 6 month history of a 30 pound weight loss.     At first her appetite was increased.    However, over the past month she has become anorexic and has experienced recurrent nausea and vomiting, crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea.    Food seems to be tasteless unless she puts extra salt on it.     She has also felt lightheaded on standing, has frequent palpitations, and has become shaky and irritable.     She also noted increased sweating and heat intolerance.    Her friends frequently ask her if she has been down south.    She has lost her axillary and pubic hair.     Mary also noticed she was thirstier than usual.    She has been more anxious, nervous, and tired with trouble getting to sleep and waking frequently.    Her menses have become irregular over the past year with the last one occurring 2 months ago.     Physical Examination      She has a good tan with some pigmentation of her knees and elbows and buccal mucosa, but no other abnormal pigmentation.     Her blood pressure is 100/60 lying and 70/40 standing and her pulse increases from 100 to 130/min.     Fine tremor of the outstretched hands.    Skin is warm and moist but her mucous membranes appear dry.     Thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged and meaty with bruits over both lobes.     Axillary and pubic hair are absent.  Findings  Here the patient actually has 2 disorders.          Hyperpigmentation, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, salt-craving, loss of pubic hair, and abdominal pain suggests Addison’s Disease, a cause of primary adrenal insufficiency.      Fine tremors, sweating, heat intolerance, and diffuse thyroid enlargement suggest Graves’ Disease.        Additional Information      Electrolytes show low sodium, high potassium.    AM Cortisol was 50.    ACTH is pending.    The low sodium, high potassium, and low BP are suggestive of hypoaldosteronism.  The AM Cortisol is &lt; 100, so this is positive for adrenal insufficiency.  What would you expect the ACTH to be?          It should be high, to try and stimulate the adrenals.        The patient’s Addison’s must be treated before her Graves’. Why?          Her Addison’s could lead to an adrenal crisis, which can be fatal.      Acute Adrenal Insufficiency (Adrenal Crisis)  Acute Treatment          Monitor ABCs, electrolytes, glucose.      IV fluids to resolve hypotension.      Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus, followed by 50-100 mg Q 6-8 h.      Mineralicorticoid supplementation isn’t necessary acutely because we have such a high dose of the hydrocortisone, which is cross reactive.        Subacute Treatment          Taper fluids, corticosteroids.      Now you need to start mineralicorticoids (Florinef, aka Fludrocortisone), because we can’t rely on cross-reactivity here.        Maintenance therapy.          Glucocorticoid + Mineralicorticoid Replacement.      Hydrocortisone for the glucocorticoid.      Fludrocortisone for the mineralicorticoid.        This patient actually had Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type 1          We saw this briefly in the Adrenal Insufficiency lecture.      The take home point here is that auto-immune endocrine disorders can run together! Be cognizant of this in the future!      Answers  Glucocorticoid Testing          This is is normal. Anything &lt; 100 is Adrenal Insufficiency; for the AM serum cortisol, anything &gt; 500 is normal; anything from 100 to 500 is in a gray area and requires a subsequent ACTH stimulation test.      This is adrenal insufficiency. Anything &lt; 100 is Adrenal Insufficiency; for the AM serum cortisol, anything &gt; 500 is normal; anything from 100 to 500 is in a gray area and requires a subsequent ACTH stimulation test.      This is Cushing’s Syndrome. Anything &gt; 50 nM/L is positive for Cushing’s; anything &lt; 50 is normal.      This is normal. Anything &gt; 50 nM/L is positive for Cushing’s; anything &lt; 50 is normal.        Mineralicorticoid Testing          This is secondary hyperaldosteronism. Both renin and aldosterone are high, but their ratio is normal. Hence aldosterone is still dependent on renin, and the kidney is just secreting excess renin.      This is primary hyperaldosteronism.       This is normal. Note that aldosterone and renin are both in normal ranges here and in the previous case.                   However, in the previous question, the ratio is abnormal, and in this one, the ratio is normal.          Clearly, the aldosterone:renin ratio is more important than their individual absolute values.

Lecture Outline  Stress, Adrenals &amp; Cortisol  Adrenal insufficiency (AI)          Symptoms, Signs, Adrenal Crisis (acute insufficiency).        Etiology of AI          Addison’s disease.      Metastasis.      Tuberculosis.      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.      Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.      Hypopituitarism.        Screening of AI → primary vs secondary.  Diagnosis of AI → primary vs secondary.  Treatment of AI → acute, subacute, chronic, maintenance therapy.  Cases  Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type IStress, Adrenals, and Cortisol  Cortisol (adrenals) responds to ACTH (pituitary), which responds to CRH (hypothalamus), which responds to stress  Stress → disruption caused by changes in the environment, which exceeds the ability to respond          Either more stress than you can handle.      Or less response than appropriate.      Adrenal InsufficiencySymptoms  Weakness, tireness, fatigue (100%)          “not being able to do what you used to do”        Anorexia (100%) → but rule out cancer, etc.  Gastrointestinal symptoms          Nausea (86%)      Vomiting (75%)      Constipation (33%)      Abdo pain (31%)      Diarrhea (16%)        Salt craving (16%)          Less aldosterone → less salt retention.        Postural dizziness (12%)          Less aldosterone → less salt retention → less fluid retention → pressure drop.        Muscle or joint pain (6-13%)Signs  Weight loss (100%)  Hyperpigmentation (94%)          In response to adrenal insufficiency, the pituitary makes more ACTH      ACTH comes from POMC gene, which also makes MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Hence, we end up with hyperpigmentation.        Hypotension (&lt;110 mm Hg systolic) (88-94%)  Vitiligo (10-20%)          Depigmentation, immune-mediated (many adrenal insufficiency cases are autoimmune).        Auricular calcifications (5%) → rarely seen, only in men.Symptoms of AI are shown on the left, and etiologies are shown on the right.Laboratory InvestigationsNa+ ↓, K+  ↑, and BP ↓ is classic for adrenal insufficiency.  Electrolyte disturbances (92%)          Na+ ↓ (88%) → effect of aldosterone ↓ and cortisol ↓.      K+ ↑ (64%) → again, due to effects of ↓ aldosterone and cortisol (cross reactive with the mineralicorticoid receptor).      Ca2+ ↑ (6%)        Azotemia (55%)          Renal failure; from dehydration (due to loss of salt and fluid control).        Anemia (40%)  Eosinophilia (17%)          Was the best test for adrenal insufficiency 40 years ago; nobody uses it now since we can measure cortisol now.      Adrenal CrisisOftentimes, waiting 1-2 days for tests would be too late. Even thinking/behaviour can be affected and patient may not be able to tell you what’s going on.  Adrenal Crisis → also known as acute adrenal insufficiency.          This is a life threatening condition that needs immediate treatment.        Clinical Symptoms:          Dehydration, hypotension, shock                  Beware if these symptoms are out of proportion to the etiology           e.g. ending up in the ICU from a UTI                    Nausea, vomiting      History of weight loss, anorexia.      Abdominal pain (acute)      Unexplained fever/hypoglycaemia                  Cortisol involved in gluconeogenesis.                      Signs:          Hyperpigmentation/vitiligo      Other autoimmune features/family history thereof                  e.g. hypothyroidism, gonadal failure.                      Blood Tests:          Na+ ↓, K+ ↑, *Ca2+ ↑      Eosinophilia in CBC-D.      Renal insufficiency → elevated serum creatinine.      Etiologies of Adrenal Insufficiency  Addison’s Disease          Strictly speaking, this refers to only autoimmune AI, but some use it as an umbrella term for all AI.      If a patient says they have “Addison’s Disease”, you need to find out what exactly it really is.      Most common cause of Adrenal Insufficiency in the developed world.        Malignancy          Less likely, since it needs to spread to both adrenal glands to get insufficiency        Congenital adrenal hyperplasia  Tuberculosis          Can lead to chronic adrenal insufficiency if the adrenals are affected.      Most common in developing countries        Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome          This is a cause of acute adrenal insufficiency.      Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome → Adrenal failure by bleeding into the adrenals, due severe bacterial infection.        Hypopituitarism          Unlike the above causes, this one is secondary.        Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome      A cause of acute adrenal insufficiency, due to hemorrhage into the adrenals wtih severe bacterial sepsis.  Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is seen above.Screening of Adrenal Insufficiency  Screening Values                    Primary AI        Secondary AI                            Adrenal glands not producing cortisol        No stimulation of adrenal glands (ACTH)                    Na+ ↓        Na+ ↓/normal                    K+ ↑        K+ ↑                    HCO3- ↓        HCO3- ↓                    pH ↓                             Renal insufficiency                             Ca2+ ↑                             ACTH ↑        ACTH ↓/normal                    Aldosterone ↓        Aldosterone ↑              The electrolytes (Na+, K+), come back quickly, but the ACTH takes a while to come back.          Hence, it may be less convenient to diferentiate a primary and secondary source of adrenal insufficiency with the ACTH.        Another way to differentiate them is to use aldosterone.          With an adrenal problem, the production of aldosterone would go down.      With a central problem, aldosterone actually often goes up, because the low blood pressure stimulates RAAS.      Diagnosis of Adrenal Insufficiency  Diagnostic Tests for Adrenal Insufficiency      8 AM cortisol → Cortisol goes up in the morning, so if insufficient, the difference from normal will be very large (better sensitivity).    250 µg ACTH (cosyntropin) stimulation test → give ACTH analogue and see if cortisol rises    8 am serum ACTH → ACTH also goes up in the morning.    From the flowchart, we see that the best screening test to start with is the 8 AM cortisol.  Note that these are not the same tests as with Adrenal Overproduction.  Endocrinology is inconvenient in that the tests for overproduction and insufficiency are not the same.  To remember some of the timing differences between the tests for the two:          8 AM is the best time to measure low cortisol, because cortisol is highest in the morning.      11 PM is the best time to measure high cortisol, because cortisol is lowest at night.        Comparison of Tests for Adrenal Overproduction and Adrenal Insufficiency      Adrenal Overproduction:              24 Hour Urine Cortisol → test for high levels of cortisol.        1 mg Dexamethasone Suppression Test → test failure of suppression.        11 PM Salivary Cortisol → test for loss of diurnal rhythm (cortisol is normally low at night).              Adrenal Insufficiency:              8 AM Cortisol → test for low levels of cortisol (typically highest in AM).        250 µg ACTH (cosyntropin) Stimulation Test → test if production can be stimulated with ACTH.        8 AM Serum ACTH → test for low levels of ACTH (typically highest in AM too).            What Test is Best?  As we’ve already seen:          Primary AI → bad adrenals, resulting in low cortisol. Here, ACTH should be high due to lack of negative feedback on pituitary.      Secondary AI → bad central regulation (pituitary/hypothalamus), so ACTH should be low. However, even though adrenals are OK, there is no ACTH stimulation so cortisol is also low (which is why it’s a form of adrenal insufficiency).        One corollary is that the ACTH stimulation test is not enough to distinguish primary and secondary AI:           In secondary AI, a chronic lack of ACTH stimulation on the adrenals may make them atrophy, so you actually have both primary and secondary AI.       In this case, a stimulation test will return negative, which would usually suggest primary insufficiency, but would be missing the secondary insufficiency here.         The real best test is ACTH levels, or hyperpigmentation, which is related to ACTH production.          Recall that ACTH is produced from the gene POMC, which has multiple products, including MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone), which results in increased pigmentation.      This means that if we had a solitary primary adrenal insufficiency, where ACTH is high, then MSH would also be high, resulting in hyperpigmentation.        Remember      The ACTH stimulation test may not be effective in differentiating chronic secondary AI from primary AI, because chronic low ACTH causes the adrenals to atrophy.    The real best test for a primary adrenal insufficiency is the ACTH level, or hyperpigmentation.    Etiology of Primary vs. Secondary AI                    Primary        Secondary                            ACTH independent        ACTH dependent                    ACTH ↑        ACTH ↓                    Addison’s disease (umbrella term)        Hypopituitarism (more next week)                    Auto-immune        Look for other hormone deficiencies caused by hypopituitarism                    Tuberculosis        Consider prolonged glucocorticoid administration                    Congenital adrenal hyperplasia        e.g. &gt;2-3 weeks &amp; &gt;10 mg prednisone OD                    Other (e.g. hemorrhage, drugs, metastases)                     Treatment of AIAcute AI (Adrenal Crisis)  Do it fast  ABC’s  Get electrolytes, glucose  IV fluids (2-3L normal saline/dextrose) as quickly as possible          Use two large bore IVs (in case one fails)        Inject hydrocortisone (cortisol analogue) 100 mg IV bolus, followed by 50-100 mg Q 6-8 hours (Q = every)          Even when patients go home, give cortisol maintenance dose (15-20 mg) so they can inject themselves to avoid another crisis        Subacute measures:          Taper fluids and corticoids, start mineralocorticoid treatment (replenish aldosterone so they don’t lose the fluids all over again)      Search for cause and treat it      Chronic AIMaintenance therapy  Hydrocortisone (20 mg AM, 10 mg PM)          or (15 mg AM, 5 mg PM) if Cushing’s develops (too much cortisol)      or Prednisone 5-7.5 mg AM.        Florinef (fludrocortisone, an aldosterone analogue)          0.05 - 0.1 mg OD      Recall that fludrocortisone had 25 × the mineralicorticoid activity of aldosterone.      Not necessary for secondary AI (because aldosterone is not dependent on ACTH).      Not necessary for acute setting:                  Cortisol actually also binds to mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), so during acute AI treatment, high dose hydrocortisone treatment actually stimulates MR as well.          Cortisol may actually be better because if you have an excessive dose, it’ll be inactivated.                          Normally, there’s much more cortisol in body than aldosterone, but excess cortisol is inactivated (to cortisone) by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2), avoiding mineralocorticoid excess syndrome.                                Recall that 11β-HSD2 can be inhibited by licorice or drugs containing the active ingredient (glycyrrhetinic acid); so it can either be used to treat aldosterone deficiency or cause mineralocorticoid excess syndrome                    Stress dosing  When someone is stressed, they normally produce cortisol.  With adrenal insufficiency, this doesn’t happen, so you Nned to up the hydrocortisone in stressful situations.  Surgery (depends on type/duration)          Hydrocortisone 50-100 mg 1 hr before (when patient is “on call”), then 50-100 mg Q6-8 h → Similar to acute treatment.        Flu, exams for students, other stressful situations          3 by 3 → Increase dose 3x for 3 days.        If vomiting/severe diarrhea, hydrocortisone may not be absorbed orally          Need injection.

Although this is not common, it should not be missed since the consequences can be fatal.Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type I  One extra thing; just focus on the principles for this.  It’s an autoimmune disorder affecting many glands.

	{"title": "Pharmacology of Adrenal Hormones and Steroid Hormone Receptors", "text": "  Lots of stereochemistry today which you don’t need to commit to memory, but you should be aware of it.  This is because, like most other things in biology, the function of the corticosteroids (glucocorticoids, mineralicorticoids), depends on the structure.          Additional structural changes which allow specific molecular properties to be accentuated or reduced and these have been incorporated in a wide range of synthetic steroids for use clinically.      Steroid Structure &amp; Nomenclature  All steroids are based on 3 molecules.          Pregnane.      Androstane.      Estrane.        Numbering of steroids is based on the following (DON’T MEMORIZE THIS):          There are good biochemical reasons for why the chemical numbering is in that order.      But practically, it’s difficult to remember.        We have a double bond between C4 and C5, and double = d = delta in Greek.  So we call this a delta-4 steroid.  The carbon rings are very planar, making it so that steroids can easily slide through cell membranes.  Substituents can either be above or below the plane of the rings:          Above = β substituents.      Below = α substituents.        This is a bit hard to remember → alpha goes below, and beta goes above.  What’s shown in black in the above molecule is the minimum required structure to be a corticosteroid.  In red are some of the modifications that can be added to accentutate or suppress specific properties.          For instance, we can add a double bond at carbon-1 → delta-1 steroid.      Or we can add a fluorine at carbon 9, protruding downward. Hence it’s a 9-α-fluoro-steroid.        These various modifications can have a number of useful effects on:          The anti-inflammatory effec (the glucocorticoid effect).      The Na+ retaining potency (the mineralicorticoid effect).      Susceptibility to enzyme degradation.      Bioavailability and duraction.        These changes can be mediated by the following chemical changes (don’t need to know!).          Δ1 (double bond at C1):                  ↑ glucocorticoid effect, ↓ mineralicorticoid effect.                    6,α-Me (+ Δ1) (Double bond at C1 and CH3 protruding downwards at C6):                  ↑ glucocorticoid effect, ↓ mineralicorticoid effect.                    9,&amp;alpha-F (fluoride ion at C9, protruding downwards):                  ↑ glucocorticoid effect, ↑ mineralicorticoid effect.                    16-Me or 16-OH:                  ↔ glucocorticoid effect, ↓ mineralicorticoid effect.                    17,α-OH (OH group facing downwards at C17):                  ↑ glucocorticoid effect                      Glucocorticoids and mineralicorticoids can be differentiated by the presence of an O-11 (either =O or -OH):          If an O-11 is present, it’s a glucocorticoid.      If an O-11 isn’t present, it’s a mineralicorticoid.        So how come aldosterone is a potent mineralocorticoid when it has an O at position 11?          This formation with the O-11 is unstable.      In solution, it forms a hemiacetal form which attenuates the effect of the oxygen and makes it a very potent mineralicorticoid.      Activity of Corticosteroids  Here is a chart showing the activity of different corticosteroids relative to cortisol.          Short = 8-12 hours.      Intermediate = 12-36 hours.      Long = 36-72 hours.                  Compound      Anti-inflammatory      Na+ Retention      Duration                  Cortisol      1      1      Short              Cortisone      (0.8)      (0.8)      Short              Fludrocortisone      10      125      Short              Prednisone      4      0.8      Intermediate              Prednisolone      4      0.8      Intermediate              6α-methylprednisolone      5      0.5      Intermediate              Triamcinolone      5      0      Intermediate              Betamethasone      25      0      Long              Dexamethasone      25      0.01      Long        Why is cortisone listed as 0.8 when it’s an inactive hormone?          It’s listed as such because, even though it’s inactive, it can be converted to cortisol by 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.      So this is actually reflecting its effect as cortisol.        Hence, you can’t use cortisone topically, because skin doesn’t have 11-b-HSD!          So skin rash steroids will have cortisol, not cortisone (or prednisone).        Note that fludrocortisone seems to have a massive mineralicorticoid effect, but this is only relative to cortisol.          Cortisol is only cross-reactive with the mineralicorticoid receptor, so it’s mineralicorticoid effect is weak.      If aldosterone were on here, it’d have an effect of around 3000!        These activities make more sense when you look at their chemical structure:          Fludrocortisone is 9,􏰄α-fluorocortisol. It is used as a replacement mineralocorticoid.      Prednisone is 􏰁Δ1-cortisone; Prednisolone is 􏰁Δ1-cortisol.      Triamcinolone is 9,􏰄α-fluoro-16,􏰄α-hydroxyprednisolone      Dexamethasone is is 9,􏰄α-fluoro-16,􏰄α-methylprednisolone      Adverse Effects of Corticosteroids  Most adverse effects of corticosteroid use are extension effects.          Immuno-suppression might be a bad thing, for instance.        Some adverse effects include increased susceptibility to infection, edema, hypokalemic alkalosis, glycosuria, myopathy and muscle weakness, bone resorption (osteoporosis), growth inhibition (resistance to growth hormone), diabetes.  Continued administration of large doses may produce an iatrogenic Cushingoid syndrome.  Long term use inhibits the HP-adrenal axis, since cortisol is a negative regulator.          Sudden withdrawal of corticosteroids may thus result in an acute insufficiency.      Steroid Inhibitors  Ketoconazole:          Primary use is as an antifungal agent (hence the ___azole suffix).       However, at higher doses, it can inhibit adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis, by inhibiting certain activities of certain sytochromes.      It seems to be the most effective inhibitor of steroid biosynthesis in patients with Cushing’s syndrome.        Mitotane:          Not actually an inhibitor of synthesis per se; it actually causes destruction of the adrenal cortex tissue.      As a result, anything synthesized in the adrenal cortex goes down (aldosterone, cortisol, sex steroids).        Spironolactone:          Mineralicorticoid antagonist → recall Cardio and GU.      Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia  As an aside, Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by a mutation that results in a deficiency in 21-hydroxylase activity.  This ultimately results in excess formation of the adrenal androgens (DHEA and androstenedione), due to ‘shunting’ from blocked chemical pathways.  This can be seen below:Normal pathways of steroid synthesis in the adrenal cortex. Notice where 21-hydroxylase plays its role.In patients with CAH, you have an accumulation of progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, because the enzymatic reactions facilitated by 21-hydroxylase can't be done. Because of this, the equilibrium shifts towards the production of the adrenal androgens.  Hence, in patients with CAH, you have less mineralicorticoids and less glucocorticoids, and much more adrenal androgens          The adrenal androgens themselves are precursors for testosterone synthesis in the periphery, but are otherwise inactive.      They are the primary source of testosterone in females.        So, in females, CAH often results in fetal virilization and masculinization of the genitalia.  In males, there are little phenotypic 􏰁changes, except for acute salt wasting due to reduced aldosterone.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/endocrinology/2014/10/14/pharmacology-adrenal-glucocorticoids-mineralicorticoids-androgen-receptors.html"},
	{"title": "Physiology of Adrenal Hormones and Steroid Hormone Receptors", "text": "Lecture Objectives  Describe the canonical structure of steroid hormone receptors.  Outline the mechanism of action of steroid hormone receptors.  List the tissue distribution for each receptor and its subtypes.  Define the major actions of each steroid receptor.  Be able to integrate knowledge of steroid receptor (and subtype) distribution and ligand binding properties with both disease etiology and pharmacological intervention.Steroid Hormone Receptors  The receptors and intracellular enzymes that facilitate the downstream response are more important than the enzymes themselves.  The adrenals primarily secrete hormones in response to stress.          The hormones that are released function to increase the availability of energy (ATP).      The best way to do this is to increase blood glucose, which is the major role of cortisol.      Functional Anatomy of the Adrenal Glands  The adrenal glands are comprised of an outer cortex and an inner medulla.          Adrenal Cortex                  Source of adrenal steroids.          Responsive to pituitary stimulation by ACTH (hence adreno-cortico-tropic hormone).                          Recall that Hypothalamic CRH (Corticotropin Releasing Hormone) triggers the release of ACTH, which triggers cortisol release from the adrenal cortex.                                Different parts of the cortex release different hormones. The 3 major zones are:                          Zona glomerulosa → secretes aldosterone.              Zona fasciculata → secretes cortisol.              Zona reticularis → secretes sex steroids.                                          Adrenal Medulla                   Source of catecholamines, produced by chromaffin cells.                          Catecholamines are what result in the faster response to stress (recall, ↑HR, bronchodilation, skeletal muscle vasodilation, etc).                                Secretion is controlled by direct neuroendocrine innervation.                      Corticosteroids refer to two kinds of steroid hormones that are synthesized in the adrenal cortex:          Glucocorticoids → eg. cortisol, which is made in the zona fasciculata.                  Named ‘gluco’-corticoids because they regulate gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake.                    Mineralicorticoids → eg. aldosterone, which is made in the zona glomerulosa.                  Named ‘minerali’-corticoids because they regulate the absorption of Sodium, which is a mineral.                      Corticosteroids are one of two kinds of steroid hormones that are synthesized in the adrenal cortex:          Corticosteroids = glucocorticoids + mineralicorticoids.      Adrenal Androgens, which are made in the zona reticularis.        Adrenal Cortex vs Adrenal Medulla      The cortex produces steroids:              Zona glomerulosa → secretes aldosterone.        Zona fasciculata → secretes cortisol.        Zona reticularis → secretes sex steroids.              The medulla produces catecholamines:              Secreted by chromaffin cells which comprise the medulla.            Adrenal Steroidogenesis  The adrenal cortex is responsible for the synthesis of steroid hormones.  There are intracellular enzymes that convert one steroid hormone to another.          These are cytochrome P450s → also known as the CYPs, eg. CYP17. Both naming schemes are interchangeable.      These cytochrome P450s are primarily found in the membranes of mitochondria and ER.      Key concept → it’s the relative ratio. of these enzymes in the target tissues that determines the effect of a steroid, because that’ll determine the end distribution of hormone.      Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis  As seen before, this a classic negative-feedback loop, similar to that with the thyroid.          Trigger is a stress → fear, cold, hypoglycemia.      Hypothalamus produces CRH.      Anterior pituitary produces ACTH in response.      Adrenal cortex produces cortisol, resulting in gluconeogenesis, muscle catabolism (producing amino acids), and inhibition of GLUT-4 (preventing glucose uptake into cells).      Cortisol negatively regulates CRH and ACTH levels.      The ACTH Receptor  the ACTH receptor is a GPCR coupled to cAMP.  Promotes the activity of Cholesterol Ester Hydrolase.          Converts cholesterol esters into cholesterol, which is necessary for the production of steroid hormones.        Rapidly increases production of StAR (the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis).          StAR = Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein → mobilizes cholesterol into mitochondria for further steroid hormone production.        So ACTH binding (1) increases creation of cholesterol and (2) increases movement of cholesterol into the mitochondria for steroid production.  These receptors are located primarily in zona reticularis and fasiculata, where cortisol and sex hormones are produced, respectively.Cortisol Transport &amp; Metabolism  Just like with the amino acid derivatives like thyroid hormone, Cortisol must be bound to a carrier protein for transport.  Just like TBG (Thyroxine binding globulin), with cortisol, we have CBG (Corticosteroid binding globulin).          75% of the cortisol in the plasma is bound to CBG (Corticosteroid Binding Globulin, aka. Transcortin). Don’t worry about the numbers, just remember that CBG is the dominant binding protein.      15% is bound to HSA (Human Serum Albumin).      10% is ‘free’ (at the end tissue destination) and biologically active.      ACTH and Cortisol Release  Cortisol release follows ACTH release, as expected.  They have both ultradian and diurnal rhythms.          We have an early morning spike in ACTH → Cortisol production.      But we also have regular patterns within each day of ACTH and cortisol production as well.      Steroid Hormone Receptors  Steroid hormone receptors are transcription factors, so their targets are genomic loci where they turn on/off specific genes.          They bind lipid soluble ligands in the cytosol.      They then move into the nucleus where they bind to specific genes.        Steroid hormone receptors have particular components:          Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) → binds the hormone.      DNA Binding Domain (DBD) → binds the genomic target. These targets are known as HREs (Hormone Response Elements).      Activation Function Domains (AFs) → interact with activating proteins.      Repression Domains (RDs) → interact with repressing proteins.      Nuclear Localization Sequence (NLS) → since the receptor has to get into the nucleus to bind its tarets.      Glucocorticoid &amp; Mineralicorticoid Receptors  We’ll primarily be focusing on glucocorticoid receptors and mineralicorticoid receptors.          Cortisol binds the Glucocorticoid Receptor.      Aldosterone binds the Mineralicorticoid Receptor.        However, there’s a vast number of receptor types, including ones that bind T3/T4, etc.  The ligand binding domains of these steroid receptors are often very similar.          This often means that we can have cross-reactivity of steroids with different hormone receptors.      For instance, glucocorticoids can bind the mineralicorticoid receptor, and vice versa.      Mineralicorticoid Receptor  Single isoform.  Largest of steroid hormone receptors.  Widely expressed in kidney, colon, heart, central nervous system (hippocampus), brown adipose tissue and sweat glands.  Natural ligands are aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone.  Many ligands are synthetic.  Regulates water/salt balance through activation of the distal tubule sodium channel and CNS actions to increase thirst.Glucocorticoid Receptor  Single isoform.  Expressed in all tissues.  Natural ligands include cortisol and cortisone.  Synthetic ligands well-known e.g. hydrocortisone, betamethasasone, dexamethasone etc.  Regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis, hepatic amino acid mobilization, inhibition of glucose uptake in muscle and fat (via inhibition of GLUT-4, recall), immune suppression (anti-inflammatory, like the steroids we give to patients), and maturation of the fetal lung.  Glucocorticoid vs Mineralicorticoid Receptor                             Glucocorticoid Receptor        Mineralicorticoid Receptor                            Natural Ligands        Cortisol, Cortisone        Aldosterone                    Location        Kidney, colon, heart, CNS, brown adipose tissue, sweat glands        All tissues                    Downstream Effects        (1) Hepatic gluconeogenesis(2) inhibition of GLUT-4 (↓ glucose uptake)(3) immune suppression(4) maturation of the fetal lung.        Regulation of water/salt balance via sodium channel regulation and CNS effects to increase thirst            Clinical Relevance of Cortisol Levels      We’ll be focusing here on cortisol only, since aldosterone is regulated outside of the pituitary via the RAAS system.Discovered by Thomas Addison, and Harvey Cushing, respectively.    The main diseases we’re dealing with are:          Addison’s Disease → Hypocortisolism.      Cushing’s Disease → Hypercortisolism.Some people refer to these enzymes as CYPs, others refer to them as P450, but it’s all the same.        We saw that both aldosterone and cortisol arise from a common precursor (cholesterol), and are produced via different enzymatic reactions (the CYP enzymes).  Depending on where you inhibit the hormone synthesis pathway, we can inhibit the production of different hormones.          In some cases we can inhibit both mineralicorticoids and glucocorticoids, or even the sex steroids as well!      The various pharmaceutical inhibitors and where they block these enzymatic pathways are shown below.        Hypocortisolism or hypercortisolism is clinically relevant because they have a number of effects:  Cortisol itself is a stress hormone, and causes the following:          Increases serum glucose and amino acids:                  ↑ protein metabolism to increase free amino acids.          ↑ amino acid uptake in the liver → increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis.          ↓ peripheral glucose uptake → increased circulating glucose.                    Increased Lipid and Bone Catabolism:                  ↑ lipid hydrolysis → increased circulating fatty acids.          ↑ bone and connective tissue catabolism → osteopenia, thinning of the skin and support structures.                    Enhances electrolyte and water balance:                  IMPORTANT: This isn’t a primary effect; it’s a consequence of cross-reactivity with the mineralicorticoid receptor.          ↑ Na+ reabsorption at the distal tubule. Recall that we saw this with the principal cell and α-intercalating cell in GU.          ↑ K+ excretion, H+ secretion (hypokalemia, alkalosis).                    Opposes the action of insulin:                  Will be important next week.                    11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  The last point above about how cortisol is cross-reactive with the mineralicorticoid receptor (MR) brings up an important issue.          Even though aldosterone binds the MR with much higher affinity, cortisol is present in the circulation in 100× the concentration.      So if you have too much cortisol, you can actually end up with a pronounced mineralicorticoid effect.        In order to protect the body from this, specific tissues express a particular enzyme called 11β-hydroxycorticosteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD), which can inactive cortisol, by converting it into cortisone.  More specifically, there are 2 isoforms of the 11β-hydroxycorticosteroid dehydrogenase enzyme.          11β-HSD-1, which converts inactive cortisone into active cortisol.      11β-HSD-2, which converts active cortisol into inactive cortisone.        So isoform 1 is an activating enzyme and isoform 2 is an inactivating enzyme. Of course, the inactivating enzyme is particularly important.  These two isoforms are located in different regions:          11β-HSD-1 is expressed mainly in the liver.      11β-HSD-2 is expressed mainly in the kidney.        Hence, cortisol is activated in the liver, and inactivated in the kidney.  Inherited errors in structure or expression of 11β-HSD-2 cause a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME).          This is because blocking inactivation of cortisol into cortisone leads to lots of active glucocorticoid, which can bind the mineralicorticoid receptor.      This primarily results in hypertension.        Dutch black licorice, which we saw in Genitourinary, contains Glycyrrhizic acid, which is a potent inhibitor of 11β-HSDs, and thus can also leads to symptoms of AME.  11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase      11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase exists in two isoforms:              11β-HSD-1:                      Converts inactive cortisone into active cortisol.            Primarily located in the liver.                          11β-HSD-2                      Converts active cortisol into inactive cortisone.            Primarily located in the kidney.                                11β-HSD-2 is also expressed in the placenta:          The idea is that, in pregnancy, the mother makes a lot more cortisol than the baby.      Cortisol can flow into the placenta, and fetal hypercortisolism can lead to intrauterine growth restriction, and pre-eclampsia.      To protect against this, the placenta expresses the inactivating 11β-HSD-2, to convert the cortisol into cortisone, and relieve the load on the fetus.

The superior thyroid originates from the fourth pharyngeal pouch  The inferior thyroid originates from the third pharyngeal pouch  Descends during fetal development to its final position.  Sometimes a tract is left behind during the descent, which becomes the pyramidal lobe.          This pyramidal lobe can sometimes cause disease and may require surgical excision.

	{"title": "Thyroid/Parathyroid Focal Cases", "text": "Case #1  Case Summary  A 50-year old woman presents with a 6-month history of weight loss (40 lbs) despite a voracious appetite, severe palpitations, and uncontrollable shakiness. She feels very hot and sweaty and can’t get to sleep at night.  Upon examination, the following is discovered. Her heart rate is 130/min and her blood pressure is 138/90. Her skin is warm, velvety and moist and there is a fine tremor of her hands. She has a noticeable stare and lid lag as well as chemosis and scleral injection. Her thyroid is diffusely enlarged and meaty with loud systolic and diastolic bruits over both lobes. There is a Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the aortic area.  Laboratory investigations reveal the following:      TSH &lt; 0.10 mU/L (0.3-4.5)    Free T4 51 pmol/L (9-22)    Note: there’s a subtle difference between hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis.          Hyperthryoidism → an overactive thyroid gland.      Thyrotoxicosis → high blood levels of thyroid hormone.        So thyroiditis would be thyrotoxicosis, not hyperthyroidism, since the thyroid isn’t overactive, it’s just inflammed.Questions  What diagnosis is most consistent with the above history?          Hyperthyrodism.        Name 4 thyroid conditions that can cause an elevated FT4 and FT3.          Graves’ Disease.      Toxic Adenoma → one nodule in the thyroid.      Toxic Multinodular Goiter → multiple nodules in the thyroid.      Thyroiditis → inflammation of the thyroid gland, causing a release of thyroid hormones.        What is the most likely cause of her elevated FT4 and FT3? Justify your conclusions from the history, physical exam and lab tests.          Graves’ Disease.      Female, middle aged, consistent with Graves.      Ocular symptoms → stare and lid lag.                  Eye symptoms due to antibody attack of the extra-ocular muscles.                    Diffuse, homogeneous enlargement.        a) What other test(s) would or could you order to confirm the diagnosis? b) What additional information would the(se) test(s) provide?          Radioactive Iodine Scan → to differentiate between Graves’ (diffuse uptake) versus a toxic adenoma (focal uptake).      Antibodies → specific for Graves’ disease. Usually not necessary, if history is suggestive. Recall, that this is only used in pregnancy, when radioactive iodine is contraindicated.        List two mechanisms involved in producing her cardiovascular symptoms and signs.          Increased heart rate and contractility because of increased catecholamine sensitivity.      Tremors also due to increased sympathetic activity.        What treatment would you recommend to this lady? List the common side- effects of these treatments and consider any limitations in the quality of life of this patient because of their administration. Consider the variation in the administration of these drugs internationally. (United States, Europe, Japan, etc).          Methimazole → first line treatment.      Propylthiouracil → second line, except in the first trimester of pregnancy.                  Worried about Methimazole in the first trimester for teratogenic effects, so Propylthiouracil is used in the first trimester only, and then switched to Methimazole.                    Rare risk of agranulocytosis → a rare and dangerous side effect.      Rare risk of liver toxicity → higher with propylthiouracil.      Medication is used most as 1st line treatment in Canada.      Surgery is used more in Europe.      Radioactive Iodine Ablation is used most in the US.                  Not used in Japan → obvious stigma with radiation.          Contraindicated in pregnancy.          They usually also trigger radiation alarms in airports for a few months after treatment!                    Drugs are used most in Japan.        Could she have a diagnosis of Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis? Why or why not?          No. Even though you have a transient hyperthyroidism due to release of the thyroid hormone from destroyed cells, it wouldn’t have lasted 6 months.      She would have hypothyroidism by now if it was Hashimoto’s.      Case #2  Case Summary  A 26-year old female complains of palpitations that have been constant over the past two weeks but seem worse at night. She states that they are regular and it feels as if her heart is going to jump out of her chest. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. She recently delivered a normal baby boy during an uncomplicated delivery 5 1⁄2 weeks before this visit. She has been feeling a bit warm lately, and complains of feeling tired but being unable to get a good night sleep. Her review of systems was remarkable for loose stools occurring approximately 4 times/day. She feels that her mind is racing and denies heat or cold intolerance.  Upon physical examination, her blood pressure was 146/90 and her pulse was 96. She showed a fine tremor of the hands. Her thyroid was approximately 1.5 times normal in size, symmetrically enlarged, firm, non-tender with carotids palpable bilaterally without bruits.  Lab Investigations:      FT4 16.2 (9-22)    TSH &lt;0.05 (0.3 – 4.5)  Questions  What is the state of her thyroid function?          Subclinical Hyperthyroidism.      Why is her TSH still low, even though her Free T4 is normal?                  There’s a lag time for the TSH to normalize, so maybe she only just recently had overt hyperthyroidism.          Symptoms seem to agree with this.                      What is the likeliest cause of the thyroid problem?          Post-partum thyroiditis.        She denies feeling depressed and you are not sure whether the clinical presentation warrants a more thorough investigation of her mental state. Should you investigate more thoroughly? Investigate the correlation between depression and your proposed diagnosis in this patient population.          Still no good evidence suggestive of a link between post-partum depression and post-partum thyroiditis.        What other investigations should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis?          None → post-partum thyroiditis is a clinical diagnosis.      We can’t do a radioactive iodine scan, because it’s contraindicated in breast-feeding mothers.      She also seems to be recovering already.        Describe and discuss the clinical and laboratory presentation of this disorder. Ensure that you understand the natural history of this disorder.          Post-partum thyroiditis usually gets better on its own.      About a third of women will go hyperthyroid → euthyroid.      Another third of women will go hyperthyroid → hypothyroid → euthyroid.      A final third of women will go hypothyroid → euthyroid.      However, a quarter to half of all of these will end up with chronic hypothyroidism after 10 years.        What would you do to treat this patient? Is treatment required?          Follow up with her until recovery.      No treatment is required.        What does this mean for her future management?          Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal antibodies may develop after.                  Recall that these were signs of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.                    So they may have hypothyroidism down the line.      Case #3  Case Summary  A 60-year-old lady presents with a 6-month history of weight gain (despite a poor appetite), cold intolerance, dry skin and hair, hoarseness of the voice and generalized puffiness. Lately she had developed retrosternal heaviness with minimal activity relieved by rest.  On examination, her skin was cool and dry with generalized edema. Oral temperature is 36.3 ̊C. Heart rate is 52 BPM. Blood pressure is 140/90. The thyroid was diffusely enlarged and firm. There was dullness at the right lung base with decreased vocal and tactile fremitus. Heart sounds were barely audible. The relaxation phase of the reflexes was delayed and there was pseudomyotonia on striking the deltoids.  Pseudomyotonia → delayed relaxation of the muscles.  What one test would you do to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism?          TSH.        Describe and discuss the two major mechanisms involved in the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism, giving 3 examples of each that this lady had.          Slowing of the metabolic processes:                  Cold intolerance.          Reduced heart rate.          Weight gain.                    Accumulation of glycosaminoglycans:                  Edema, puffiness.          Hoarseness.                      a) How would you treat this woman’s hypothyroidism? b) *Describe why you would choose that particular treatment regimen?          Synthroid. orally.      Start low, go up slowly.        What would you do about the enlarged firm goitre?          Nothing, unless it’s a high risk nodule.      If not responsive to treatment, do an ultrasound to look for nodules.      Recall that you should avoid unnecessarily going for an ultrasound, because you have to follow them down the entire diagnostic chain, if you find an incidental nodule.      Case #4  Case Summary  A 68-year-old man is critically ill in the Intensive Care Unit. His thyroid function tests reveal the following:      TSH: 1.0 mU/L (0.3-4.5).    FT4: 8.0 mmol/L (9-22).    FT3: 1.5 mmol/L (3.5-6.5).    You think that his thyroid indices can be explained by Non-Thyroidal Illness (NTI), since they are critically ill, with a normal TSH, but low FT4 and FT3.Questions  Research and discuss the characteristics of NTI.          NTI = Non-thyroidal Illness.      The thyroid isn’t really dysfunctional, it’s just as a consequence of the patient’s critical illness.      Two mechanisms:                  There’s an increased conversion to reverse T3 instead of FT3, resulting in lower FT3 levels.          The pituitary is less responsive to low FT3 and FT4.                      What is Euthyroid Sick Syndrome? Explore this and NTI in terms of prevalence and what they mean for patients.          They’re pretty much the same → they’re synonyms.      Increased prevalence with severely ill patients.      What happens when you get better? Your thyroid hormone levels go back to normal; if not, then there is an underlying issue.        Discuss whether these responses are adaptive or maladaptive.          The levels seen in NTI       Still controversial → some people believe that a decreased metabolic rate is an adaptation to reduce bodily maintenance needs in patients that are critically ill.      Other people believe that this response isn’t normal, and it’s actually maladaptive.      Case #5  Case Summary  A 44-year-old woman recently immigrated from Iraq presents with goitre. She does not have drug coverage.Questions  What issues need to be considered with this presentation and this patient?          Questions → symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.      Iodine deficiency.      PTU will actually be covered for her, but Methimazole isn’t in ODB.      So the issue of drug coverage is big.        Discuss international health issues and the idea of an ‘endemic goitre’. Which immigrant populations are largely affected by this phenomenon?          Worry about regions with low iodine.      Inland areas where soil and water lacks in iodine compounds and consumption of marine foods is low are known for higher incidence of goitre.        What investigations would you do on this patient? Why?          History and physical exam → look for signs of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.      Obstructive Symptoms → hoarseness, dysphagia, etc.        Discuss what you think might be the patient’s objectives in seeing you. What concerns may patients have that cause them to see a physician for a goitre?          Because they have a huge, ugly lump in their neck.      They might have compressive symptoms, or symptoms of hypo/hyperthyroidism.        What management plan would you develop for this patient?          Hx, P/E.      Thyroid tests → TSH.      Subsequent management based on this.        On a follow-up visit, you discover that the patient has ended up taking an herbal preparation rich in Iodine. What should you consider now in terms of thyroid function? How will your management of the patient change?          Iodine can cause both hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.                  Recall the Wolff-Chaikoff effect and the Jod-Basedow phenomenon.                    Should repeat history, physical exam, and thyroid tests.        Upon further reading on this topic, you discover that there are variations in the thyroid function in goitre. Research and discuss the Wolff-Chaikoff effect and the Jod-Basedow phenomenon (this is particularly applicable to the ingestion of the iodine load in our patient).          Wolff‐Chaikoff Effect:                  A physiological response where you decrease thyroid hormone production in the presence of an iodine load.          Normal people ‘escape’ the W‐C effect and then achieve a new steady state of Euthyroidism.          Those with underlying, subclinical Hashimoto’s may fail escape, but will instead become hypothyroid.                    Jod‐Basedow phenomenon                  Jod = Iodine, Basedow = German physician who described autoimmune hyperthyroidism ~ the same time as Graves did.          This is seen in patients with underlying autonomous thyroid tissue (toxic nodules) or mild subclinical Graves’.          Here, they do not experience Wolff‐Chaikoff, but instead their thyroid uses an iodine load to make too much hormone, causing hyperthyroidism.                    Case #6  Case Summary  A 35-year-old woman noticed a lump on the right side of her neck when she was brushing her teeth. She noticed it moved up and down when she swallowed and found that she experienced some difficulty swallowing solids and liquids. However, she has not experienced any change in her voice or other discomfort. She does note that the mass seems to have enlarged since the discovery. She has lost 20 lbs in weight over the past 6 months despite a good appetite. She has otherwise been well and denies any other symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism. There is no family history of thyroid disease.Questions  Describe the four methods in which you could investigate this nodule.          TSH → if it’s a hot nodule (low TSH), then it’s less likely to be cancer than with a cold nodule.      Ultrasound → look for nodules, size.      Radioactive Uptake Sign → look for localization, whether it’s a hot/cold nodule.      FNAB → to get a diagnostic result (benign/malignant).        You perform a Fine Needle Aspiration that is read as “indeterminate”. What does this mean to you and the patient?          It means you didn’t get enough cells, or they’re too clumped together.      You have to do the biopsy again.        What is the sensitivity and specificity of these tests?          Both the sensitivity and specificity are pretty high.      Unless it’s an indeterminate sample.        How do pathologists arrive at the diagnosis of thyroid cancer?          They do some magic voodoo stuff when they look at the cells.      Recall the diagnostic features we saw from Clinical Presentation &amp; Evaluation of Thyroid Disease.                       Key Points     Key Diagnostic Features             Papillary     Most common, indolent     Nuclear features.           Follicular     Second most common     Partially encapsulated, but with invasion           Anaplastic     Universally lethal     Very poorly differentiated           Medullary     Involves the parafollicular cells     Extracellular pink material, immunohistochemical staining against calctionin.         How would you manage this young woman’s condition?          Repeat the FNAB again.      Hemithyroidectomy, if it’s still an indeterminate lesion.        After your initial examination, your patient has researched her condition on the internet and now harbours numerous ‘internet fears’. How will you quell these fears? Anticipate your patient’s concerns and address these within your groups.          She might be worried about incision to neck, or anesthesia.      If the biopsy was indeterminate, she may be worried that the surgery may be unnecessary.      Find out what their needs are, what they’re worried about, blah blah blah.      Case #7  Case Summary  A 47-year old woman you diagnosed with Graves’ opts for a total thyroidectomy due to her large thyroid size. 5 days post-op she is brought into hospital after having a seizure. Her family mentions that 2 days prior she had been complaining of “pins and needles” in her fingers and toes, and around her lips.  Her laboratory findings are:      TSH: 2.4 mU/L (0.3-4.5).    Ca: 1.84 mmol/L (2.12-2.62).    Albumin: 40 g/L (35-50).    Na: 137 mmol/L (135-145).    K: 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-4.5).    Glucose: 4.8 (3.6-6.3).    Everything’s normal, except for her low calcium.  What would you say about her calcium if her albumin.          Correct calcium by albumin level (since calcium binds to albumin in the body).      Since her albumin is normal, this is true hypocalcemia.      Questions  She is now awake and alert after recovering from her seizure. What are two clinical signs can you examine for?          Chvostek’s Sign → sign of nerve hyperexcitability (tetany) seen in hypocalcemia.                  When the facial nerve is tapped at the angle of the jaw, the facial muscles on the same side of the face will contract momentarily, due to nerve hyperexcitability.          This is not very specific → up to 15% of normal people will have a positive sign.                    Trousseau’s Sign → believed to be more sensitive than the Chovstek sign, and may become positive at an earlier stage of hypocalcemia.                   Put a blood pressure cuff around the patient’s arm and inflate it to a pressure of about 20-30 above the systolic and hold it there for 3 minutes.          Occlusion of the brachial artery stops blood flow to the arm, and the patient’s hypocalcemia leads to characteristic muscle contraction that can be seen to the right.          Also known as the ‘main d’accoucheur’ → french for ‘Hand of the Obstetrician’, because it looks like the position of an obstetrician’s hand when delivering a baby.                     Hyperreflexia → increased deep tendon reflexes.        What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?          Accidental excision of her parathyroid glands during her thyroidectomy.      Parathyroid glands are small, and easily missed.        What other lab investigation(s) would confirm the etiology of her hypocalcemia?          PTH → should be ↓.      Ca → should be ↓.      Vitamin D → should be ↓.      Phosphate → should be ↑ (since PTH promotes phosphate excretion from the kidney).      If the patient had pseudohypoparathyroidism, where they’re PTH resistant, intuitively, the only change would be that their PTH would be high.        How would these lab values differ if the patient had Vitamin D deficiency?          If the patient was deficient in Vitamin D, then their PTH would be high, and not low, because the parathyroids would try to increase serum calcium.      The calcium and Vitamin D would still be low.      Since we do have PTH, we have phosphate excretion from the kidney. Hence the phosphate is lower with Vitamin D deficiency than with a parathyroid problem.        How would you manage her acutely?          Give her calcium.      Calcium gluconate.        What do you tell her about her long-term management?          Her hypoparathyroidism could be short-term (stunning of the parathyroid due to strain on the blood supply), or it could be permanent.      If it’s permanent, she may need long-term calcium and Vitamin D (to improve absorption) supplementation.      It’s better to target the serum calcium level to the low side of normal, to try and stimulate the parathyroids in case they are only transiently stunned.                  It’s also a good idea to reduce the risk of kidney stones.                    Note → unlike with thyroid hormone replacement, recombinant PTH isn’t used in hypoparathyroidism.                  Even though this makes sense physiologically, it’s not done because it’s (1) expensive, and (2) injected.          It’s only indicated for osteoporosis at the moment.                    Levothyroxine is also needed because of her thyroidectomy.      ", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.schulichnotes.com/endocrinology/2014/10/09/thyroid-parathyroid-focal-cases.html"},
	{"title": "Metabolic Bone Disease", "text": "  Metabolic Bone Disease Notes      See Metabolic Bone Disease Notes.  Lecture Objectives  Describe the pathophysiology of osteomalacia, osteoporosis and Paget’s Disease.   Describe therapeutic options for osteomalacia, osteoporosis and Paget’s Disease. Osteomalacia  Definition: A defect in bone matrix mineralization.           In childhood, prior to the closure of the epiphyseal plates, this leads to rickets.      In adults it is known as osteomalacia.         A child with rickets can be seen to the right.Clinical Features  Mineralization defects result in weak bones and fractures.   Proximal muscle weakness (myopathy) can be severe, leading to falls.  Malabsorption syndromes (celiac disease patients) often also have or develop osteomalacia.Pathophysiology  Osteomalacia has several etiologies such as:          Vitamin disorders → Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause.      Mineral deficiencies      Disorders of bone matrix      Inhibitors of bone mineralization       1. Vitamin Disorders  Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption.  Main source is sunlight.    Calcium intake can prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism and reduce bone resorption.  Older individuals have difficulties getting enough Vitamin D.  Broadly speaking Vitamin D intake can be limited by:          Impaired formation or processing of Vitamin D.      Lack of sunlight exposure.      Inadequate Vitamin D intake .      Inconsistent patient compliance with Vitamin D.      Drug metabolism interference.        Causes of decreased Vitamin D include:          Insufficient sunlight exposure.      Nutritional deficiency.      Malabsorption.      Hydroxylation defects.      Nephrotic Syndrome.      Liver Disease (unable to perform the 25-hydroxylation).      Chronic Renal Failure (unable to perform the 1α-hydroxylation).      Anticonvulsant Therapy.        Clinical Note: Daily intake of Vitamin D      The new 2010 recommended daily allowance (RDA) is 600 IU for those 1-70 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women, and 800 IU for those over 71 years of age.     An adequate blood level of vitamin D is 20ng/mL, which can be achieved through daily skin exposure to sunlight.    Multivitamin pills may contain 200-400 IU    Calcium tablet containing vitamin D may have from 120 to 400 IU    Supplements contain 400 and 1000 IU / tablet  2. Mineral Deficiencies  Calcium deficiency.  Adults require 1000mg-1200mg of calcium a day &gt;19 years of age  Phosphate deficiency → decreased GI absorption or increased renal loss3. Disorders of Bone Matrix  Nothing more was said on this topic, just know it can play into the etiology of osteomalacia.4. Inhibitors of Bone Mineralization  Aluminum.  Bisphosphonates.          Bisphosphonates function to reduce bone turnover, but first generation bisphosphonates like etidronate actually inhibit mineralization if used for too long.      A Clinical Approach to OsteomalaciaHistory  Dietary history.  Alcohol history.  Significant weight loss within the last 6 months.          &gt; 10% loss of body weight.      Either % ideal weight or % usual weight.      Beware of patients with ascites/oedema, which adds weight (think of cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension).      Investigations for Osteomalacia  Laboratory: ↓Ca, ↓ PO4, ↑alkaline phosphatase, ↓ urinary Ca.  Radiology: Looser-Milkman pseudofractures → thought to be healed microfractures   Bone biopsy: usually not necessary but considered gold standard.Treatment for Osteomalacia  Depends on the underlying cause.  Vitamin D supplementation.  PO4 supplements if low PO4.  Ca supplements if low Ca.Paget’s Disease  Definition: A metabolic disease characterized by excessive bone destruction and repair; a localized disorder of bone remodeling.Clinical Features  Usually asymptomatic → routine X-ray finding or elevated alkaline phosphatase   Severe bone pain → pelvis, femur, tibia from lytic lesions that heal into sclerotic areas  Skeletal deformities → bowed tibia (saber shins), kyphosis, frequent fractures   Skull involvement → headaches, increased hat size, deafness, frontal bossing   Increased warmth over involved bones due to increased vascularitySome of the key clinical findings in Paget's disease, due to the accelerated breakdown and regrowth of bone. Top left: lytic lesions that heal into sclerotic areas. Top right: skull enlargement. Bottom left: frontal bossing. Bottom right: saber shins (bowed tibias).  Clinical Note: Paget’s Disease      Paget’s disease is very common: affecting 5% of the population as a whole and 10% of the population &gt; 80 years of age.     Second most common bone disease after osteoporosis   Pathophysiology  Initiated by increased osteoclastic activity leading to increased bone resorption.   Osteoblastic activity increases in response to produce new bone that is structurally abnormal and fragile.   Initiated by localized increases in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption with subsequent compensatory osteoblast increases in bone formation.  Results in a disorganized mosaic of woven and lamellar bone   This structural change produces bone that is:           expanded in size.      less compact.      more vascular.      more susceptible to deformity or fracture.      Investigations for Paget’s Disease  Laboratory:           ↑↑↑ alkaline phosphatase      Alkaline Phosphatase is a marker of bone resorption!      Normal or ↑ Ca, normal PO4.      ↑ Urinary hydroxyproline (indicates lots of bone resorption).        Imaging:           Evaluate extent of disease with bone scan       Initial lesion may be destructive and radiolucent.      Involved bones are expanded and denser that normal.      Multiple fissure fractures in long bones.        Remember      Alkaline Phosphatase is a marker of bone resorption!    Hence, patients with Paget’s disease will have very high alkaline phosphatase levels.  Complications of Paget’s Disease  Fractures.  Hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis (kidney stones).  Cranial nerve compression if skull involvement → deafness.  Spinal cord compression.  Osteosarcoma (1-3%) indicated by marked bone pain, new lytic lesions and increased alkaline phosphatase.  High output congestive heart failure due to increased vascularity.Treatment of Paget’s Disease  Treat the symptoms → analgesias for pain relief   Bone protection → bisphosphonates → alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate.          Unlike osteomalacia, where the issue is that the bones are too soft, here it’s that the bone turnover is too high.      Hence, where in osteomalacia, bisphosphonates are contraindicated, since they inhibit mineralization somewhat, here they’re critical, since they reduce turnover.         Calcitonin.OsteoporosisOsteoporosis  Definition: A progressive systemic skeletal disease characterized by decreased bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to increased in bone fragility and risk of fracture. Clinical Features  Commonly asymptomatic   Pain, usually backache   Height loss → collapsed vertebrae, kyphosis   Fractures → hip, vertebrae, wrist   Clinical Note: Osteoporosis      1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men &gt; 50 years of age have osteoporosis    Total of 1.4 million Canadians are affected by osteoporosis and 2 million people are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis     &lt; 20% of people who fracture go on to be assessed for osteoporosis (more than 79% are not diagnosed or treated for osteoporosis)    Of the 30,000 hip fractures per year in Canada,70% are due to osteoporosis    Mortality rate is 20% higher than average within one year of hip fracture    By age 80, half of all women will have a vertebral fracture    &lt;&lt; 500 grams of Ca (bone mass) is the threshold for fracture   Pathophysiology  Over time, both men and women lose bone mass.   RANK ligand is released from osteoblasts, and it functions to initiate precursor osteoclasts to mature.  When PTH increases, it stimulates the release of RANK ligand from osteoblasts, increasing the number of osteoclasts, and hence the resorption of calcium.  Estrogen binds RANK ligand, limiting it’s release and hence limiting resorption by osteoclasts.          As a result, women lose bone mass faster than men due to menopause, because they no longer produce estrogen.      Men are able to maintain bone mass longer than women due to testosterone conversion to estrogen and because they have a larger amount of bone mass to lose.      Clinical Note: Osteoporosis Primary vs. Secondary  Primary Osteoporosis:           Usually in women, within 20 years of menopause.      Typically due to the mechanism described above; estrogen binds RANKL, so without estrogen production, osteoclast resorption increases.      Affects mainly trabecular bone.        Secondary Osteoporosis:           Endocrinopathies                   Hyperparathyroidism.          Hyperthyroidism.          Premature menopause or in men hypogonadism .          Diabetes (this is still in up in the air).                    Malignancy       Gastrointestinal disease       Drugs                   steroids           phenytoin                     Other                   Rheumatoid arthritis           Renal disease           Poor nutrition                     Fragility Fractures in Osteoporosis  Definition: A fracture that occurs spontaneously or following a minor trauma such as:          Fall from standing position (e.g. walking on ice)      Fall from sitting position      Fall from bed (&lt; 1 metre high)      Fall after having missed 1–3 steps in a staircase      After a movement outside of the typical plane of motion      From coughing      Risk Factors for Fractures  Fragility fracture after the age of 40  Parental history of hip fracture  Premature menopause  Glucocorticoid use (&gt; 7.5 mg/d) &gt; 3 months in the prior year   Lifestyle factors: smoking, excessive alcohol, and physical inactivity  Weight loss since age 25 &gt;10%  Poor nutrition, calcium intake, vitamin D status  Recurrent fallsInvestigations for Osteoporosis  Laboratory: Ca, PO4, alkaline phosphatase are usually normal unless secondary osteoporosis  Imaging: Bone densitometry.          Dual xray absorptiometry (DEXA) most useful but single energy xray absorptiometry, ultrasound and quantitative CT also used.      Lumbar spine and femur sites tested and compared to controls.      Treatment of Osteoporosis  Prevention and lifestyle modifications:           Weight bearing exercise.      Calcium → Total daily intake of Ca supplementation to 1200 mg/day.      Vitamin D → 400-1000 IU/day if &lt; 50 years of age, 800-2000IU/day. if &gt; 50 years of age*.      Limit smoking and alcohol.         Measures to decrease further bone loss or resorption:          Bisphosphonates → inhibitors of osteoclast       Denosumab → monoclonal antibody against RANK ligand and inhibits osteoclasts       Selective estrogen receptor modulators → SERM’s       Postmenopusal estrogen replacement.      Calcitonin → decreases osteoclast activity.        Measures to increase bone mass:          Recombinant parathyroid hormone → teriparatide.      Teriparatide is identical to a portion of human parathyroid hormone (PTH) and intermittent use activates osteoblasts more than osteoclasts, which leads to an overall increase in bone.

	{"title": "Physiology &amp; Pathology of the Parathyroids", "text": "Lecture Objectives  List physiological processes requiring calcium.  Outline the major organ systems involved in calcium balance and their roles.  Describe the function and regulation of parathyroid hormone.  Describe the biosynthesis of Vitamin D and its role in calcium metabolism.  Discuss features of calcium imbalance syndromes.Parathyroid Gland PhysiologyAnatomy of the Parathyroid  On average, there are 4 glands behind the thyroid, each about the size of a grain.  Comprised of brown/fatty vascularized, encapsulated tissue. Average 4 glands behind thyroid, each about size of grain; brown/fatty vascularized tissue, encapsulated    Key Cells in the Parathyroid:  An oncocyte is an epithelial cell characterized by an excessive amount of mitochondria, resulting in an abundant acidophilic, granular cytoplasm.          Chief Cells → sense Ca2+ and produce PTH.      Oxyphil (oncocytic) Cells → large, eosinophilic (pink), granular cytoplasm; lower activity (but more mitochondria).        Structurally arranged into solid nests of cells separated by fibrous/fatty tissue.Electrolytes and Hormones1. Calcium  Functions: signal transduction, membrane potential, muscle contraction, co-factor; tightly regulated by PTH receptors (GPCR)    Distribution: 99% in skeleton, 0.5% protein bound, 0.5% ionic; intake/loss about 1 g/day; low intracelluarly, high extracellularly.   Ionic calcium is active; it’s inactive when bound to proteins.2. Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)  PTH: can be secreted in larger or smaller proteins, but only amino acid 1-34 of the polypeptide are active (clinically used as recombinant PTH → Teriparatide).  These’s active study on how the C-terminus fragments play a role in specificity and efficacy.  The PTHR receptor is promiscuous; it shares binding with the PTHrP growth factor (PTH related protein).          In cancers, with upregulation of PTHrP, you can develop something called a humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, which we’ll see later.        PTH levels change rapidly to keep Ca2+ levels in a narrow range → so both calcium (and activated Vitamin D3), are tightly regulated.  Effects of PTH           ↑ bone turnover (via ↑ osteoclast activity).      ↑ renal Ca re-absorption (at the DCT) → Ca ↑.      ↑ renal PO4 secretion (at the DCT) → PO4 ↓.                  PTH has opposing effects on serum Ca and PO4.                    ↑ 1α-hydroxylase activity, also in the kidney (↑ calcitriol). Increases gut Ca absorption.                  Recall that Vitamin D is first hydroxylated in the liver (25-hydroxylation), and is again hydroxylated in the kidney (1-hydroxylation).          The end product is calcitriol = activated Vitamin D3, which can bind to receptors in the gut and increase Ca2+ absorption.          Note → there are no PTH receptors in the gut, only Vitamin D3 receptors, so gut absoprtion is an indirect effect.                      So in summary, PTH directly increases Ca2+ absorption from bones, indirectly increases absorption from the gut, and directly reduces losses from the kidney.3. Vitamin D  Steroid hormone (cholesterol based).  Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) can either be absorbed from:          Diet → direct consumption.      Skin → D3 precursors in our skin are converted to cholecalciferol via sunlight (UV).        Ideally, dietary Vitamin D isn’t necessary, but in places without as much sun (like Canada), it may be necessary.  Cholecelciferol is converted to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (aka. calcifediol) by 25-hydroxylase (in the liver).  25-hydroxycholecaliferol is converted to 1-25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcifitriol, C3) by 1α-hydroxylase (in the kidney).          Recall that 1α-hydroxylase is what was upregulated by PTH.        Vitamin D3 increases GI tract Ca2+/PO4 absorption, and bone resorption and mineralization as well.  Calcium Metabolism      Cholecaciferol = Vitamin D3 is absorbed from diet or the skin (with UV light).    It’s converted to calcifediol = 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in the liver.    This is then converted to calcitriol = 1-25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the kidney.  Hyperparathyroidism  Symptoms: Recall the phrase ‘abdominal groans, mental moans, breaking bones, kidney stones’.  1° Hyperparathyroidism          Almost always caused by benign adenomas of the parathyroid.      The next most common cause is idiopathic hyperplasia.      Results in hypercalcemia since the PTH increases absorption.      Can result in stones, and bone pathologies like osteopenia (precursor to osetoporosis).        2° Hyperparathyroidism          Almost always caused by kidney pathology (chronic kidney disease, renal failure).      Can also be due to problems with Vitamin D (resistance or deficiency).      Here, problems with absorbing Vitamin D, or fully activating it (in the kidney), results in less available calcitriol, reducing gut calcium absorption. Hence, in this case, we have an absence of hypercalcemia.      As a result of reduced Ca2+ absorption, the parathyroid tries to increase PTH to compensate, leading to hyperparathroidism.      Since PTH can still directly resorb bone, you still end up with bone pathologies, such as Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica.        Primary vs Secondary Hyperparathyroidism                             Primary        Secondary                            Common Cause        Parathyroid adenoma        Kidney pathology                    Pathophysiology        Hyperactive Parathyroid Tissue        Low activated Vitamin D3                    Distinguishing Feature        Hypercalemia        NO Hypercalemia                  Both will result in bone resorption and potential complications.  Hypoparathyroidism  True hypoparathyroidism is almost always iatrogenic          Often seen post-thyroidectomy, since the parathyroid glands are hard to dissociate from the thyroid tissue.      Can occasionally be due to an autoimmune cause.      Can rarely be due to congenital agenesis (DiGeorge syndrome).        Symptoms of associated Hypocalcemia:          Impaired memory, personality changes.      Numbness (particularly oral).      Carpopedal spasm (violent muscle spasm).      More severely, convulsions and tetanus.      Other Disorders in Calcium Regulation  As we’ve seen above hyper- or hypo-calcemia isn’t necessarily synonymous with hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism.  There are a number of other causes of hyper- or hypo-calcemia, some of which are listed below:Both Jansen’s Metaphyseal Chondroplasia and Blomstrand’s Chondrodysplasia are extremely rare. To date, there are only 20 known cases of JMC in the world.  Mutations in the PTH Receptor          Activating Mutation → Jansen’s Metaphyseal Chondroplasia, results in dwarfism, presumably due to constant resorption of bone.      Inactivating Mutation → Blomstrand’s Chondrodysplasia, results in advanced bone maturation, diffuse ossification, and early death.        Remember      Jansen’s Metaphyseal Chondroplasia is caused by an activating mutation in the PTH receptor.    Blomstrand’s Chondrodysplasia is caused by an inactivating mutation in the PTH receptor.    Ca2+ sensing receptor mutations           Mutations that impair the body’s ability to sense calcium will make the body think that there’s less calcium than there really is.      Hence, the calcium-PTH curve shifts to the right, and we have hypercalcemia.      This results in a disease called familial hypocaliuric hypercalcemia (FHH).        Humoral Hypercalemia of Malignancy (HHM)          Pseudohyperparathyroidism due to a carcinoma that produces the cross-reactive PTHrP, which can bind the PTH receptor and induce hypercalcemia.      Often seen with prostate cancers.        Vitamin D Toxicity          Too much activated Vitamin D → too much calcium resorption → hypercalcemia.        Sarcoidosis          Granulomas activate Vitamin D.        Milk-alkali (Burnett’s) Syndrome          Name derived from patients who would take lots of milk and antacids (alkaline) to control their dyspepsia.      Results in hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis.      Parathyroid Gland PathologyEmbryology  3rd branchial pouch:          Inferior parathyroids and thymus, and actually descend below the ones that arise from the 4th branchial pouch!      This is a piece of trivia that’s always asked on the wards, so it’s useful to remember.      Aberrant migration more common.        4th branchial pouch:          Superior parathyroids and ultimobranchial body.      More constant in position.        Parathyroid glands can end up in all sorts of crazy places, which can make it difficult to identify and preserve them during surgery.Microscopy  Encapsulated and well vascularized.  All endocrine organs are well vascularized, to have a medium through which they can secrete hormone.  2 main cell types:          Chief Cells → the ‘building block’ of the parathyroid tissue, actively secreting parathyroid hormone.      Oncocytic/Oxyphil Cells → non-functional, senescent cells, and stuffed with mitochondria.      Parathyroid Adenoma  Single enlarged gland, with compensatory atrophy of the other glands.  Benign, F:M = 4:1, usually single gland.  Pathology: clonal proliferation of chief cells, encapsulated, displace normal tissue   Treatment: surgery (excise another ‘normal’ gland as well to verify that the adenoma is atypical).Parathyroid Carcinoma  Extremely rare.  Epidemiology: uncommon, older individuals, severe hypercalcemia, larger, infiltrative (neck dissection harder).  Pathology: nests of malignant cells separated by fibrous bands; lymphovascular invasion   Treatment: surgery en bloc resection including ipsilateral thyroid, 50% cure, recurrences often seen within 3 years.Primary Parathyroid Hyperplasia  Idiopathic cause.  Second most common cause of hyperparathyroidism, after a benign adenoma.  Most of them are sporadic (80%).  Some are familial (20%), and associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN1, MEN2A).Pharmacology of Calcium Metabolism  The normal serum concentration of calcium is 2.25-2.55 mM.          You need to know this!        Ca2+ concentrations are tightly regulated by 3 factors, two of which are clinically important:          Parathyroid Hormone      Vitamin D → not really a vitamin; it’s a hormone.      Calcitonin → recall that this is clinically unimportant, and is produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid.        PTH directly affects kidney and bone resorption of calcium, and indirectly affects gut absorption via activated Vitamin D.  Remember      The normal serum concentration of calcium is 2.25-2.55 mM.  Vitamin D  Some different types of Vitamin D include:          Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) → what’s absorbed from diet or metabolized with UV exposure. With insufficient sun exposure or dietary vitamin D, you can become deficient. The extreme form is rickets.      Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) → derived from plant metabolism of ergosterol. Slightly different, but same biological effects, without the need for UV exposure. Less potent. This is the form added to milk and bread.      25-(OH)D3 (calcifediol) → the metabolite formed after 25-hydroxylation in the liver. Most potent metabolite for stimulating renal reabsorption of Ca2+ and PO4.      1,25-(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) → activated vitamin D3.       Dihydrotachysterol (DHT) → less potent, used in nephrology.        Vitamin D acts through the following mechanisms (much like PTH):          to facilitate Ca/PO4 absorption by the small intestine,      to interact with PTH to enhance Ca/PO4 mobilization from bone, and      to decrease Ca/PO4 excretion by the kidney.        Any of the above types of Vitamin D can be used therapeutically.  The 4 major uses of Vitamin D are: 	1. Treatment of hypoparathyroidism.          Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Increases gut absorption of Calcium.      Prophylaxis and cure of nutritional rickets.      Treatment of metabolic rickets and osteomalacia.        Calcitriol tends to be used when a rapid onset it needed.  D2, D3 and calcifediol are used more generally for vitamin D supplementation.  Vitamin D toxicity is extremely dangerous with patients on Digoxin:          Recall that digoxin inhibits the Na+/K+ pump in cardiomyocytes.      Without the Na+/K+ pump, sodium accumulates in the cell, and as a response, the cell uses a Na+/Ca++ pump, which causes an accumulation of intracellular calcium. This increases contractility.      With even more plasma calcium, this effect can be dangerously exaggerated.      Other Drugs Affecting Calcium Metabolism  Treatments for Osteoporosis                    Inhibitors of Resorption        Stimulators of Bone Formation                            Bisphosphonates        Sodium fluoride                    Vitamin D (&amp; Ca2+)        PTH (teriparatide)                    Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)        Strontium ranelate                    Selective Estrogen Receptor Modifiers (SERMs)                             RANK-L Inhibitors                       Bisphosphonates          Incorporates into bone. Inhibits osteoclasts to prevent calcium loss from bone.      ___dronate drugs → alendronate, risedronate, pamidronate, etc.      Uses: Osteoporosis, Paget’s Disease. Pamidronate is used more with hypercalcemia. Zolendronate (newer bisphosphonate) is used for malignancy and osteolytic bone lesions.      Adverse effects: headache, rash, abdominal discomfort, MSK/bone pain, diarrhea, loss of taste, gastric irritation, osteonecrosis of jaw (very rare).        Hormone Replacement Therapy          Used less often now for osteoporosis since the rise of bisphosphonates, and recent clinical trials.        Selective estrogen receptor modifier (SERM)          Raloxifene → mediates factors produced by osteoblasts.        RANK-L Inhibitors          Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand.      Denosumab (Prolia) → inhibits osteoclast action.        Recombinant PTH          Teriparatide (Forteo). Expensive ($$$).        Calcimimetic Drugs          Cinacalcet (Sensipar) → allosteric activator of Ca sensing receptor on parathyroid chief cells, increasing calcium sensitivity, leading to decreased PTH secretion at the same calcium concentration.        More           Thiazide diuretics reduce Ca excretion.      Loop diuretics increase Ca excretion.      Glucocorticoids increase bone resorption.      Fluoride stimulates bone growth, but only in quantities far above what’s available in our water supply. In excess it can lead to flurosis.

A Framework for Thyroid Disorders  For a review of material from last year, see The Thyroid.How do Patients Present?  You have symptoms:          Related to Structure.      Related to Function.        Many patients actually present incidentally, because they’re picked up on imaging for something completely different (eg. due to a carotid ultrasound, or a head CT).Assessing Function  Thyroid function can be assessed with:          Serum TSH → look at pituitary stimulation.      Serum Free T3/ Free T4 (FT3/FT4) → free thyroid hormone is measured so the effects of binding proteins are ignored.        With Thyrotoxicosis (~Hyperthyroid), you have less TSH because the pituitary doesn’t stimulate the thyroid since it’s already active, and the free T3/T4 are elevated.  With a Primary Hypothyroid problem, you have more TSH (the pituitary gland tries to stimulate the thyroid), and the free T3/T4 fall.  The TSH is the most sensitive test of thyroid function.          It can detect subclinical hyperthyroidism/hypothyroidism, where the TSH has fallen/risen respectively, but the FT3/FT4 hasn’t changed yet.        Finally, there are central causes of hypo/hyperthroidism:          Here, the TSH doesn’t change, or changes in the wrong direction, in response to T3/T4 levels.        For a better conceptual grasp of how TSH and FT3/FT4 can be used to differentiate thyroid problems, see below:   Summary Diagrams  Hyperthyroidism  Note that we’ll be dealing specifically with thyrotoxicosis, which is different from hyperthyroidism:          Hyperthryoidism → an overactive thyroid gland.      Thyrotoxicosis → high blood levels of thyroid hormone.        Practically, this means that you can thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism (eg. with ingestion of external hormone).Characteristics of Thyrotoxicosis  Symptoms:          Heat intolerance, Increased sweating.      Tremor, Palpitations, Hyperactivity, Insomnia.      Emotional lability/Anxiety.      Weight loss despite increased appetite.      Increased GI motility/Hyperdefecation.        Signs:          Tremor.      Soft, warm, skin.      Increased heart rate.      Increased cardiac output.        If the thyrotoxicosis is secondary to Graves’ Disease, then you’ll have some associated eye symptoms:          Stare → decreased blink.      Lid retraction → the eyelid will be retracted, so you can see the top of the sclera.      Lid lag → the iris and pupil will move faster than the eyelid      Proptosis → eyes actually pushed forward.      Periorbital edema.      Diplopia → double vision, here often with an upward gaze.      Visual loss → emergency, requires urgent optho referral.        Those that proptosis and exopthalmos are both used to describe protrustion of the eyes.  Exophthalmos also describes forward protrusion of the globe. Several authors use the terms differently, which is confusing:          Proptosis and exophthalmos are often used interchangeably.      Exophthalmos is sometimes used to refer to severe (over 18 mm) proptosis.      Exophthalmos is sometimes also used to refer to endocrine-related proptosis.      An Approach to Thyrotoxicosis  Thyrotoxicosis is a high level of thyroid hormone in the blood.  This can have many causes:          Increased Thyroid Hormone Synthesis → Hyperthyroidism.      Increased Release of Thyroid Hormone → Tissue damage to the Thyroid.      Exogeneous Thyroid Hormone → Ingestion of external factors.        With respect to Increased thyroid hormone synthesis, there are many causes, but it’s best to focus on the most common ones:          Immune Mediated (Antibody) Stimulation of the TSH Receptor.                  Grave’s Disease is the most common example.                    Autonomous Thyroid Tissue → a growth.                  Toxic Multinodular Goitre → multiple nodules.          Toxic Adenoma → one nodule.                    Graves’ Disease  This is the archetypical cause of increased thyroid hormone synthesis.  Pathophysiology          Autoimmune: stimulation of TSH receptor by antibody (thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin).      Constitutive stimulation results in hyperplasia and hypertrophy.      Eye complications are due to increased volume of the retro-orbital connective tissues and extraocular muscles.                  This is caused by the induction of thyroblasts to produce mucoid like material. These then mature into fat cells (depending on what genes they turn on).          This results in inflammation, edema, + glycosamines + glycans, resulting in exophthalmos.                      Most common cause of hyperthyroidism.          Women &gt; Men.      30-50 yrs &gt; Young/old.      Systemic, ocular and skin manifestations.      Diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland.        Histology:          Top → Graves’ disease.                  Hyperplastic follicle cells form small, simple, papillary projections into lumen          Prominent ‘scalloping’ of the colloid.                    Bottom → normal thyroid.                  Evenly spaced follicle cells form oval/round follicles.                      Diagnosis:          History and physical exam.                  P/E can help confirm Graves’ Disease with bulging of the eyes.          But if you don’t see it, you can still have Graves’, because most patients with Graves’ won’t present with orbitopathies.                    TSH, free T4 and T3.                  The best test to order initially is the TSH.          If it’s normal, then you really need to have a high pre-test probability to continue investigations.                    TBII (ie. TSH-Receptor antibodies) → Thyrotropin Binding Inhibitory Immunoglobulins.                  Typically not used, because the TSH, FT3/FT4, and Hx and P/E are usually sufficient to make the diagnosis.          TBII measurement is useful in pregnancy as Radioactive Iodine Uptake and Scan is contraindicated because it will damage the fetal thyroid and can result in congenital hypothyroidism.          So TBII’s is used to diagnose Graves’ Disease in the pregnant.          This is important because the TSH-receptor antibodies can target the fetal thyroid and cause fetal hyperthyroidism.                    Radioactive Iodine Uptake → should have diffuse uptake vs. localized uptake (which would be seen with a toxic multinodular goitre or a toxic adenoma).                  We saw this last year in the Thyroid lecture.                      Treatment          Drugs → ie. Methimazole, Propylthiouracil.                  Methimazole is first line, except for the first trimester of pregnancy, in which case Propylthiouracil is used.          Both have a small risk of agranulocytosis; Propylthiouracil has an additional risk of causing a fulminant hepatitis.          More common in Europe &amp; Japan.                    Radioactive Iodine Therapy                  Often results in permanent hypothyroidism (although, as was mentioned last lecture, this may be done intentionally, to avoid having to re-treat for hyperthyroidism).          Contraindicated in pregnancy.          Can often exacerbate Graves’ opthalmopathy (especially in smokers).          Most commonly used in Canada and the USA.                    Surgical Thyroidectomy                  Permanent hypothyroidism.          Surgical risks include hypoparathyroidism (the parathyroid glands are small and difficult to dissect), and laryngeal nerve injury.          More common in Europe.                      Diagnostic Features for increased Hormone Synthesis    Treatment of Graves’ Disease  Thyroiditis  This is the archetypical cause of increased thyroid hormone release.  Thyroiditis → inflammation resulting in damage to the thyroid gland.          Most commonly because of a viral infection.      Patients will often have had a previous infection.        When you perform a radioactive iodine uptake scan in a patient with thyroiditis, you’ll see something like what’s on the right.  You’ll see very poor localization, suggesting poor uptake due to thyroid damage.  Types of Thyroiditis:          Viral/Post-viral → also sometimes called de Quervain’s, or ‘painful’ thyroiditis.      Autoimmune → also sometimes called ‘painless’, ‘silent’.                  Can get a transient autoimmune hyperthyroidism with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, due to release of thyroid hormone from destroyed thyroid tissue.          This is referred to as Hashitoxicosis.                    Drug Induced.      Radiation Induced.      Traumatic → eg. a craptastically vigorous thyroid exam.        Management of Thyroiditis:          Nothing that you can really do except wait for the thyroid to recover and to ensure that your diagnosis is correct.      Treat their symptoms → beta-blockers to lower their heart rate, etc.      Monitor for resolution, and for hypothyroidism. After the thyroid tissue has been destroyed, and the released thyroid hormone is gone, the patient is at risk for hypothyroidism.      HypothyroidismCharacteristics of Hypothyroidism  Symptoms:          Cold intolerance.      Weight gain despite decreased appetite.      Fatigue, slow mentation, apathy, constipation.      Shortness of breath.        Signs:          Cool, pale skin.      Decreased heart rate.      Diastolic Hypertension/narrow pulse pressure.                  Most people expect patients with hypothyroidism to have hypotension, but you actually have diastolic hypertension.          The idea here is that the heart pumps less strongly, hence the narrow pulse pressure. To compensate for this, the diastolic blood pressure rises to maintain the mean arterial pressure, resulting in diastolic hypertension.                    Decreased cardiac output.      Slow relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes.                  The actual reflex will be fast, but the relaxation will be slowed.                    An Approach to Hypothyroidism  Differential Diagnosis:          Autoimmune Destruction is the most common cause.                  Of these, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis is the most common disease.                    Drugs → lithium, amiodarine.      Removal of the Thyroid Gland → surgery, radioactive iodine.      Decreased Central Stimulation → trauma, surgery, tumour, infiltrative diseases.        It’s easy to differentiate between a primary cause and a central cause of hypothyroidism.          If it’s a primary cause, the TSH should be high, to try and stimulate the thyroid.      If it’s a central cause, the TSH will be low or inappropriately normal, relative to the levels of FT3/FT4.      Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis  Also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.  Like Graves’ disease, it’s also a disease that’s mediated by auto-antibodies.          Unlike with Graves’, where you have Ab binding to the TSH receptor, with Hashimoto’s you have antibodies against the thyroid tissue itself.        This results in antibody-mediated destruction of the thyroid tissue.  Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.  As with most auto-immune diseases, it presents most often in women in their early/mid adulthood.  Unlike Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis doesn’t have any extra-thyroidal manifestations.  There are short term and long term consequences of the thyroid damage:          Short term → enlarged, nodular, rubbery gland.      Long term → lymphoid aggregates, Hurthle cells, fibrosis, shrinkage.        Hurthle cells are characterized as enlarged epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm as a result of altered mitochondria.  Graves’ Disease vs. Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis                             Grave’s Disease        Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis                            Antibody Target        TSH Receptor        Thyroid Tissue                    Results in        Hyperthyroidism        Hypothyroidism (may have transient hyperthyroidism)                    Seen typically in        Middle aged women        Middle aged women                    Treatment        (1) Thyroidectomy(2) Radioactive Iodine(3) Medication (Methimazole, Propylthiouracil)        Levothyroxine              Diagnosis:          History → other autoimmune diseases, hypothyroid symptoms.      P/E → rubbery goitre.      TSH, followed by FT4 if TSH is high.      There are anti-TPO and/or anti-thyroglobulin Abs, which are pathognomonic, but usually not necessary to make a diagnosis.        Treatment:          Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine.      Titrate to normal TSH.      Disorders of Thyroid Structure  When you have a problem with thyroid structure, it can either be diffuse or focal:          Diffuse Enlargement → goitre.      Focal Enlargement → nodule.        Possible structural symptoms include:          Hoarseness → close proximity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.      Stridor → compression of the trachea.      Dysphagia → compression of the esophagus.      Swelling of the neck.        Goitre → enlargement of the thyroid gland.          Sometimes described as ‘multinodular’.      Can by associated with disturbances of thyroid function (hypo- or hyper-).      For instance, toxic multinodular goitre is a goitre with increased thyroid function.      Simple/Multinodular Sporadic Goiter  Most common thyroid disease in North America.  Idiopathic, most commonly seen in young women.  Typically see asymmetric enlargement of the gland.  Pathological Changes:          Early → hyperplastic, active thyroid tissue.      Late → less active, hemorrhage, cysts, calcification, fibrosis.        Diagnosis:          Hx and P/E (feel the thyroid).      Ultrasound (recall the criteria we saw last year in our Thyroid lecture.).      RAI uptake and scan to differentiate a hot nodule from a cold nodule (cold nodules are more likely to be malignant).        Treatment:          No intervention/monitoring if minor.      RAI ablation if it’s hyperfunctioning.      Surgery if compressive symptoms.      Investigating Thyroid Nodules  This is exactly the same as what we saw last year; in fact, it was probably better explained back then.  Please read the Thyroid lecture.  The thresholds for FNAB are somewhat different in this lecture:          &gt; 2 cm almost always biopsy, unless it’s a simple cyst.      &lt; 1 cm almost never biopsy      1-2 cm depends:                  Clinical → Growth, family history, radiation, hard, LNs.          Ultrasound → Solid, hypoechoic, calcifications, irregular, LNs.                      The treatment depends on the result of the FNAB, and is exactly the same as what we saw last year:Thyroid CancersParafollicular cells are also called C-cells, presumably since they secrete calcitonin.  Recall that we have follicular cells, which secrete thyroid hormone and parafollicular cells, which secrete calcitonin.  We can have cancers derived from either of these.  Follicular Cell Derived:          Papillary (Most common).      Follicular      Anaplastic        Parafollicular Cell Derived:          Medullary.-There are also follicular adenomas, which are the only benign thyroid neoplasm.      Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma  The majority of all thyroid cancers.  Most are indolent, and are seen in women.  Nuclear features are diagnostic:          These include enlargement, irrecular and notched nuclear membranes, grooves, inclusions, and clear nuclei.        Calcifications are characteristic, but not pathognomonic.          Concentric calcifications are known as Psammoma bodies.        Treatment:          Total thyroidectomy + thyroid hormone replacement.      Post op radioactive iodine and TSH suppression to ‘finish off’ the tumour.      Excellent prognosis.      Follicular Adenoma  Only benign thyroid neoplasm.  Encapsulated, with no lympovascular invasion.  Lack the nuclear features of PTC.Follicular Carcinoma  Older women.  Usually at least partially encapsulated.  Will have invasion of the capsule and vessels.  Will often have metastasis to distant sites, particularly the bones and the lungs.Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma  Thought to represent progression of a PTC or a FC into a more malignant phenotype.  Uniformly lethal, extremely aggressive.  Histologically unidentifiable → poorly differentiated, complete loss of architecture.Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma  Tumors of parafollicular “C” cells responsible for Calcitonin production.  Can be sporadic, or familial.          Sporadic → 80%, presents as a mass, middle age.      Familial → 20%, presents bilaterally, younger age, associated with MEN (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia).        Aggressive → 40% 10 yr survival.  Lab diagnosis → Calcitonin levels.          Recall that calcitonin doesn’t seem to be too critical in humans, except that it can be used as a marker for medullary carcinomas.        Histological Features:          Tumour cells form sheets and nests and have uniform nuclei with a stippled (salt and pepper) chromatin pattern typical of neuroendocrine tumours.      A very helpful feature is the presence of abundant extracellular homogeneous pink material which, like amyloid, is red with Congo Red staining.      Immunohistochemical examination using antibodies against calcitonin shows that these tumours contain calcitonin in contrast to other thyroid tumours which contain thyroglobulin.

	{"title": "Thyroid Pharmacology", "text": "Lecture Objectives  List the drugs used in treating hyperthyroid conditions.  Describe the pharmacology, kinetics and mechanism of action of the thioamides and anionic inhibitors.  Describe the adverse effects associated with use of the drugs used in treating hyperthyroidism.  Describe the therapeutic uses of iodide and iodinated contrast media.  Describe the therapeutic and diagnostic uses of radioactive iodine.  Describe the adverse effects associated with the use of iodine and iodinated compounds.Thyroid PharmacologyYou don’t need to know this stereochemistry for the final, but it’s still pretty neat!  Recall that there are 2 forms of T3 → T3, and rT3 (reverse T3).  One is highly active, and the other is inactive. Why is there a difference?          You can have 2 different binding arrangements of 3 iodines on the aromatic rings.                  3,5,3’-tri-iodothyronine (T3) is a highly active thyroid hormone.          3,3’,5’-tri-iodothyronine (rT3) is inactive.                    The ether group between the two aromatic rings has a bent shape, meaning that the 2 rings in the thyroid hormone aren’t coplanar; they’re bent.      Iodine is a big atom, so when the iodine groups are attached proximally to the ether group, they’re so big that they cause the bond to twist.      This changes the shape of the rT3 hormone so it doesn’t fit the receptor, making it inactive.        The asterisk marks a location where there can be enantiomerism.           So there can be L-thyroxine, and D-thyroxine.      All active thyroid hormones are in a L-configuration.      L-thyroxine = levothyroxine, which is what’s given to patients with hypothyroidism.      There is also a D-configuration thyroxine, which is comparatively unimportant (it has lipid lowering properties).      Conversion of T4 to T3  Recall that most T3 is produced in peripheral tissue, converted from T4.  Conversion (activation) occurs by removing the 5’ iodine of the outer ring of T4.  Although T4 still has a biological effect, it’s so much weaker than that of T3 that it can be considered a prohormone for T3.  The deiodinases that convert T4 → T3 are stereoselective, and require a selenium prosthetic group.          In extremely rare instances of selenium deficiency, we can have impaired conversion of T4 → T3.        The two deiodinases we saw in the last lecture were D2 and D3.  Recall that D3 not only converts T4 to rT3 (inactive), but also T3 to T2.  In other words, D3 is an inactivator of thyroid hormone.  Remember      D2 is a thyroid hormone activator (it converts T4 → T3).    D3 is a thyroid hormone inactivator (it converts T4 → rT3, and T3 → T2).  Treatment of Hypothyroidism  Causes of Hypothyroidism:          Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis → most common cause, especially in women. Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.      Impaired hormone synthesis.      Destruction of thyroid tissue (eg. irradiation, surgery).      Secondary to pituitary/hypothalmic problems (eg. TSH deficit).      Congenital (cretinism).      Pharmacological (eg. following consumption of antithyroid drugs/foods).        Pharmacological treatment of hypothyroidism is by replacement therapy.          Replacement therapy is so effective that we actually use it to treat hyperthyroidism now, by removing the thyroid gland, and then using replacement hormone.        Hormone preparations are either animal source extracts or synthetic hormone.          The latter is by far a better choice, because animal extracts are less pure, and may have antigens that trigger an immune reaction.      Synthetic T4 is available as levothyroxine, aka. Synthroid©.      Synthetic T3 is available as liothyronine, aka. Cytomel©.        An example of an animal source extract is thyroid dessicated USP.          USP = United States Pharmacopeia. A pharmacopeia is a drug listing, which includes standards and records of old drugs      There’s a site online called ‘Stop the Thyroid Madness’ that is full of (wrong) material about how synthetic hormone causes horrible side effects.      They advocate the use of animal extract, which ironically is even more likely to have material in it that will lead to an allergic response.        Synthetic T4 is the hormone of choice because T4 has a more consistent potency, and a longer duration of action.  T3 is used only occassionally, when a faster onset of action is required (eg. with a myxedema coma):          Myxedema coma → a loss of brain function as a result of severe, longstanding hypothyroidism.        Synthetic hormones have few side effects, aside from those that are a consequence of their biological function (eg. increased heart rate, increased metabolism, tremors, etc). These are known as extension effects.          These symptoms may often mimic sympathetic hyperactivity.        The usual tablet dosage in an adult is 100 µg/D (in kids, it’s 100 µg/m2/d, so it’s corrected by body area).          When starting hormone replacement therapy, it’s best to slowly ramp up the dosage to a therapeutic level, to let the patient’s body acclimatize.       Treatment of Hyperthyroidism  There are 3 possible treatment routes for hyperthyroidism:          Medication → drugs which diminish the synthesis and/or release of active thyroid hormone.      Radioactive Iodine Ablation → ablation of hyperactive thyroid cells using radioactive iodine.      Surgery → removal of the thyroid gland and thyroid hormone replacement.      Medication  Medications for hyperthyroidism aim to reduce synthesis or reduce release of thyroid hormone.  These include:          Thioamides → Methimazole, and Propylthiouracil.      Iodine → ironically, excess iodine anion can actually diminish thyroid function.                  This is known as the Wolff–Chaikoff effect → a reduction in thyroid hormone levels caused by ingestion of a large amount of iodine.                    Objectives: (1) List the drugs used in treating hyperthyroid conditions. (2) Describe the pharmacology, kinetics and mechanism of action of the thioamides and anionic inhibitors.Thioamides  Thioamides are used in several hyperthyroid conditions, including Graves’ disease, thyrotoxicosis, and toxic nodular goitres.  Examples include methimazole and propylthiouracil.  Mechanism of action:          Inhibits the incorporation of iodine into the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin.      Inhibits the coupling of MIT and DIT, which is needed to cleave T3/T4 from thyroglobulin.        Remember      Thioamides have 2 mechanisms of action:              They inhibit the incorporation of iodine onto thyroglobulin.        They inhibit the coupling of MIT and DIT, which is needed to cleave T3/T4 from thyroglobulin.              As a result, there is reduced hormone synthesis.  Treatment takes a while, because pre-existing stores of thyroid hormone must be depleted.  Thioamides used in Canada include:          Methimazole (MMI)                  Is much stronger than propylthiouracil.                    Propylthiouracil (PTU)                  Less potent, however it does have a diminished ability to cross the placenta versus MMI.          As a result, propylthiouracil is used during the first trimester of pregnancy, because of fears of potential teratogenic effects.                          PTU has a small risk of fulminant hepatitis, so this is basically the only time when it’s used.                                Additionally, PTU has a faster onset of action.                          This is because PTU has another function: it inhibits the D2 deiodinase which converts T4 to T3.              So it has a second effect of inhibiting T4 → T3 conversion.                                            Minor side-effects of thioamides include fever, and rashes. Rarer problems include cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, and arthralgia.  All thioamides carry the small risk of causing agranulocytosis (0.3-0.6% of patients).Objective: Describe the adverse effects associated with use of the drugs used in treating hyperthyroidism.  Comparison of Thioamides                             Methimazole        Propylthiouracil                            Strength        Strong        Weak (~10x less effective than MMI)                    Used in        First-line        Only in 1st trimester of pregnancy                    Onset of Action        Slower        Faster                    Serious (rare) Adverse Effects        Agranulocytosis        Agranulocytosis and Fulminant hepatitis            Objective: Describe the therapeutic uses of iodide and iodinated contrast media.Iodide  Counterintuitively, iodide (I-) itself has an antithyroid activity.  At pharmacological doses (ie. high doses), iodide inhibits organification reactions, and the release of hormones from the thyroid.          Organification = attaching elemental iodide to an organic moiety (eg. thyroglobulin).        In other words, if you have too much iodide, it can depress thyroid function.  Hence, the response to iodide can be variable → either hypo- or hyper-thyroidism can result.  iodide is often given as an adjunct to thioamides:          In this case, the thioamide must be given first. If you give the iodide first, it may result in an initial increase in thyroid hormone formation, which would exacerbate hyperthyroidism.      If iodide is used in treatment, you cannot use radioactive iodide therapy for several weeks. This is because it won’t be taken up by the thyroid with such a high pre-existing supply.        Prolonged iodide use is not suggested:          Using iodide for greater than 6-8 weeks introduces the risk of the thyroid ‘escaping’ from its inhibitory effects.      This can lead to severe thyrotoxicosis (the thyroid is now producing as much thyroid hormone as it wants), which can be life threatening.        Adverse Effects:          Collectively known as “iodism”, and may include fever, rash, mucous membrane ulcers, and, rarely, anaphylactoid reactions. Toxicity is uncommon.        Iodide in Medications:          Some medications have substantial iodide content.      Antiseptics often contain iodide.      Amiodarone (which we saw in the Antiarrythmics lecture in Cardiology) has a huge amount of iodide (75 mg/tablet)!      Radio-contrast media also has a high iodide content.                  In fact, sometimes, contrast is used as an ‘unlabeled’ treatment for patients in a thyroid storm, since it’s a readily accessible source of iodide.                      We mentioned that the response to iodine can be both hypo- or hyper-thyroidism. This is characterized by the Wolff-Chaikoff Effect or the Jod-Basedow Phenomenon.  What is the “Wolff‐Chaikoff Effect”?          A physiological response where you decrease thyroid hormone production in the presence of an iodine load.      Normal people ‘escape’ the W‐C effect and then achieve a new steady state of Euthyroidism.      Those with underlying, subclinical Hashimoto’s may not escape, but will instead become hypothyroid.        What is the “Jod‐Basedow phenomenon”?          (Jod = Iodine, Basedow = German physician who described autoimmune hyperthyroidism ~ the same time as Graves did)      This is seen in patients with underlying autonomous thyroid tissue (toxic nodules) or mild subclinical Graves’.      Here, they do not experience Wolff‐Chaikoff, but instead their thyroid uses an iodine load to make too much hormone, causing hyperthyroidism.        Wolff-Chaikoff Effect vs. Jod-Basedow Phenomenon      Wolff-Chaikoff Effect = Hypothyroidism following an iodine load.    Jod-Basedow Phenomenon = Hyperthyroidism following an iodine load. Seen in patients with toxic nodules or mild Graves’.  Radioactive IodineObjective: Describe the therapeutic and diagnostic uses of radioactive iodine.  There are 2 isotopes of radioactive iodine that are used medically:          131I → used pharmacologically to treat hyperthyroidism.                  Long half life → 8 days. This means that 99% is expended within 56 days.          Radiation consists of both γ-rays and β-particles.                    123I → used diagnostically for radioactive iodine scans.                  Short half life → only 13 hours. This gives you a brief exposure to radiation, which is better suited for a diagnostic test.          Radiation consists of γ-rays only. This avoids the carcinogenicity of β-particles.                      In other words, we use a more ‘powerful’ isotope for treating hyperthyroidism, and a ‘weaker’ isotope for diagnostics.          With 131I, the idea is that the radioactive iodine will be taken up into the thyroid much like normal iodine. There, the β-particle can destroy follicular cells, controlling the hyperthyroidism.      With 123I, we use the fact that iodine will localize to thyroid tissue, and we use a less cytotoxic isotope.        Comparison of 131I and 123I                             131I        123I                            Used for        Treating Hyperthyroidism        Radioactive Iodine Scans                    Emits        β-particles and γ-rays        γ-rays only                    Half life        Long (8 days)        Short (13 hours)            «span class=”sidenote”&gt;Describe the adverse effects associated with the use of iodine and iodinated compounds.&lt;/span&gt;  Side Effects of Radioactive Iodine:          The primary concern is the high incidence of delayed hypothyroidism.      In other words, we often overtreat the patient → instead of bringing them to a euthyroid condition, we veer too far.      Nowadays, some clinicians actually aim to overtreat → that is, they aim for hypothyroidism instead of a euthyroid condition.                  This is because it’s easier to treat hypothyroidism (with hormone replacement therapy), than it is to treat hyperthyroidism.          It’s better to overdo the treatment than to underdo it!                    Thyroiditis is also a concern.        Other ‘minor’ inconveniences include the fact that you have to avoid pregnant women, close contact, breast-feeding, and borders until your treatment is complete.Thyroid Toxicology  From this point on we will NOT be dealing with drugs currently used in treating hypo/hyperthyroidism.  We WILL be dealing with some relevant Toxicology, namely the antithyroidal effects of several ions.  Some ions are used in industrial processes and exposure of industrial workers may be a problem.Anions with Anti-thyroid Effects  Anions with anti-thyroid effects include:          Thiocyanate (SCN-)      Perchlorate (ClO4-)      Other anions (fluoroborate, fluorosulfonate, difluorophosphate, pertechnate, nitrate, and bromide).        These anions all have a similar hydrated radius to the iodine anion.          Hydrated radius = the radius of the anion when surrounded by water dipoles.        The idea here is that, since these anions have a similar shape to the iodine ion, they can compete with iodide for transport into the thyroid.          Perchlorate is about 10 times more active than thiocyanate, so it’s particularly important.        Why don’t they use these anions to treat hyperthyroidism?          Really bad side effects → perchlorate has been used, but it can cause fatal aplastic anemia with high doses.      It has been used to treat Graves’ disease and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in small doses though.        Lithium can decrease secretion of T4 and T3.          Unlike the anions described above, lithium inhibits export, not import.      Lithium is used in psychiatry.      Foods with Anti-thyroid Effects  Turnips and Cruciferous Plants (Cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts)          Due to the presence of a compound called goitrin, which resembles the thioamides (Methimazole, Propylthiouracil).      Goitrin is about as active as PTU in humans. In addition, humans that drink the milk from cattle that feed on kale will also end up with hypothyroidism, because the cows will concentrate the goitrin.      This isn’t really much of a problem in humans, since it’s difficult to ingest enough cabbage to induce hypothyroidism.      However, rabbits fed on cabbage leaves will develop goiters.        Cassava          A staple food in Africa, this plant contains compounds which can liberate cyanide and thiocyanate if not properly prepared.      We just saw that thiocyanate has an anti-thyroidal effect because it has a similar hydrated radius to that of iodide.      To resolve this, you have to pound the cassava before eating it → this breaks open cells, releasing enzymes that break down the thiocyanate.

Describe the actions of the active thyroid hormones and the consequences of hypo or hyper secretion.Functional Anatomy of the Thyroid  The largest endocrine organ.  Composed of follicular cells surrounding a thyroid follicle.          Envision this as a bunch of houses surrounding a common backyard.      Inside the thyroid follicle (the backyard), in the follicular lumen, is a substance called colloid.      Colloid → reservoir of materials for thyroid hormone production, particularly thyroglobulin (Tg).      Thyroglobulin is used to synthesize thyroid hormone.      Objective: Define the role of thyroglobulin in thyroid function  Thyroglobulin:          High molecular weight (660 KD).      Has a lot of tyrosine residues (~330) → these are important for producing T3 and T4, since T3 and T4 are tyrosine derivatives.      Production of Thyroid Hormone  HPT Axis = hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid.  Above is a parafollicular cell in the thyroid gland, which makes thyroid hormone.  One key ingredient for thyroid hormone is iodine.          However, iodine needs to get into the colloid, where thyroglobulin exists, to make T3 and T4.      How is this possible, with a low environmental availability of iodine?        We use something called the iodine trap:          NIS → a sodium (Na) iodine (I) symporter (S), which uses a Na+ gradient (generated actively) to transport I- into the thyroid cell.      Pendrin transports I- into lumen for oxidative coupling&lt;/i&gt; to thyroglobulin.        The Iodine Trap      Iodine is brought into the thyroid follicle via 2 steps:              To get in to the parafollicular cells, I- import is coupled with an Na+ gradient by NIS, a sodium iodine symporter.        To get out to the thyroid follicle, I- export is mediated by Pendrin.              Now that iodine has been moved from the basolateral side → parafollicular cell → colloid, it can be used to produce T3 and T4.          This is mediated by TPO → thyroid peroxidase.      TPO has 2 functions:                  It iodinates the tyrosine residues on Thyroglobulin.          It couples tyrosine residues, to create T3 and T4.                    Objective: Describe the molecular structure of the active thyroid hormones  Iodination:          The tyrosine residue can either be iodinated once to form monoiodotyrosine, or twice to form diiodotyrosine.        Coupling:          Monoiodotyrosine + diiodotyrosine = triiodotyrosine (T3).      Diiodotyrosine + diiodotyrosine = thyroxine (T4).        Remember      Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) is what iodinates Tg, and couples it to create T3 and T4.    T3 &amp; T4 are still attached to Thyroglobulin at this point, as modified tyrosine residues. They have to be chopped off to release the active hormones:          The Tg-T3/T4 complex is brought back into the cell by pinocytosis.      In the cell, iodinated Tg is proteolytically processed by MIT and DIT.      T3 and T4 can now freely exit the thyroid cell into the general circulation.      Objective: Describe the synthesis of active thyroid hormones in the thyroid gland.  Summary of Thyroid Hormone Production      Iodine is first brought into the thyroid cell on the basolateral side by NIS.    Iodine is then brought out of the thyroid cell on the apical side by Pendrin.    Now in the colloid, the I- can then be coupled to thyroglobulin to create a Tg-T3/T4 complex. This is mediated by TPO.    Tg-T3/T4 is then imported back into the thyroid cell via pinocytosis.    Tg-T3/T4 is then cleaved by proteases in the thyroid cell called MIT and DIT.    Free T3/T4 then exits the thyroid cell into the general circulation.    TSH can stimulate this process:          It increases NIS activity (import at the basolateral side).      It increases production of Tg in the colloid.      It increases TPO activity (iodination/coupling).      Thyroid Hormone TransportObjective: Describe the transport of thyroid hormones in the plasma.  Since the thyroid hormones are amino acid derivatives, they’re not water loving, and are lipid soluble (just like with steroid hormones).  Hence, to travel through the plasma, they need a carrier protein.  Thyroid Hormone carrier proteins:          Thyroxine Binding Globulin (TBG)                  The major carrier protein, high affinity.          Binds 75% of circulating T3 and T4.                    Transthyretin (TTR)                  Less affinity than TTG.          20% of circulating T4, 5% of circulating T3.                    Human Serum Albumin (HSA)                  Low affinity.          5% of circulating T4, 20% of circulating T3.                    Obejective: Discuss the factors regulating thyroid hormone levels (binding proteins, deiodinases, clearance, etc.)  These binding proteins regulate the bio-availability and half life of T3/T4.  Without them, thyroid hormones are rapidly cleared from circulation.Differentiating T3 and T4  What’s the difference between T3 and T4?          T3 is secreted less, is 10x more potent, and has a much shorter half life.      T4 is secreted more, is less potent, and has a much longer half life.      T3 functions as the active form of thyroid hormone, so it’s converted from T4 in destination tissues.        Conversion of T4→T3 is carried out by cell specific deiodinases (D1-D4).          The relative ratio of activity between these deiodinases will determine the strength of the signal at the end destination.      This conversion occurs in the target tissues of thyroid hormone.        T3 vs T4                             T3        T4                            % of hormone secreted        10%        90%                    % free in plasma        1%        0.1%                    Relative activity (potency)        10        1                    Half-life (days)        1        7            Thyroid Hormone ActionObjective: Discuss the factors regulating thyroid hormone levels (binding proteins, deiodinases, clearance, etc.)  Thyroid hormones can be modified at the destination tissue to increase or decrease signal strength:          If there’s not enough T3 in the end destination, T4 → T3.      If there’s too much active T3, then (1) T4 → rT3 or (2) T3 → T2.                  rT3 is reverse T3, which is an inactive form of T3.          By converting T4 to an inactive T3, we prevent an excessively strong downstream signal.          Similarly, T2 is also less active, so we accomplish the same thing.                    Note that D3 is involved in both the conversion of T4 → rT3 and T3 → T2.  Different deiodinases are involved in different conversions:          T4 is converted to T3 by D2.      T4 is converted to rT3 by D3.      T3 is converted to T2 by D3.      Objective: Explain the cellular mechanism of action of thyroid hormone.  Active T3 can pass through into the nucleus, where it can bind to TR (thyroid receptor), a nuclear receptor that functions like a transcription factor.  This results in the upregulation of genes that lead to the effects of thyroid hormone.Role of Thyroid HormonesObjective: Define the physiological role of thyroid hormones in development and the adult including the major effects on cellular metabolism  What do thyroid hormones do?  Early Growth &amp; Development:          Required for GH secretion and action.      Essential for early neural development (via induction of NGF → neural growth factor).      Hence, a maternal lack of T3/T4 results in growth retardation and cretinism.        In General:          Increases mitochondrial growth and activity:                  Therefore, it increases your basal metabolic activity.          Results in increased heat production, oxygen demand, HR, and SV.                    Stimulates Na+/K+ ATPase Activity:                  Specifically in the heart, increasing cardiac metabolic demand.                    Increases transcription of energy metabolism enzymes.                  Increased lipolysis (less fat), glycolysis (less glycogen), and gluconeogenesis (more glucose) results in more readily usable energy sources.                    Necessary for the induction of PRL (prolactin), GH (growth hormone), surfactant (in your lungs), and NGF (neural growth factor).                  So aberrant thyroid hormone levels impact growth, lung function, and the nervous system.                      Thyroid hormones acts on the order of hours, days, to weeks. They have long lasting effects.  Therefore, to treat thyroid disorders, it’ll take a long time.Thyroid DiseasesChronic Iodine Deficiency  There are endemic deficiencies of thyroid hormones (T3, T4) in different parts of the world, due to a dietary deficiency in iodine.          We also used to have that in Canada, but now, because we have fortified our salts with iodine, we no longer have an issue.      Objective: Illustrate the physiological basis of thyroid pathology  Chronic low iodine can result in an endemic goiter → enlargement of the thyroid gland.          This is because we don’t have the iodine necessary to make normal T3 and T4, so we have high levels of TSH, without any negative feedback.      Excessive TSH stimulation over time needs to hypertrophy of thryoid cells, resulting in a goiter.      Treated by reintroducing iodine, or IV T3/T4.      Objective: Describe the actions of the active thyroid hormones and the consequences of hypo or hyper secretionHypothyroidism  Symptoms include lack of energy, slow heart rate, muscle cramping, lack of concentration, poor memory, puffy eyelids, and feeling odd.Feeling odd.  Most common cause is Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis.Hashimoto’s Disease  Auto-immune disease which results in hypothyroidism.  Antibodies against TPO, thyroid peroxidase.          Recall that TPO was what iodinated thyroglobulin.        As a result, we have less T3/T4.Hyperthyroidism  Symptoms include feeling hot, increased sweating, a fast/strong/irregular heart-beat, nervousness, and trembling hands.  Most common cause is Graves’ Disease.Graves’ Disease  Auto-immune disease which results in hyperthyroidism.  Here, anti-TSH receptor antibodies bind to the receptor.  Binding of these antibodies to the TSH receptor leaves them ‘constitutively’ active, leading to unbounded T3/T4 production.Calcitonin  A third, less known, thyroid hormone.  Demonstrated to play a big role in inhibiting osteoclast activity long term, reducing bone breakdown.          Opposes the effect of PTH produced in the parathyroids.      Secreted by parafollicular cells (clear cells) which are adjacent to the follicular cells, and are of a different embryological origin from the follicular cells.        Has been shown to be important in fish, however studies in humans have been more mixed.          In patients with total thyroidectomies, where there is no calcitonin production, calcitonin replacement doesn’t seem to be necessary.        However, it is important to know that it is upregulated in medullary carcinoma.          We saw this last year as one possible thyroid screening test, in the Thyroid lecture.

If you have too much of the hormone, we try to suppress it.      Basics of EndocrinologyLecture Objectives  List the hormones produced by the pituitary gland.  Describe a hypothalamic-pituitary-end organ feedback loop.  Complete a grid of pituitary hormones and the effect of overproduction and underproduction of these hormones.The Endocrine System  The pituitary gland is basically the master regulator of a number of endocrine organs.          However, the pituitary gland itself is regulated by the hypothalamus.      There are negative feedback loops that keep hormone release under control.        There are a lot of interactions → things can get confusing.  Try to simplify things to the following:          What does the hormone do?      What happens when a hormone is under-produced?      What happens when a tumour is over-produced?      Modules  Thyroid Gland.          Hypothalamus released TRH → Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone.      TRH stimulates the Pituitary gland to produce TSH → Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.      This stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4 hormones.        Parathyroid Glands          Release of Parathyroid hormone in response to Calcium levels.      This actually isn’t regulated centrally by the hypothalamus, feedback it managed locally by the parathyroid glands themselves.        Adrenal Glands          CRH is released by the Hypothalamus.      This stimulates ACTH release by the Pituitary Gland.      ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, mineralicorticoids, glucocorticoids, etc.        Pituitary Gland, Growth &amp; Growth Hormone, Sexual Development &amp; Puberty          The reproduction component is left until the Reproduction block.      Looking at growth and growth hormone feedback loops.        Diabetes          Again, the pancreas has a feedback loop that doesn’t involve the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
