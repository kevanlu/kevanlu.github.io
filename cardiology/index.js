Thromboembolic RiskThis is due to disorganized mechanical function of the atria, leading to blood stasis.This is more worrisome in the left atria, because it goes to the systemic circulation, and to the brain!This is often worsened by causes of atrial fibrillation like mitral stenosis, which dilate the left atria &#8594; not only is the abnormal pumping leading to stasis, but there&#8217;s also more blood!Treatment:With atrial fibrillation, oftentimes anticoagulation prophylaxis is recommended.ASA &#8594; inhibits platelet aggregation.WarfarinThe CHADS2 scorePatients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter should go on prophylactic anticoagulation if they have one or more of:C &#8594; Congestive Heart FailureH &#8594; HypertensionA &#8594; Age over 75D &#8594; DiabetesS2 &#8594; Prior Stroke", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/02/13/atrial-fibrillation.html"},
	{"title": "Antiarrythmics", "text": "Review of the Mechanisms of ArrhythmiaCardiomyocytes are capable of endogenously triggering depolarization.Upslope of depolarization reaches a critical threshold. This triggers a movement of calcium (versus the sodium output that is seen typically), which causes repolarization.Arrythmias can occur because of abnormal automaticity, where this endogenous depolarization is dystfunctional, or reentry, where there is an alternative circuit through the heart that causes looping.How Antiarrythmics can affect automaticityDecrease the slope of Phase 4 depolarization &#8594; eg. Beta blockersIncrease threshold &#8594; eg. Ca2+ channel blockers.Prolong Action Potential &#8594; eg K+ channel blockers.Diastolic Potental &#8594; eg. Acetylcholine (vagal)Principles of Treating ArrhythmiasIdentify and treat precipitating factors.For instance, ischemic tissue.Activation of the sympathetic nervous system &#8594; shock, strenuous exercise.Electrolyte abnormalitiesDrugs that may be pro-arrythmic.Decide on your goal.Not all arrythmias need treating:Sinus tachycardia &#8594; you don&#8217;t need to treat the condition itself, because it&#8217;s almost always a sign of an underlying condition. If anything, this is usually a physiological response to an acute condition!Sinus bradycardia &#8594; This can be seen in athletes where exercise has increased parasympathetic tone!Atrial fibrillation with a controlled rate.Non-pharmacological therapy (electricity):A pacemaker in patients with a pathological bradycardia.Defibrillators for patients with severe arrhythmias.A general rule of thumb is:If the patient is stable &#8594; antiarrythmics are okay.If the patient is unstable &#8594; electrical interventions like defibrillators should be used.If the patient is dead &#8594; CPR, electricity, drugs, use everything!Rate or rhythm control can be done in atrial fibrillation.In the case of atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation would also be considered because it would increase the risk of having static flow in the atria due to impaired atrial systole.Minimize RisksLook for drug-drug interations.Try to choose dose to maximize effect and minimize side-effects. Many drugs have renal excretion, and a narrow therapeutic window.Some anti-arrythmics can actually have a pro-arrythmic effect:Drugs that prolong the QT-interval have a risk of causing torsades.Drugs that slow the heart rate have a risk of causing bradyarrythmias.Digoxin can cause arrythmias in toxic doses. You have to carefully titrate the dosage!Classification of Antiarrhythmic DrugsThere are 4 classes of antiarrhythmic drugs, following what is known as the Singh Vaughan Williams Classification:Class I: Na+ channel blockersClass II: Beta blockersClass III: K+ channel blockersClass IV: Ca2+ channel blockersSingh Vaughan Williams ClassificationClass I: Na+ channel blockersClass II: Beta blockersClass III: K+ channel blockersClass IV: Ca2+ channel blockers1. Class I Sodium Channel Blockersblock Na+ channels.affect phase 0 (rapid depolarization) in cardiac cells (non-nodal)decrease slope of phase 0, which prolongs the action potential and decreases the conduction velocitymay be useful for reentrant arrhythmias, by changing the rate of conduction through a limb in the circuit.RememberNa+ channel blockers slow the speed of phase 0, which prolongs action potentials.2. Class II Beta BlockersThese block &#946;-adrenergic receptors, as described previously.These act to slow the heart rate by:Increasing AV node conduction time.Prolonging AV node refractoriness.Modulating adrenergic tone.Basically, they destimulate the AV node.RememberBeta blockers function to destimulate the AV node &#8594; they slow AV conduction, and increase AV node refractoriness.3. Class III Potassium Channel BlockersThis slows the rate of repolarization, which was effected by potassium influx.Because they act to prolong action potentials by prolonging depolarization, they increase the QT interval.Hence potassium channel blockers should be closely monitored because they can cause Torsades!This prolonged depolarization does however act to prolong the refractory period, so they are also useful for re-entry arrythmias, where the difference in refractoriness is key in causing re-entry.RememberK+ channel blockers function to slow the rate of depolarization. This prolongs the QT, which has a risk for torsades.4. Class IV Calcium Channel BlockersAs mentioned in our lecture on Cardiovascular Pharmacology, there are two types of calcium channel blockers:Dihydropyridines &#8594; vascular selective, vasodilation.Nondihydropyridines &#8594; cardiac selective, affect the SA and AV nodes.In the case of arrythmias, we&#8217;d obviously use the nondihydropyridines only. These would include Verapamil and Diltiazem.You wouldn&#8217;t use the dihydropyridines (the &#8216;__pine&#8217; drugs), in these cases!They affect the sinus and AV node, by increasing the threshold to depolarization.Recall that phase 0 depolarization depends on a spontaneous influx of calcium ions.If calcium channels are blocked, then it&#8217;s harder to have this spontaneous depolarization!So Non-DHP CCBs have the following functions:Decreases AV node conduction velocityDecreases heart rate via the sinus node effect.RememberNondihydropyridine Calcium channel blockers such as Verapamil and Diltiazem, affect depolarization of nodal tissues, reducing AV node velocity and decreasing heart rate.Limitations of Singh Vaughan Williams ClassificationDrugs in the same class can act in several different waysFor example, amiodarone, and sotalol.Sotalol is a beta-blocker (hence the &#8216;lol&#8217; suffix), but it&#8217;s also a potassium channel blocker. So technically it&#8217;s both in Class II and Class III.Classification does not account for metabolites.For instance, the metabolite could work in a different way than the drug itself.It does not include digoxin and adenosine.Class I AntiarrythmicsClass I Antiarrythmics are split into:Class Ia &#8594; lengthens the action potential.Class Ib &#8594; shortens the action potential.Class Ic &#8594; has no effect on the action potential.Class Ia AntiarrythmicsOne example is Procainamide (Pronestyl).Na+ channel blocker, so it prolongs the AP, and slows conduction.However, it has anticholinergic side effects &#8594; recall SLUDGE.So it&#8217;s not really used in chronic cases. Typically used in acute cases.Generally used for supraventricular and ventricular arrythmias.Has a risk of proarrythmic effects.Class Ib AntiarrythmicsOne example is Lidocaine.Lidocaine is an older drug that blocks subtypes of sodium channels specific to the ventricle (and is also used as a local anesthetic).Hence it&#8217;s used only in ventricular arrythmias.It seems to be particularly selective for ischemic tissue.Not used prophylactically with MI, because it can be toxic.Lidocaine has a hugely variable half life &#8594; patients with CHF with poor perfusion will have a long half life!We only use it intravenously &#8594; it has no function orally, because it&#8217;ll be metabolized by the liver (recall that it&#8217;ll go from the gut &#8594; portal vein &#8594; liver &#8594; systemic circulation).Lidocaine toxicityCNS problems &#8594; seizures.Cardiovascular collapse.Class I AntiarrythmicsClass Ia = procainamide.Class Ib = lidocaine.RememberLidocaine (Class Ib) is selective for the ventricle, so it&#8217;s only used for ventricular arrythmias (especially with ischemia).Class II AntiarrythmicsThese are the beta-blockers, as described before.The &#8216;___lol&#8217; drugs would all fit here &#8594; propanolol, metoprolol, labetolol, carvedilol, etc.By blocking sympathetic innervation, we reduce the conduction rate through the AV node.This makes beta-blockers useful for rate control in atrial fibrillation, re-entry arrythmias, etc.Class III Antiarrythmics1. AmiodaroneAmiodarone is theoretically a Class III Antiarrythmic.But in fact, Amiodarone has a bit of everything! Has a Class I-IV behaviour!This actually reduces the risk of a long-QT caused by the potassium channel blocking &#8594; it seems as if the other behaviour moderates the risk.So amiodarone will have less of a proarrythmic effect than other Class III medications.RememberAmiodarone is typically classified as a Class III antiarrythmic, but it actually has behaviour from all 4 classes!Clinically, amiodarone is used for atrial fibrillation, and ventricular arrythmias (much like every other antiarrythmic)!Amiodarone is the drug of choice in patients with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation that are refractory to electical shock therapy.Amiodarone has a huge half life (months) and tends to accumulate in tissues. - So when you treat a patient with it, to get them to therapeutic levels quickly, you start with a high loading dose over a couple of weeks, and then follow up with a maintenance dose.Chronically, amiodarone is famous for a rare side effect of causing pulmonary fibrosis &#8594; scarring of the lungs.Bleomycin, Amiodarone, and Nitrofurantoin are the big examples of drugs that can cause IPF.See the lecture on Diffuse Interstitial Lung Diseases.RememberChronic use of amiodarone can sometimes cause pulmonary fibrosis.Since amiodarone also has an iodine moiety in it, it can also cause effects on the thyroid:Hyperthyroidism.Hypothyroidism.Either can actually happen &#8594; it&#8217;s not that predictable. So we actually have to monitor the patients thyroid function (TSH, etc), and adjust accordingly.Amiodarone can also cause pigmentation of the skin &#8594; obviously not a great side-effect.You&#8217;ll look purplish and &#8216;smurfy&#8217;.Since amiodarone has such broad effects, it also has a wide range of adverse drug interactions.Adverse Effects of AmiodaroneChronic use has a small risk of causing IPF.Pigmentation of the skin.Effects on the thyroid due to the presence of an iodine moiety.2. DronedaroneThere&#8217;s a new drug called Dronedarone which has recently hit the market that is similar to amiodarone, but doesn&#8217;t have the iodine moiety. It also has a much shorter half life.Theoretically, this means that it shouldn&#8217;t have the thyroid toxicity.It also seems to show less tissue accumulation, since it&#8217;s less lipophilic.Since it&#8217;s only recently been made available, we&#8217;re not yet certain what its role is.3. SotalolTechnically both Class II and Class III &#8594; it&#8217;s also a non-selective beta-blocker.It blocks inward potassium channels, prolonging the QT, and suppressing phase 4 depolarization.Clinically it&#8217;s used with ventricular arrythmias or atrial fibrillation, but not too often, because it has the risk of torsades.Recall that most Class III antiarrythmics have this risk of Torsades because they prolong the QT interval.4. New Class III AntiarrythmicsDofetilide.Ibutilide.There are IV drugs with a rapid onset of action, that are used to terminate atrial fibrillation (chemical cardioversion).They have a significant risk of Torsades because they prolong the QT, so they&#8217;re only really used by Cardiology.Class IV AntiarrythmicsThese are the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.As mentioned, they include:Verapamil,Diltiazem.Since they have an effect on AV node conduction (along with SA node conduction), they&#8217;re very useful for re-entry arrythmias and rate control for A-fib.Class IV AntiarrythmicsRe-entry arrythmias (Non-DHP CCBs slow AV node conduction).Rate Control with Atrial Fibrillation (Non-DHP CCBs reduce SA node automaticity).AdenosineRecall that adenosine is a nucleoside &rarr; it consists of a nucleic acid plus a 5-carbon sugar. A nucleotide is a nucleoside with 1-3 phosphate groups as well.Used to block conduction through the AV node completely.As a result, it can often cause asystole &#8594; not a good thing!But the half life is very short, at around 10 seconds, so you just have to wait (and pray), and they should recover.Used as an IV bolus.Clinically, it&#8217;s used for:Re-entry supraventricular tachycardias.Diagnosing wide complex tachycardia.If adenosine stops it, the ectopic pacing must be supraventricular.If adenosine doesn&#8217;t stop it, then the ectopic pacing must occur below the AV node.DigoxinAs mentioned in Cardiovascular Pharmacology I, Digoxin has two functions:Inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase.Indirect PSNS (vagal) effects.As an antiarrythmic, we use its indirect vagal effect.It slows the conduction through the AV node.This slows the rate in atrial fibrillation.RememberDigoxin has two functions:Inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase &#8594; used to increase myocardial contractility.Indirect PSNS (Vagal) effects &#8594; used to treat atrial fibrillation.So the only antiarrythmic role for digoxin is to slow the rate in atrial fibrillation.Digoxin isn&#8217;t even a very useful antiarrythmic &#8594; this vagal effect is easily overcome in patients with high sympathetic tone (ie, if they&#8217;re nervous, exercising, etc).Used more for patients with atrial fibrillation that are more sedentary.It also has a narrow therapeutic range, so there&#8217;s a risk for digitalis toxicity, which can have proarrythmic effects.SummaryGeneral Rules of ThumbDon&#8217;t combine agents in the same classIf you&#8217;re using metoprolol for a patient with CHF, then you wouldn&#8217;t give them sotalol for their arrythmia as well.Don&#8217;t combine agents with the same side effectsFor instance, multiple drugs that cause bradycardia, or a long QT, can exacerbate the effects &#8594; could be dangerous!For instance a beta-blocker with a Non-DHP CCB (both slow conduction through the AV node).Question 1Which of the following would be useful in controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation?Lidocaine &#8594; ventricular fibrillation only! Class Ib specific for ventricular tissue.Verapamil &#8594; both verapamil and diltiazem are Non-DHP CCBs, so they&#8217;d slow conduction through the AV node.DiltiazemAmiodarone &#8594; useful for just about everything arrythmic, can&#8217;t go wrong there!Metoprolol &#8594; slows conduction through the AV node.Digoxin &#8594; digoxin&#8217;s only antiarrythmic role.Adenosine &#8594; technically it would&#8230; for 5 seconds. Would be useful in halting a re-entry arrythmia, but not a chronic one.Question 2A patient presents with a BP of 70 and the following ECG. What would the ideal therapy be?Tachycardia &#8594; &#62; 100 bpm.Wide QRS &#8594; &#62; 120ms (3 small boxes).So this is a wide complex tachycardia.This could either be supraventricular or ventricular.A good clinical rule of thumb is to always assume it&#8217;s a ventricular tachycardia, because they&#8217;re the more dangerous ones!Since the patient is hypotensive and we&#8217;re treating it like it&#8217;s a ventricular tachycardia, the patient isn&#8217;t stable!We&#8217;d use shock therapy!Recall, we had that:RememberA general rule of thumb is:If the patient is stable &#8594; antiarrythmics are okay.If the patient is unstable &#8594; electrical interventions like defibrillators should be used.If the patient is dead &#8594; CPR, electricity, drugs, use everything!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/02/12/antiarrythmics.html"},
	{"title": "Mechanism of Arrythmia", "text": "Arrythmia electrical physiology is pretty straightforward:If you have Bradycardia, it could be:sinus node dysfunctionAV blockIf you have Tachycardia, it could be:narrow complexwide complexThe aims of diagnosis are to find out if:If the patients symptoms are due to an arrythmiaIf the arrythmia is benign or malignant.History is the most important diagnostic tool for arrythmias!Rate of onset/offset of symptomsGradual vs. abrupt presentationProdrome vs. no prodromeprodrome = early symptoms that may appear before the start of a disease.Electrical Physiology of ArrythmiasThe electrical system has two functions:Impulse initiationFailure to initiate can cause bradycardia &#8594; &#8216;too slow&#8217;Abnormal rapid repetitive initiation causes tachycardia &#8594; &#8216;too fast&#8217;Impulse ConductionFailure to conduct to all parts of the heart can cause bradycardia &#8594; eg a conduction blockCircular conduction can cause rapid repetitive activity and tachycardia.An arrythmia can occur because of a problem in either of these &#8594; abnormal impulse initiation (automaticity), or abnormal conduction!RememberArrythmias can be classified as either abnormal automaticity or abnormal conduction!Normal Conduction &amp; AnatomySinus Node = Sinoatrial node.The impulse is initiated at the SA node (automaticity)This impulse spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium via Bachmann&#8217;s bundlesThe SA node impulse then travels to the AV node, which slows down the signal, and then sends it to the His Purkinje SystemThe Purkinje fibres are split into two bundle branches:The left bundle branch has two fascicles &#8594; an anterior and a posterior one.The right bundle branch has one fascicleThe right and left ventricle are simultaneously activated via the His Purkinje system. (via the right and left bundle branches respectively)SummarySA (initiation) &#8594; AV (slowing) &#8594; His Purkinje &#8594; LV &amp; RVAutomaticitySpecialized cardiac tissue possesses the ability to spontaneously initiate impulse (spontaneous depolarization)The one that has the ability to produce this impulse the fastest will be the one that controls the impulse! This is why the sinus node is what triggers the impulse!An example is the SA node.It determines when and how quickly the heart beats.Under normal physiological stimuli, the heart beat will accelerate and decelerate, based on neural control.SA Node Action PotentialThe sinus node conducts action potentials in a different way than typical cardiomyocytes, which we saw in the lecture on Cardiac Electrical Physiology.Phase 4 &#8594; Spontaneous depolarizationBecause of a spontaneous leak of calcium ions into the cell.Phase 0 &#8594; DepolarizationOnce the cross-membrane voltage difference reaches a threshold .potential, there is positive reinforcement.This positive reinforcement involves the opening of more calcium gated voltage channels, changing the slope of the voltage-time curve.Phase 1 &#8594; Plateau.Phase 2 &#38; 3 &#8594; Repolarization.Potassium begins to be pumped out once voltage gated potassium channels open.The slope of the phase 4 current and the threshold level are what determine the firing rate of the SA node.Changing the rate of AutomaticityChanging the rate of current leak &#8594; as we mentioned before, if we change the slope of the phase 4 current (spontaneous depolarization), then the rate of SA automaticity will change.Changing the threshold &#8594; a lower threshold will increase the rate, and a higher threshold will slow the rate.Changing the rate of AutomaticityChanging the rate of Phase 4 current leakFaster leakage &#8594; faster rate.Slower leakage &#8594; slower rate.Changing the thresholdLower threshold &#8594; faster rate.Higher threshold &#8594; slower rate.The Hierarchy of Pacemaker AutomaticityRecall that as we said before, what starts the impulse is the Sinus Node, as it produces the fastest rate.However, there are other regions of the heart that can also automatically pace, albeit at a slower rate than the sinus node.This is protective! If the sinus node gives out at any time, there&#8217;ll be a (slower) fallback that can trigger the impulse!One example is a junctional escape rhythm, where the AV node takes over pacing.When we fall-back to one of these accessory nodes (AV node or His-Purkinje), there will be bradycardia, since bradycardia = HR &#60; 60 bpm.An easy way to ballpark the rates for these alternative foci is that the sinus node is 60+ bpm, the AV node is 40-60 bpm, and the His-Purkinje system is 20-40 bpm.        	Pacemaker    	Endogenous Rate            	Sinus Node    	60+ bpm            	AV Node    	40-60 bpm            	His-Purkinje System    	20-40 bpm    We can also have ectopic pacing from cardiomyocytes, either in the atrium, or from the ventricle. These will have abnormal rates.Pacemaker Automaticity HierarchySinus Node &#8594; 60+ bpm.AV Node &#8594; 40-60 bpm.His-Purkinje &#8594; 20-40 bpm.Environmental Determinants of AutomaticityThe nature of the automaticity can change with environmental conditions.For instance, warming in the AV node can increase the rate of depolarization, increasing the heart rate.Abnormal AutomaticityAutomaticity can be pathologically suppressed causing bradycardia.Sinus node disease (aging / sick sinus syndrome) &#8594; caused by scarring and fibrosis in the sinus node, which can be due to aging.Metabolic conditions causing reduced sinus node automaticity. One example is renal failure causing hyperkalemia, which changes conduction.Tissues can become automatic under pathologic conditions.Atrial tachycardia &#8594; an ectopic atrial focus rapidly and repetitively fires.During myocardial ischemia/infarction ventricular muscle may develop automaticity and cause ventricular tachycardia.Arrythmia ExampleThis patient has atrial fibrillation, followed by overdrive suppression.Disorganized atrial impulses cause a rapid heart rate, which results in hyperpolarization causing a refractory period.The cells then take a while before they can depolarize again.Also, note that we don&#8217;t have escape rhythms from the AV node or His-Purkinje system &#8594; there are no QRS complexes firing after suppression!This is more generally known as Tachy Brady Syndrome &#8594; tachycardia followed by bradycardia due to overdrive suppression.Atrial TachycardiaAtrial tissue under diseased conditions can devleop spontaneous depolarization.This can cause rapid and repetitive firing, which supplants the sinus node rate, and becomes the pacemaker of the heart.This results in tachycardia.On an ECG, the P-waves would have a funny axis, because they&#8217;re originating from an ectopic location.Treatment is either medication to suppress the automaticity, or catheter ablation to burn the ectopic foci.Ventricular TachycardiaIf the ectopic automatic focus developes in the ventricular muscle or the His-Purkinje system, then ventricular tachycardia develops.Myocardial ischemia can cause this to occur.On an ECG, this will often manifest as a wide complex QRS because the foci will originate in the ventricles, instead of conducting from the AV node down the His-Purkinje system.Ventricular tachycardia was also often seen post-thrombolytic therapy (Streptokinase, TNK-tPA) &#8594; the area that is re-perfused would often show an elevated idioventricular rhythm.This is less common now because catheter-mediated PCI is the standard of care now in tertiary care centres.An elevated idioventricular rhythm was actually how we knew that thrombolytic therapy worked!Reentry Arrhythmia&#8217;sAs we said before, an arrhythmia can either be because of abnormal impulse initiation, or abnormal conduction.Atrial tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia were types of abnormal automaticity.Reentry is a type of abnormal conduction.With reentry, there is re-stimulation of the cardiac muscle due to circular conduction abnormalities.The impulse effectively conducts in a circle and excites itself.It&#8217;s a common cause of tachycardia, but doesn't cause bradycardia.This makes sense &#8594; If the ectopic loop takes longer than the pacing of the heart, then the pacing is going to &#8216;win&#8217; anyway!An Example of Re-entryHere is an image showing normal conduction through the heart.A signal conducts down to the AV node, where it&#8217;s slowed, and then goes down into the His-Purkinje system.With a re-entry tachycardia, there is an additional accessory pathway, that an impulse could potentially return through.So to have a re-entry tachycardia, we require 2 limbs:A slow limb (typically through the AV node).A normal/fast limb (typically an accessory pathway).There also needs to be a difference in their refractoriness &#8594; how quickly they recover!When there is an accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles, this is referred to as Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW).This sets up the potential for a loop &#8594; an impulse can go down the AV node, but return back up the short circuit, causing a cycle!This is AV-node re-entry tachycardia.Wolf Parkinson-White-SyndromeWhen there is an accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles.This may not necessarily cause an arrythmia &#8594; you need a specific combination of refractoriness and conduction rates to have one.In a patient with WPW, since there are now 2 pathways from the atria to the ventricles, there&#8217;s a slurring of the upstroke of the QRS, known as a delta wave.This is because an impulse will now travel down both pathways, and since the accessory pathway is faster, it&#8217;ll have a more positive deflection early on in the complex.However, since this pathway doesn&#8217;t travel down the specialized His-Purkinje system, this earlier deflection will have a shallower slope.This manifests as a fusion between an early wide QRS and a narrow QRS &#8594; a delta wave.RefractorinessCardiac tissue is unique in that it has a long phase of recovery after it is activated &#8594; a long &#8216;refractory period&#8217; &#8594; refractoriness.This was caused by the shape of the action potential, with its long recovery phase.All ventricular muscle is activated in 80ms but it takes ~400 ms for the muscle to be able to be re‐stimulated. (This is the QT interval)This prevents re-stimulation of tissue and is &#8220;anti-tachycardic&#8221; &#8594; it acts to reduce the risk of cycles of self-propagating conduction from occurring.How does Re-Entry Occur?If we have an accessory pathway, how does re-entry occur?We mentioned that in a normal beat, an impulse will just travel down both pathways.To trigger a re-entry tachycardia, the following must happen:The initial trigger is the firing of a premature beat.At this point, the accessory pathway is still refractory, but the AV node has already recovered.This is why we needed differing refractoriness between the two pathways!The conduction then travels down the AV node only, where it is slowed.During this time, the accessory pathway will have recovered, so by the time it goes all the way around, it can go back through the accessory pathway.Since the first pathway recovers quickly, we can re-enter it once we go back through the accessory pathway &#8594; this is our re-entry.This re-entry tachycardia can be stopped by:Chance &#8594; the loop may fortuitously meet a refractory AV node that stops the looping.Changing the refractoriness through the AV node &#8594; extrinsic stimulation medications or vagal maneuvers can change the degree of refractoriness through the AV node, blocking the loop.Vagal Maneuvers are maneuvers that change parasympathetic tone &#8594; one examples is massaging of the baroreceptors, triggering a vasovagal response.Adenosine can be used because it can cause a transient AV-node block, which blocks re-entry.Where are these accessory pathways located?These accessory pathways can occur in any region between the atria and ventricles.The location of the pathway affects our treatment, especially with catheter ablation of the ectopic foci.If the accessory pathway is near the AV node (anteroseptal), then catheter ablation could potentially cause a complete AV-block, necessitating a pacemaker.So anteroseptal pathways would be difficult to treat via catheter ablation!Not all ectopic pathways can conduct in both directions.The ectopic pathway needs to conduct down to see a delta wave.The ectopic pathway needs to conduct up for potential re-entry.This means that re-entry can occur in a patient that does not have a delta wave!Re-Entry Initiation with WPWThe classic patient with Wolf-Parkinson-White, in sinus rhythm.Here, conduction travels down both pathways.This is effectively the same as normal conduction, except with a delta-wave due to the impulse travelling down the ectopic foci.No re-entry occurs hereHere, a premature beat occurs but both limbs (&#945; and &#946;) are refractory.Since both limbs are refractory, the premature beat is blocked.This premature beat does not travel to the ventricles at all, so you&#8217;ll have a P-wave with no associated QRS complex.No re-entry occurs hereA premature beat can come down the &#945; limb, but can&#8217;t come back up the &#946; limb because it&#8217;s still refractory.Since it won&#8217;t complete the loop, this is effectively the same as a normal beat.No re-entry occurs here &#8594; the loop isn&#8217;t completed.A premature beat can come down the &#945; limb, and because of the difference in conduction speed and refractoriness, it can then go back up the &#946; limb, causing a circuit.This is the only one that will actually result in a re-entry tachycardia!This is the usual pattern of re-entry &#8594; down the slow, up the fast.It can occur in the other direction, but it&#8217;s more rare.Re-entry does occur.In other words, having an accessory pathway does not mean that you will have re-entry tachycardia!You need the right timing, refractoriness, and conduction speed, in order for re-entry to occur.Types of Re-Entrant Supraventricular TachycardiasOrthodromic Re-entrant Tachycardia &#8594; down the slow, up the fast.Antidromic Re-entrant Tachycardia &#8594; down the fast, up the slow.Orthodromic = same direction as a normal impulse.Antidromic = opposite direction of a normal impulse.Requirements for Re-entryA Potential Circuit &#8594; eg. two conduction limbs.Differing RefractorinessSlow conduction in one region &#8594; this lets previously refractory tissue recover and become re-excited.Temporary Conduction Block in One Direction &#8594; prevents the impulse from travelling in the same direction down both limbs.AV-Nodal Re-entry TachycardiaSome people have a slow pathway and a fast pathway within the AV node itself.With an AV-nodal re-entry, both limbs are in the AV node.Ventricular Re-entry Tachycardia in a Healed MIScar tissue from an MI can set up the properties needed for re-entry.The scar tissue itself can have different refractoriness and conduction.Often a late complication of an MI &#8594; Ventricular Tachycardia.The problem here is that the scar still conducts, but slowly and abnormally, setting up the risk of re-entry.Treatment often involves &#8216;finishing off the scar&#8217; &#8594; ablating it so it loses all of its conductive properties.Triggered ActivityThis is a rare cause of tachycardia, but a serious one!Triggered Activity is an abnormality of impulse initiation, due to abnormalities in ionic currents.This causes repeated firing due to abnormalities in refractoriness.Patients with a long QT-interval are at risk for this.Automaticity vs Triggered ActivityAutomaticity &#8594; spontaneous impulse initiation (no external stimulus).Triggered Activity &#8594; repetitive firing triggered by abnormal action potentials (caused by abnormal currents).Torsades de PointesTorsades de pointes = dangerous lethal arrhythmias.With a long QT-interval, different areas of the ventricle can have disparities in when they depolarize.This can cause partial depolarization while other areas are still repolarizingWhen these meet, this can cause depolarization on repolarization &#8594; the R-on-T phenomenon.This can then cause one spike, or several spikes &#8594; if several spikes occurs, then it&#8217;ll manifest as Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia.Torsades de Pointes itself is a triad of findings, including polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.So even if you have the classic, winding ECG, it&#8217;s not sufficient to be called Torsades &#8594; it&#8217;d only be a polymorphic VT!To qualify as Torsades, you require:Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia &#8594; the winding ECG.Long-QT Interval &#8594; depolarizations on repolarizations.Bradycardia or Pause Dependent Tachycardia &#8594; you jump into and out of the winding ECG behaviour.With these patients, you need to shorten their QT and increase their heart rate &#8594; will be discussed in future lectures.An ECG strip showing Torsades de Pointes.Torsades de PointesTo qualify as Torsades de Pointes, you require:Polymorphic Ventricular TachycardiaLong-QT IntervalBradycardia or Pause Dependent Tachycardia", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/02/12/mechanism-arrythmia.html"},

	{"title": "Heart Failure III", "text": "An overview of the studies that have been done on the first line pharmacological agents that are used in treating heart failure. These include Aldosterone inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and Beta-blockers.Is heart failure really a disease of the heart, or is it a disease of the endocrine system?Acutely, neurohumoral activation can be beneficial, but chronically, it can be problematic.Some examples of neurohormonal activation include:Norepinephrine &#8594; inhibited by &#946; blockersAngiotensin II &#8594; inhibited by ACEI, ARBAldosterone &#8594; inhibited by SpironolactoneEndothelin &#8594; inhibited by ET antagonistsVasopressin &#8594; inhibited by VP antagonistsShort term, these compensatory responses are good, but long term, they can lead to the following deleterious side-effects:HypertrophyApoptosisIschemiaArrhythmiasHeart remodelingFibrosisFluid RetentionHence, the medications we use to block neurohumoral activation can be beneficial to long term survival.This lecture will focus on important clinical trials, and the experimental evidence behind the use of each of these drugs.Studies on Pharmacological Agents for CHF1. Aldosterone InhibitorsIf you reduce the effect of Aldosterone, can you improve the survival of patients with congestive heart failure?Spironolactone: A study showed a statistically significant improvement in survival after 12-months.Eplerenone: Aimed to reduce negative side-effects such as gynecomastia (breast tissue enlargement) in men, which occurred in around 5% of patients on Spironolactone.Showed to be similarly effective as Spironolactone.Also vastly more expensive!2. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme InhibitorsRecall that ACE inhibitors reduce levels of angiotensin II, which reduces aldosterone levels, and causes vasodilation. It also blocks breakdown of bradykinin to inactive peptide fragments.Enalapril: A landmark study called CONSENSUS showed that ACEI markedly reduced the probability of death after 12-months for patients with severe congestive heart failure.Another study (The SOLVD Prevention Trial) with patients with no history of overt heart failure, showed that preventative treatment with enalapril reduced progression to heart failure!3. Angiotensin Receptor BlockersRecall that Angiotensin Receptor Blockers block the Angiotensin 1 Receptor, and has the same downstream effects as ACEI, without the reduction in bradykinin breakdownRecall that ARB is used when patients have a cough or angioedema with ACEI, because of the bradykinin accumulation!A study called CHARM: Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction of Mortality and MorbidityThe study was done in ACEI intolerant patients, because otherwise it would be unethical to do this study because of the clear mortality benefits of ACEI.Again, Candesartan performed better than placebo with regards to survival in CHF.4. Beta-BlockersBeta blockers block the effect of circulating catecholamines.Persistent SNS stimulation has been shown to be both directly cardiotoxic, and indirectly cardiotoxic due to resultant increased myocardial oxygen demand and preload.It can also cause disturbances in cardiac rhythm.The image on the right shows how increased levels of plasma norephinephrine can result in reduced survival over time.A number of trials were done to look at the efficacy of &#946;-blockers in CHF, including the CIBIS-II trial, the MERIT-HF trial, and the US carvedilol program.All of them were stopped prematurely, due to efficacy &#8212; there was a substantial reduction in all-cause mortality in all 3 studies!Interventional Treatment of CHF1. Bi-Ventricular PacingThe above is an example of a left bundle branch block.There&#8217;s an obviously wide QRS complex, and the S-wave is sharply negative in V1, V2 &amp; V3.This suggests flow away from the right side of the heart &#8594; a left bundle branch block.This can cause abnormal interventricular septal wall motion because the right ventricle moves at a different time than the left ventricle.This then reduces the ejection force, reducing the EF and CO.Obviously, this is bad in patients with CHF!To treat this, we can use bi-ventricular pacingYou basically attach pacemaker leads to the outside of the heart, via coronary veins.One attaches to the left ventricle, and one attaches to the right ventricleThe goal of this is to get the left and right ventricle to contract at the same time.This bi-ventricular pacing can be seen to improve the pumping of the heart via echocardiographic analysis.Studies show that this improves NYHA class, quality of life, and LV function.Hence, in patients with CHF and a wide QRS, bi-ventricular pacing can significantly improve heart function!2. Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs)ICDs can detect fatal arrythmias, and restore normal sinus rhythm!Studies show that ICDs can have a marked reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with CHF and arrythmia.These devices can often be combined with a bi-ventricular pacemaker so you have a pacing function as well as a defibrillating function.This gives you pacing support as well as resynchronization support.3. Ventricular Assist DevicesThese are basically mechanical bridges to transplantation.In cases where the only reasonable avenue to take is a heart transplant due to severe congestive heart failure, a ventricular assist device can be a stop-gap treatment while waiting for a transplant.With a VAD, blood is taken from the failing ventricle, and pumped into the aorta. It&#8217;s basically a supplemental artifical heart.The image on the right is of an older pneumatic device. Newer devices are continuous flow devices that pump blood continuously.4. Heart TransplantWhen a patient has end-stage heart failure, then their long-term prognosis is very poor, and a heart transplant is often the best way to go.There is a short-term drop in survival compared to those who don&#8217;t have surgery, due to surgical complications.But long-term, as you can see, the prognosis is much better.Note that the half-life of a transplant is only 10-12 years.If you&#8217;re lucky enough to survive the first 3 months though, the half-life is more like 14-15 years.Moreover, the quality-of-life improves dramatically in those with a transplant &#8594; they can do strenuous activity, exercise, etc.Summary of Treatment for CHFThe flowchart below describes the treatment plan for patients with systolic heart failure (EF &#60; 35-40%)When the patient is acutely presenting, you usually stabilize them with diuretics. Typically this is a loop-diuretic like Lasix (furosemide).Once they&#8217;ve stabilized, we continue as follows:Treatment Plan for CHF", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/02/11/heart-failure-3.html"},
	{"title": "Heart Failure II", "text": "Non-pharmacologically, heart failure treatment involves making lifestyle changes, and educating the patient. Pharmacologically, we aim to attenuate the neurohormonal responses that the body has in response to reduced cardiac output.The general principles of treating heart failure are the following:Relieve symptomsHalt or reverse progression of diseaseImprove survivalPrevent complicationsIf any of the conditions are treatable, aim to correct those first! Some examples of correctable conditions are:Reversible myocardial ischemia (myocardial hibernation)Valvular heart diseaseUncontrolled hypertensionAnemia/endocrineInappropriate medicationsNon-Pharmacological Treatment for CHFLifestyle corrections are most importantIf the patient doesn&#8217;t adhere to these, any pharmacological intervention is doomed to failure!Lifestyle Changes:diet (sodium restriction)fluid restrictionalcohol restrictionexerciseEducation:heart function clinicsLifestyle1. Sodium RestrictionSince patients are in a state of profound sodium retention, which causes fluid retention &#8594; BP&#8593;, the main goal is to reduce sodium consumptionAim to drop patient sodium intake to &leq;3000 mg (130 mmol)/dayIf the patient doesn&#8217;t improve with &leq;3000 mg, or a diuretic like furosemide is being prescribed, then a restriction of &leq;2000 mg is required.Patients should try to reduce salt in cooking, and avoid high-sodium foods, like canned foods, crackers, condiments, frozen dinners, and cheese.Beware of salt substitutes like potassium chloride, which also can cause health problems (eg. hyperkalemia)In patients with heart failure, salt = death!!2. Fluid RestrictionCase ExampleMrs. S. presents with ankle swellingKnown dilated cardiomyopathyFaithful with salt restrictionGood medical therapySerum sodium 128 (normal 135-145 mmol/L)Patient has some peripheral edemaThis reduces the serum sodium concentration because of fluid dilution.We don&#8217;t want to increase sodium consumption, and instead, we should aim to restrict fluid consumptionThis is especially true for patients on diuretics, which tend to make patients want to drink water!3. Alcohol RestrictionLV performance is reduced after drinking alcohol.For instance, the figure on the right demonstrates that both LVEDV and LVEDP increase shortly after drinking, suggesting that the LV is pumping less effectively.Hence chronic alcoholism can affect LV function!4. ExercisePatients and physicians often have misconceptions as to the risks of exercise with congestive heart failure.Aerobic capacity and quality of life indices generally show an improvement with exercise training.Although exercise does not show a dramatic improvement in heart function, it does reduce endothelial dysfunction and improves skeletal muscle blood flowExercise also reduces sympathetic activity, and Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone System activity.Exercise has been shown to not be harmful even with more advanced heart failure.Hence, although exercise doesn&#8217;t improve cardiac function, it does make other bodily systems better!EducationHeart Function ClinicsPatient education:Understanding the implications of heart failureProper monitoring, such as daily weighingRationizing their medications, and how to take them properly.Informing them of medications to avoidSuggesting diet/lifestyle changesPatient follow-up:frequent visits/reinforcementoptimization of medicationsearly intervention for negative behaviourPharmacological Treatment for Heart FailurePharmacological treatments target 3 areas:Cardiac function (contractility)Vasoconstriction and Na+/H2O retentionNeurohumoral activationCardiac FunctionDigitalis (Digoxin): Discovered in 1899. Improves ventricular function and ventricular contractility.Used without any actual clinical trials backing up its effectiveness, until around 1997.Digoxin was shown to have a negligible effect on mortality, but was shown to definitively slow progression of heart failure and reduce hospitalization. Milrinone: After the success of digoxin, pharmaceutical companies aimed to find other positive inotropic drugs that would improve contractility.Milrinone was one of these drugs. It was shown to improve heart function and make patients feel better.However, studies later showed that milrinone killed people!Patients on milrinone showed reduced survival probabilities than those on a placebo!Sadly, it was later shown that almost every positive inotropic drug that was tested showed increased mortality in CHF.Some examples include Xamoterol, Dobutamine, Ibopamine, etc.The only postive-inotropic drug we use now is basically just digoxin.In the short term, dobutamine and milrinone still have a role!Preload ReductionDiureticsDiuretics act on different regions of the renal tubule!For instance, furosemide acts on the loop of the renal tubule (it&#8217;s a loop diuretic), while thiazides act on the distal region of the tubule.By combining diuretics, we can increase fluid reduction at all regions of the renal tubule!VasodilatorsVenous Vasodilators &#8594; NitratesArterial Vasodilators &#8594; HydralazineMixed Vasodilators &#8594; Calcium antagonists, ACEI, ARBNitrates, and other vasodilators are shown to have a short term hemodynamic benefit.However, they seem to have limited long-term effects!It is also difficult to obtain optimal therapeutic doses because of side-effects.Nitrates may however be useful for symptom control.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/02/11/heart-failure-2.html"},
	{"title": "Physiology of Heart Failure", "text": "Overview of CHFHeart failure is a syndrome, not a disease. A lot of different mechanisms can cause heart failure!Broadly speaking, heart failure is where the heart can&#8217;t supply enough blood for the needs of the body.CHF will become an epidemic in the next couple of decades due to the aging population.It can&#8217;t be cured with relief of congestive symptoms &#8594; once your heart starts failing, it doesn&#8217;t get better!Recall that we have systolic failure = weak pump, and diastolic failure = weak filling. The image on the right compares and contrasts the two.50% of patients with NYHA class III/IV CHF die of arrythmia!Why does the heart dilate with volume overload?When the radius of the heart increases, a smaller percentage change in the radius during ventricular contraction can yield a larger ejection fraction.Note that a smaller percentage change in wall length above yielded a greater change in volume!This means that cardiac output can be maintained with a decrease in contractility, to a certain extent.Physiological Changes in Heart FailureThe normal collagen network is degradedTNF produced by dying tissue degrades collagen in tissue.This normally allows for the infiltration of cells into necrotic tissue so it can be cleaned up.In the heart, this can be problematic. Excess TNF chews apart a heart&#8217;s normal collagenous network.Fibrosis due to RAAS remodeling occurs.Aldosterone increases fibrous tissue production in the heart.However, this new fibrous tissue isn&#8217;t laid along the axis of the muscle bundles &#8594; this new fibrous tissue is usually distributed in a random fashion.Hence, we have abnormal fibrous tissue forming with prolonged RAAS stimulation.SummaryTNF produced by necrotic tissue eats up our good collagen meshwork.Remodeling due to the RAAS system lays down a new ineffective fibrous network.Reduction of Gap Junctions between MyocytesCardiac muscles communicate via. Gap Junctions.The archetypical one is Cx-43 (Connexin 43) &#8594; the 43 is because it&#8217;s around 43 kilodaltons.Because wide spreading of TNF due to necrotic tissue could cause widespread cardiac damage, a compensatory response to necrosis is the loss of gap junctions.As a result ischemia leading to tissue damage reduces connectivity between cardiomyocytes.This increases the risk of arrythmia by allowing for slow conduction zones which are one of the main causes of re-entry zones in arrythmia.Here, gap junctions are fluorescently labelled in red. The left is in a normal heart, and the right is in an ischemic heart.Increased Sympathetic and Neurohormonal EnervationConsider a case of acute blood loss:Hemorrhage &#8594; decreased venous return &#8594; reduced cardiac filling &#8594; reduced stroke volume &#8594; reduced cardiac output &#8594; lowered MAP.How does the body respond?The baroreflex can compensate, by sympathetic enervation of the heart.We can also increase venous tone via. &#945;-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation.Persistent stimulation causes a neurohormonal response &#8594; RAAS, vasopressin, etc.In the case of CHF, we have a further decrease in SV, CO, and MAP, so we have an even stronger sympathetic and neurohormonal response.This can be cardiotoxic over time!Responses by Low and High Pressure BaroreceptorsRecall that we had high pressure baroreceptors in the carotid and aortic arch.We also have low pressure baroreceptors in the right atrium that result in the production of atrial natriuretic peptide (as we saw before).When the RA stretches because of volume overload, there&#8217;s a signal to the hypothalamus, triggering a reduction in ADH release.This causes an increase in the glomerular filtration rate, increasing fluid loss from the body, reducing the blood volume.Treating Heart FailureA good analogy for this is a weak horse.What do we do?Positive inotropes &#8594; whip the horse.Vasodilators &#8594; unload the wagon.&#946;-blockers &#8594; slow the horse.Heart Transplant &#8594; get a new horse.Get a tractor &#8594; artificial heart.Our goal is to heal the horse (heal the heart).

	{"title": "Heart Failure I", "text": "Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is incapable of maintaining a cardiac output adequate to provide for metabolic requirements and unable to accomodate the venous return.Heart Failure: A condition in which the heart is incapable of maintaining a cardiac output adequate to provide for metabolic requirements and unable to accomodate the venous return.Clinically, heart failure is a syndrome in which reduced heart function is associated with diminished exercise capacity, a higher incidence of ventricular arrythmia, and a shortened life expectancy.It is the most common cause of hospitalization in patients over the age of 65!The incidence of CHF is only increasing, particularly with the influx of baby boomers over the next few years.Causes of Heart FailureMyocardial Infarction/Ischemic Heart Disease &#8594; most common cause we see.Cardiomyopathy/myocarditis &#8594; a cardiomyopathy is any cause of reduced heart function not due to the coronary arteries.Valvular Heart Disease &#8594; where a valvular lesion isn&#8217;t detected until it causes severe problems.Hypertension &#8594; can increase strain on the heart, due to increased preload and afterload.1. Myocardial Infarction/Ischemic Heart DiseaseRecall from ITM that necrotic tissue that forms from an MI is replaced with collagenized scar tissue that is non-functional.The main reason why this can cause heart failure is because of a loss of functional myocardium.There may also be an element of valvular disruption, if the infarction kills any tissue involving a valve.For instance, damage to the papillary muscles associated with the mitral valve.With chronic ischemia, cardiac tissue may hibernate &#8594; it won&#8217;t be dead, but it won&#8217;t be active.In these cases, oftentimes this tissue can be salvageable with increased perfusion!In the western world, MI/Ischemia is the most common cause of CHF!2. Dilated Cardiomyopathy/MyocarditisIn dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle looks normal (even under the microscopy sometimes), but the heart is very baggy.The muscle itself doesn&#8217;t work wellThere are probably a lot of underlying genetic reasons why this can occur.Some possible causes include:1. Idiopathic CardiomyopathyThe usual presentation of idiopathic cardiomyopathy is in the clinic is a young patient that complains of a cough.Treated as if it was bronchitis for a few months, but the cough doesn&#8217;t go away! The patient becomes progressively shorter of breath.Patient is then usually put on bronchodilators, antibiotics, but keeps getting worse.Develops dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.It&#8217;s usually only at this point that the diagnosis of heart failure is made!No signs of coronary disease, but he has a baggy ventricle on the echo.This usually comes with a strong family history &#8594; probably genetic.2. Inflammatory CardiomyopathyOne example is Granulomatous myocarditis due to sarcoidosis.You can see acute inflammation and granulomas upon microscopic examination.Typically associated with an antecedent viral infection.Chronic inflammation can lead to fibrosis and loss of function of cardiac function.3. Peripartum CardiomyopathyThis is where you see the onset of heart failure during late pregnancy or early post-partum.4. Metabolic CardiomyopathyLook for hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, because both can lead to reduced heart function.Both are also easily treatable, so you should always look at this!5. HemochromatosisIron overload can lead to to reduced heart function.Recall that hemochromatosis is an inability to regulate absorption of iron from the duodenum and proximal jejunum.6. MedicationsAnthracyclines like doxorubicin (adriamycin) are cardiotoxic. (From Blood!)Similarly, trastuzamab (herceptin), which is used for breast cancers, also has a cardiotoxic effect.Cobalt is also cardiotoxic! In the past, people put cobalt in the beer to improve foaming. This wasn&#8217;t a good idea.7. Excess CatecholaminesRecall that chronically high sympathetic tone can be cardiotoxic!So if we have excess catecholamines (perhaps due to chronic stress), there can be cardiac consequences.8. Tachycardia InducedThis is because tachycardia stresses the heart for a long period of time.Again, this can lead to failure if demand exceeds supply of oxygen for too long.In the above ECG, the P-wave in I, II, and III are inverted!This suggests that the atrial impulse is occurring somewhere other than the SA node.This ectopic pacemaker is what&#8217;s driving the heart and causing the tachycardia in this case.Catheter ablation of the ectopic foci was used to return this patient to his original pace.3. Valvular Heart DiseaseMitral and aortic regurgitation are the most common ones, as they can lead to chronic volume overload.If you repair/replace the regurgitant valve too late, it can cause permanent damage.4. HypertensionChronic pressure overload increases afterload, causing LV concentric hypertrophy.This increases myocardial oxygen demand, and if the heart is still overwhelmed, can lead to subsequent eccentric hypertrophy as the heart fails to maintain contractility.This can eventually lead to LV systolic failure.Symptoms of Heart FailureSymptoms of heart failure can be easily remembered from the underlying physiology.In left sided heart failure, reduced forward flow due to a reduced EF can cause fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, lightheadedness, and hypotension.Backflow to the lungs can cause pulmonary edema, shortness of breath, and orthopnea/PND.In right sided heart failure, this backflow goes to the LA &#8594; venous system!This causes an elevated JVP, hepatic congestion, and peripheral edema.Note that the most common cause of right heart failure is actually left heart failure!A good summary of this is below:Evaluating the Severity of Heart FailureNYHA Classification of Heart FailureNYHA = New York Heart AssociationThis is a classification of symptoms of heart failure!There are 4 classes in the NYHA classification:Class I &#8594; no symptoms, can perform ordinary activities without any limitations. They still have LV dysfunction, they&#8217;re just not symptomatic yet.Class II &#8594; somewhat limited in the ability to exercise or do other strenuous activities, but no symptoms at rest!Class III &#8594; noticeably limited in the ability to exercise or do other strenuous activities. Only comfortable at rest.Class IV &#8594; unable to do any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms at rest.NYHA ClassificationClass I = no symptomsClass II = slightly limited with exercise, no symptoms at rest.Class III = noticeably limited with exercise, only comfortable at restClass IV = symptoms at restTests for Congestive Heart FailureHistory &amp; Physical ExaminationInitial ExaminationsChest radiograph &#8594; look for heart size, cardiac silhouette, pulmonary findings.Electrocardiogram &#8594; assess cardiac function, arrythmias, hypertrophy.B-type Natriuretic Peptide &#8594; look for atrial stretch (recall ANP)Ferritin &#8594; check for iron overload, possible hemochromatosis.TSH &#8594; check for hyper/hypothyroidism.CK &#8594; creatine kinase is a muscle enzyme. So patients with neuromuscular disease will have an elevated CK.Assessment of Ventricular Function - EchocardiogramAdditional InvestigationsRadionucleotide Imaging &#8594; eg. perfusion assays (SPECT) to look at myocardial oxygen supply.Cardiac cathetherization &#8594; to look at pressures.Stress tests &#8594; to look for ischemic changes with exercise.The Chest X-RayCan be used to assess heart size via the cardiac silhouette.Can also look for pulmonary edema and vascularization of the lung.If the width of the heart is greater than 1/2 the width of the chest, then it suggests heart enlargement! Great rule of thumb.The ElectrocardiogramQ-waves suggestive of a past MI.Above we see Q-waves across the anterior wall.LV hypertrophy with an elevated R wave in the anterior chest leads.The EchocardiogramAs we&#8217;ve seen before, we can do a lot with an echo.Morphology, flow, the presence/absence of valvular lesions, etc.You can also easily see which chambers are dilated/hypertrophic.Assessing Cardiac FunctionThe Ejection Fraction is critical!Since EF = (EDV - ESV)/EDV, but volumes are difficult to obtain clinically, we usually use clinical surrogates.Sometimes, we can use more complex tests like radionucleotide angiography, to obtain better measures of volumes, and get a better assessment of the ejection fraction.The LVEF is a critical predictor for a patient&#8217;s prognosis, as seen to the right.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/02/10/heart-failure-1.html"},

It&#8217;s actually because of rupture of a plaque which travels somewhere else!This is very different from chronic stenosis such as when we have anginaPlaques with a thin fibrous cap with a high degree of inflammation are more vulnerable to rupture.The trigger to induce rupture may be hemodynamic stress (which cases shear stress on the plaque), or it can be immune/inflammatory mediated.The plaques prior to rupture need not be flow limiting! Hence, they may not be discoverable with a stress test.However, not all MIs are due to plaque rupture! LOOK THIS SHIT UP LATER YOU SLEEPY FATTIE! Infrequent Causes of MIThe following causes are much less common than the classical pathophysiology of a plaque rupture. - Fixed and severe coronary narrowings subjected to sudden &#8595; supply or &#8593; demand. - eg. Severe hypotension from hemorrhage with tachycardia.Primary coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal&#8217;s &#8212; rare)Anomalous Coronary Arteries (in a young person &#8212; very rare!)Embolus: A clot in the LV or LA or endocarditis.Cocaine use: Induces spasm and thrombosis &#8212; Suspect in the appropriate setting/population.STABLE ANGINA IS NOT PART OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE!?Non ST Segment Elevation (NSTEMI)Non ST Segment Elevation (NSTEMI) is usually either ST Depression or T Inversion.Non-occlusive thrombus.Usually older compared to the ST eleveation population.Few develop Q wavesThe early mortality is less than with the Q wave populationHowever, the 6 month mortality is equivalent.NSTEMI &#8212; Common MechanismNSTEMI &#8212; Less Frequent MechanismDifferential DiagnosisAortic dissectionChest wall painEsophageal reflux/gastritisPulmonary embolismPneumoniaPericarditisPneumothoraxMyocarditisTakotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress-induced apical ballooning) - Stress induced cardiomyopathy &#8212; broken heart syndromeBiomarkers for MIUsed to by called cardiac enzymes, but with the advent of troponin, which isn&#8217;t an enzyme, we now just call them cardiac biomarkers.TroponinFibrinolysis (thrombolytic) therapyIntravenous agents that aim to dissolve fibrin fibres.Complete restoration of flow in 50-55% of cases.Bleeding can occur with a 1% risk of stroke!

	{"title": "Coronary Circulation", "text": "Coronary AnatomyThere are two main coronary arteries, the left coronary artery and the right coronary artery. These break into branches, as we saw in our heart anatomy lab. The branching can be very complex, and can have different relative flow.Right vs. Left DominanceRecall from our anatomy lab that normally, the posterior interventricular branch of the right coronary artery travels across the posterior interventricular sulcus and the left anterior descending (the 'anterior interventricular artery') travels across the anterior interventricular sulcus.Typically we are right dominant with respect to coronary circulation - around 85% of the population. Dominance determines how a patient will respond to occlusion!The sides of our coronary circulation rejoin at the back of the heart.Each patient has their posterior descending artery (PDA) supplied by either the left or the right coronary artery. This is their &#8216;dominant&#8217; side.Epicardial vs. Endocardial FlowBlood generally doesn&#8217;t flow too well through the myocardial plexuses, so the endocardial flow is generally at greater risk than the epicardial flow. Systolic vs. Diastolic FlowRecall that supply of the coronary arteries occurs during ventricular diastole.Consequently, coronary artery blood flow is maximal at diastole. Hence we try to slow a patient&#8217;s heart rate if they have reduced coronary flow, to extend length in diastole.The coronary veins then return back into the right atrium, as we saw in our heart anatomy lab.Blockage of the Coronary ArteriesIf secondary to acute thrombosisThrombolysisIf secondary to vasospasmVasodilatorsIn the case of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), or chronic disease with associated symptoms (angina)Balloon angioplasty with a stentOr if the anatomy doesn&#8217;t allow for a balloon angioplasty, we could use a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).CABG isn&#8217;t open heart surgery! It&#8217;s open chest surgery! Often mis-labeled!1. Stent InsertionStent Insertion involves insertion of a balloon catheter into the stenotic region, which can then be inflated to open up the narrowed region.A stent can then be placed in the region, to keep it open after the operation.Balloon angioplasty is much less invasive, but sometimes, anatomical restrictions do not allow us to do it!2. The Coronary Bypass Graft (CABG)A CABG involves taking a radial artery (that isn&#8217;t flow dominant) or a mammary artery from the chest wall, and sewing it directly onto the surface of the heart to bypass a blockage.Typically multiple bypasses are done, since if there&#8217;s one blockage, there&#8217;s probably more!The idea of treatment is to balance oxygen demand and supply. If there is reduced coronary flow, we can either improve supply or decrease demand!What affects Oxygen Demand?Heart RateContractility (dP/dt)Wall Tension (T) aka Afterload: Wall tension is directly proportional to pressure and radius.What affects Oxygen Supply?Flow to tissue (myocardium): Recall the difference between epicardial and endocardial flow!Hemoglobin Concentration in the BloodOxygen Saturation (SpO2 or SaO2): This is actually far more important than pO2 &#8212; the partial pressure of Oxygen.Remember the formula for oxygen delivery was:Oxygen Delivery = (Flow)L/min &#215; ((Hbg/L &#215; SaO2 &#215; 1.34) + 0.03 &#215; paO2)Where SaO2 is the Percent Oxygen Saturation, and paO2 is the Partial Pressure of O2Typically we aim for 92% Oxygen Saturation!That way we reach the plateau of the sigmoidal curve, and we are less sensitive to variation with small changes in SaO2.Coronary StealImagine a coronary artery with stenosis (narrowing)It is already maximally vasodilated under normal conditions in an attempt to maintain flow.The territory is supplies may even rely on collateral circulation to maintain a tenuous blood supply.Now imagine that we observe that there is coronary ischemia &#8212; so we give a vasodilator like nitroglycerin that vasodilates all coronariesNow there is vasodilation across the entire coronary circulation, reducing pressure away from the stenotic area.The diseased vessel and collaterals are already maximallly dilated, and can&#8217;t dilate any further.Flow will then move in the path of least resistance, and actually flow out of the diseased area.This is what is termed coronary steal!We can&#8217;t actually observe this happening! But when we prescribe vasodilators and we see flow to the ischemic area drop, this is what we presume happens.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/02/04/coronary-circulation.html"},

Muscarinic ReceptorsOne example is Bethanechol chloride (Duvoid)muscarinic agonistacts against the parasympathetic nervous system, as well as sweat glands in the sympathetic.Urinary bladder stimulantAs a consequence, what side effects would you expect?Increased sweating &#8594; because of sympathetic innervation of the sweat glands by muscarinic receptors.In the lungs, the parasympathetic response would be bronchoconstriction.Fall in the heart rate.Also, effects on SLUDGE (salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal emesis).As a result, Duvoid is contraindicated in those with bradycardia.A mushroom called Aminida muscaria is also a muscarinic agonist.Hence, mushroom poisoning with this gives you all the same effects.They&#8217;re also part of class of drugs known as &#8216;Magic Mushrooms&#8217; due to CNS effects in the brain!2. Nicotinic ReceptorsThe obvious nicotinic receptor agonist is nicotine.Recall that nicotinic receptors are in the ganglia, NMJs, and CNS.Recall that the nicotinic receptors in the ganglia and CNS are different from those at the neuromuscular junctions, and can be targeted differently.As a medication, nicotine itself mostly affects the CNS and ganglia, and not so much the neuromuscular junctions (unless in toxic doses).Initially, nicotine will stimulate these receptors to increase sympathetic tone (recall that the ganglia for both the SNS and PSNS are have cholinergic nerves with nicotinic receptors).It will also stimulate the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal.As we have more toxic doses, the effect on the parasympathetic ganglia will begin to dominate, so we&#8217;ll see some salivation, diarrhea, etc.After extremely high ingestion, we can see muscle paralysis by acting on the NMJs and causing a blockage of transmission.Consequently, nicotine has a very dose-dependent effect.Indirect Acting DrugsThe indirect cholinomimetic drugs inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AchE).Hence they&#8217;re also known as anticholinesterases.They inhibits Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) by preventing Ach binding.Because Ach is also a neurotransmitter, if the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier, it can also cause CNS effects.Since anticholinesterases result in the accumulation of Ach in the synapse, there will be stimulation of both the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.As a result, we have very messy pharmacological efects.Muscarinic Response (parasympathetic) &#8594; SLUDGENicotinic Response &#8594; activation of the NMJ, and autonomic effects because of effects on the ganglia.CNS Effects, if we have crossing of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). This could lead to psychosis and seizures in toxic doses.Consequently, when we use these drugs clinically, we have to be very careful with the dosage.1. Reversible AnticholinesterasesSimple alcoholsCarbamates.Neostigmine is one good example we saw in ITM.2. Irreversible AnticholinesterasesOrganophosphatesAn example of this would be the Sarin nerve gas.Anticholinesterase TherapyGlaucoma &#8594; we use the PSNS to cause miosis (pupil constriction), to improve flow, and reduce pressure.Myasthenia GravisRecall that Myasthenia Gravis is a Type II Hypersensitivity reaction resulting in antibodies against the Acetylcholine receptors.Can present with ptosis &#8594; dropping of the eyelid.Causes impaired muscle contraction, and weakness.We use anticholinesterases to compensatorily increase Ach levels to improve muscle function.Typical anticholinesterases for this don&#8217;t cross the BBB, obviously.Treatment of Dementia/Cognitive ImpairmentObviously here we aim for the drug to cross the BBB, where it has its function.Not useful with mild cognitive impairment, no improvement in function but lots of side effects!Side effects include muscarinic effects (SLUDGE)There are also nicotinic effects &#8594; sympathetic enervation causing BP and HR changesCholinoceptor Blocking DrugsMuscarinic Receptor AntagonistsAtropos is the third of the 'Three Fates', daughters of Zeus. Atropos cuts the thread of life! A pretty unfortunate name.One example is AtropineAtropine is used to increase heart rate, by blocking vagal enervation of the heart.This makes sense, since it &#8595;PSNS, it should be similar to &#8593;SNS!It&#8217;s toxic in large doses.Note that Atropine does not induce muscle weakness. It only acts on the muscarinic receptors, so it doesn&#8217;t affect the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junctions.It will cause tachycardia, dry mouth, etc. (anti-PSNS effects).Atropine would also be used to treat muscarinic toxicity (eg. because someone ate a magic mushroom).It would also be used to treat acetylcholinesterase toxicity to block the muscarinic effect (we don&#8217;t have anything that can specifically block the nicotinic ganglionic effect as of yet).Anticholinergic Toxidrome (Antimuscarinic Toxidrome)This describes the set of side-effects we have from muscarinic antagonism:Hot as a hare &#8594; people are no longer able to sweat, can&#8217;t thermoregulate.Dry as a bone &#8594; also because they can&#8217;t sweat anymore. Also, since we block salivation (the S in SLUDGE), we have a dry mouth.Red as a beet &#8594; flushing due to systemic vasodilation. (recall that the SNS causes systemic vasoconstriction and skeletal muscle vasodilation)Blind as a bat &#8594; pupil dilation affects the reflex of accomodation.Mad as a hatter &#8594; if the muscarinic antagonist passes the BBB, which atropine does, it can cause CNS effects.Surprisingly, a lot of medications we have nowadays have anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects.Some examples include Gravol and Benadryl (diphenhydramine).These drugs can predispose elderly patients to delirium!For instance, Tolterodine (Detrol), which is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist, is used for overactive bladder, by decreasing vagal stimulation of the bladder.What side effects would you expect by inhibiting the PSNS?Dry mouth, constipation, blurry vision (blind as a bat), flushing, etc.Because of this, there&#8217;s a risk of causing a prescribing cascade, especially since muscarinic antagonists have such diverse side-effects.Another muscarinic receptor antagonist is Ipratropium Bromide &#8594; used as a bronchodilator.Muscarinic Receptor AntagonistsAtropine.Tolterodine &#8594; used for an overactive bladder.Ipratropium Bromide &#8594; used as a bronchodilator.Nicotinic Receptor AntagonistsThese are all neuromuscular blockers.We don&#8217;t use drugs that block ganglionic function anymore because they had too many side-effects, affecting both the SNS and PSNS. (Since all the ganglia are cholinergic, and feed to neurons with nicotinic receptors).Classes of nicotinic receptor antagonists include:DepolarizingNon-depolarizing1. Depolarizing Neuromuscular BlockersSuccinylcholine &#8594; blocks depolarization, causing muscle paralysis.Structurally, succinylcholine looks like two Ach molecules stuck together.This lets them bind specifically to the NMJ cholinergic receptors, but because they&#8217;re structurally different, they aren&#8217;t rapidly broken down by acetylcholinesterases.This depolarizes the muscle, causing muscle fasciculations.But because it isn&#8217;t broken down rapidly, the muscles are transiently paralyzed.This gives you a brief period of muscular paralysis (around 5 minutes).Clinically, this is used to help intubate a patient.2. Non-depolarizing Neuromuscular BlockersThese are competitive antagonists at the neuromuscular junction.The archetypical example of this is curare, although it&#8217;s not used medically anymore.They bind to nicotinic receptors, but don&#8217;t cause depolarization (compared to Succinylcholine).This results in muscle paralysis as well, but it has a slower onset and a longer duration of effect.How do we reverse this effect?If we have a drug that is blocking neuromuscular conduction via competitive antagonism, we can simply increase the levels of Acetylcholine.This can be done with an anticholinesterase.This is usually combined with atropine to block the muscarinic effects of the anticholinesterase. (recall that because it increases Ach everywhere, it stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic innervation)This is done when we wake someone up from anesthesia!Case StudyConsider this Sick Triceratops (ahaha!). Why was he sick?His symptoms included:Dilated pupils.Dry tongue.Absent bowel sounds.Urinary retention.Not sweating.Confused.ChoicesAcetylcholinesterase inhibitor.Sympathomimetic agent.Antocholinergic (antimuscarinic) agent.Nicotinic receptor blocker.Nicotine toxicity.These are the effects you would see when you block muscarinic innervation.Sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to differentiate between a sympathomimetic agent and an antimuscarinic agent &#8594; both increase the SNS:PSNS ratio, except at the sweat glands.Hence, the key to differentiating between these is the sweating. With a sympathomimetic agent, you will have sweating, but with the antimuscarinic one, you won&#8217;t!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/31/cholinergic-pharmacology-2.html"},

Her blood pressure is 160/100, with a heart rate of 80 per minute.End Organ Disease due to HypertensionBrain vascular dementiaEyes &#8212; hypertensive retinopathiesHeart failureKidney proteinuriaCase QuestionsIs there any special issue about how her blood pressure should be measured?Ignore first reading, average second and third.Bowel and bladder should be emptied.Avoid smoking, eating, drinking, immediately before measuring the BP.Continue taking blood pressures over successive visits to ensure that this isn&#8217;t an aberrant reading.To diagnose hypertension, we use &#62; 140-180 systolic with symptoms of end-organ disease.What treatment, if any, should she be given?Adjusting diet to avoid high-salt, high-cholesterol foods.Exercise at least 30 minutes, 3-4 times a week.BMI target is 19-25. Aim for 5% weight loss in 3 months as a preliminary goal.Anti-hypertension medications should be used as a last resort &#8212; should expect a 5-10 mmHg drop in BP.The ABCD&#8217;s of Anti-hypertension medications:Ace inhibitorsBeta-blockersCalcium-channel blockersDiureticsCase 2Case Summary:A 58-year-old man with Type II diabetes presents for annual followup. His weight is down 5 pounds from last year; his diabetes is well controlled with diet and exercise (Hb A1C 0.055); he does not smoke, and has been following a healthy diet, with no added salt and avoidance of salty foods. His fasting lipids are normal, with a Total Cholesterol of 4.7, Triglycerides 1.8, HDL 1.2.

	{"title": "Vascular Small Group Session", "text": "Case 1Case Summary:Fifty year old male presents with the following:Abdominal pain - ultrasound shows 6 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)Left carotid bruitECG: Moderate ischemic heart diseaseAlways a cost-benefit analysis &#8212; only treat the AAA when the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of surgery!Carotid bruit- Atherosclerotic plaque affects flow through the carotid, introducing turbulence. But it does not mean that it&#8217;s an emergent situation! May not be symptomatic. Can be common in the elderly.Moderate Ischemic heart disease as well.In summary, suggests urgent attention.How do you repair an aneurysm?Open repair: The older, more invasive method.Fairly invasive, involves clamping, which can impede blood flow.Blood thinners are also required (Heparin), in order to avoid thrombus formation with static blood flow introduced by clamping.We attempt to clamp underneath the renal vessel to avoid renal ischemia &#8212; the kidneys do not handle ischemia for very long!Endovascular: Sneak a stent graft up a femoral vessel, and pop out the stent to close out the aneurysm.Very quick recovery time, non invasive. However, many patients may not have appropriate anatomy for it!No long term analysis on graft viability.Case QuestionsWhat are the indications for AAA repair?5 cm for females, 5.5 cm for males.When it exceeds that, we consider repair.What are the preoperative considerations with respect to risk?The treatment approach (open vs endovascular) depends on the patient!70 person with lots of comorbidities &#8212; would probably use an endovascular approach, since the patient may not survive the surgery.50 year old that is healthy, may use an open approach, since we don&#8217;t know the long term viability of the endovascular approach.Also, the stent grafts are expensive ($40,000)! Custom-grafts are around ($75,000)!!Determining the treatment path depends on assessment of patient health.What investigations are appropriate for follow up and pre-operative imaging?CT Scan pre-op.We also perform CT Scans post-op. For an open repair, the next CT is 1 year after. For an endovascular repair, we also perform a CT after one month to ensure the graft hasn&#8217;t moved.We don&#8217;t really know when to stop CT imaging &#8212; we generally keep doing it until the patient wants to stop!We look to ensure the aneurysm sac isn&#8217;t getting bigger &#8212; it shouldn&#8217;t since we just occluded it!Also look for appropriate perfusion, especially to the renal area.What are the indications for open and endovascular AAA repair and how are these procedures performed?Addressed in previous notes.Depends on the health of the patient.Open repair involves opening the abdominal cavity, while the endovascular repair involves sneaking a stent graft up a femoral artery.Case 2Case Summary:Eighty year old male presents with the following:Gangrene left toe.No pulses in the left leg, but good pulses in the right leg.Insulin dependent diabetes.MI three years ago.Two types of gangrene: wet gangrene and dry gangreneMany patients have dry gangrene because of poor circulation.Wet gangrene is bad &#8212; it suggests an active infection!Statins should be used even if there isn&#8217;t hypercholesterolemia with valvular heart disease. It causes plaque stabiliization.ASA should also be given.Tests used to Assess Lower Extremity Ischemia.ABI - Ankle Brachial Indices. Ratio between BP in arm and BP in various parts of the leg.Non-invasive Doppler: Can be used to visually assess blood flow in the lower extremities.Signs of Acute Limb IschemiaIf the patient has trouble moving the legPaleness and numbness of the leg.Affected pulses: Popliteal, femoral, etc.Calf tenderness due to lack of perfusion.Case QuestionsHow do we classify limb ischemia and how does chronic limb ischemia present?What are atherosclerotic risk factors associated with peripheral vascular disease?Smoking is a big one!Diabetes is another big risk factor.What are the important aspects of a history and physical to help differentiate between presentations of limb ischemia?Acute: Act fast, go directly to the OR. Sudden onset of pain. Can have mortality as high as 25% immediately after the procedure. Sudden blood flow back to the leg can cause swelling, and a lot of pain, and can crush the blood supply again &#8594; Compartment Syndome. We perform lateral fasciotomies to relieve pressure.Chronic: Can take your time, typically counsel patients on smoking. Typically present with gradual progression in pain.How is chronic lower extremity ischemia managed and what are long term outcomes?Patients should walk through the pain to help form blood vessels.Patients may progress to rest pain &#8212; pain in the feet even when they&#8217;re resting.Feet not the calf since the circulation is poorer more distally.Rest pain is taken more seriously &#8211; immediate CT and treatment approach.Long term outcomes: 50% will stay the same, 25% will get worse, %25 will get better.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/31/vascular-small-group.html"},

	{"title": "Mediastinum Anatomy Lab", "text": "The mediastinum occupies the central part of the thoracic cavity, between the two pleural cavities. The lateral surface of its contents (adjacent to the lungs) are covered by mediastinal pleura. For descriptive purposes, the mediastinum is split into 4 parts:The superior mediastinum &#8212; the area between a line joining the sternal angle to the T4-T5 intervertebral disc, inferiorly; and the oblique plane of the first rib, superiorly. Above the first rib, the superior mediastinum is continuous with the root of the neck. Basically, the area above the middle mediastinumThe middle mediastinum &#8212; Consists of the pericardium and its related structures. It goes from the sternal angle to the diaphragm.The anterior mediastinum &#8212; A small area anterior to the pericardium where the sternal reflections of the right and left parietal pleura don&#8217;t meet in the midline. Basically, a gap in the front between the two lungs. The thymus and connective tissue lie there.The posterior mediastinum &#8212; posterior to the middle mediastinum and continuing down behind the dome of the diaphragm to the T12 vertebral level. 2-4 are often joined together as the inferior mediastinumContents of the Superior MediastinumArteries - the arch of the aorta and its branches, and the pulmonary arteries.Veins - The left and right brachiocephalic, and the superior vena cava.Nerves - The left and right vagus, left and right phrenic, and the left recurrent laryngeal.Contents of the Posterior MediastinumArteries - the descending (thoracic) aorta, and branches.Veins - The azygos and hemiazygos veins.Nerves - The vagus and its branches.The oesophagus and the thoracic duct are in both the superior and posterior mediastinum.ArteriesThe AortaThe ascending aorta emerges from the pericardium, and enters the superior mediastinum, where it becomes the arch of the aorta.The top of this arch reaches the mid-manubrial level, while the bottom is at the level of the sternal angleThe ascending aorta, arch of the aorta, and descending aorta each have branches:1. Branches of the Ascending AortaThe left coronary arteryThe right coronary artery2. Branches of the Arch of the AortaThe brachiocephalic trunk: arises from the beginning of the arch. It then divides into the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery.The left common carotid artery: arises from the highest part of the arch behind the manubrium and enters the neck behind the left sternoclavicular joint.The left subclavian artery: emerges about 1/2 an inch distal to the left common carotid artery.SummaryThe branches of the arch of the aorta are as follows, proximally to distally:The brachiocephalic trunk, which splits into the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid arteryThe left common carotid arteryThe left subclavian artery.3. Branches of the Descending AortaThe descending aorta has small branches to adjunct structures. These branches include the:Bronchial branchPosterior intercostalsOesophagealPhrenic BranchPericardial BranchPulmonary ArteriesThe pulmonary trunk is located within the middle mediastinum. Around the level of the sternal angle is splits into the left pulmonary artery and the right pulmonary artery, which lack a pericardial coveringThe ductus arteriorus is a fetal artery that served to shunt blood from the left pulmonary artery to the systemic circulation, bypassing the lungs. This is because the fetal lungs are non-functional &mdash; the fetus gets oxygenated blood from the parent.The inferior surface of the arch of the aorta (right underneath the arch) is joined to the left pulmonary artery by a fibrous ligamenum arteriosum, which is a remnant of the ductus arteriosus.VeinsBrachiocephalic VeinsThe left and right brachiocephalic veins originate in the neck, behind the sternal end of the clavicles, by the union of the internal jugular vein with the subclavian vein on each side.The union of the two brachiocephalic veins forms the vena cava.Superior Vena CavaThe superior vena cava descends through the superior mediastinum passing anterior to the root of the right lung, just to the right of the manubrium.The azygos vein drains into the posterior side of the SVC before it enters the pericardial sac.Azygos and Hemiazygos VeinsThese are located in the posterior mediastinumThe azygos vein origiates from the veins draining the posterior abdominal wall on the right sideThere are usually two hemiazygos veins draining the left intercostal spaces, an upper (or accessory vein), and a lower one.They hide behind the thoracic aorta, and run up (the lower hemiazygos) and run down (the upper hemiazygos) the vertebral column.NervesVagusThe right vagus nerve leaves the neck by crossing anterior to the subclavian artery.It enters the superior mediastinum between the brachiocephalic artery and vein, beside the trachea.It then goes behind the root of the lung where it contributes to plexuses, namely the pulmonary plexus and the cardiac plexus.It then enters the posterior mediastinum along the back surface of the esophagus.

	{"title": "Cholinergic Pharmacology I", "text": "Organization of the Central Nervous SystemTo the right is a review of the organization of the nervous system.We have both afferent and efferent nerves.The afferent nerves take signals from the periphery and brings it to the CNS.The efferent nerves take the CNS response and brings it to the periphery.The efferent component is split into the somatic system and the autonomic system.We control the somatic system.We have no control over the autonomic system.The autonomic system is then split into 3 other systems:Sympathetic &#8594; &#8216;Fight or flight&#8217;.Classified as thoracolumbar because the corresponding nerves come out at the thoracic and lumbar area.We have nerves that come out of the spinal cord and into ganglia, that are located paravertabrally (along the vertebra).There&#8217;s also a lot of cross-talk between these ganglia, causing simultaneous responses in multiple organ systems.The post-ganglionic fibres then enter all of our different organ systems.The adrenal medulla is similar to a ganglia itself, so when it releases epinephrine and norephinephrine, this can act on other ganglia.Parasympathetic &#8594; &#8216;Rest and Digest&#8217;Enteric &#8594; probably the biggest and most complex of the 3.It has more nerves than the entire spinal cord.It&#8217;s involved with digestion, peristalsis of the gut.Is gives you local control over these functions. For instance, if you have a spinal cord injury, typically nerves below the injury fail to communicate.But because we have local control over digestion via the enteric system, we can still process food!The Sympathetic Nervous SystemAs we saw before, the sympathetic nervous system has adrenergic receptors. These are split into 3 categories:Alpha ReceptorsAlpha 1 &#8594; post-synaptic. vascular smooth muscle vasoconstriction.Alpha 2 &#8594; pre-synaptic. provide negative feedback by inhibiting norepinephrine release.Beta ReceptorsBeta 1 - cardioselective, &#8593;HR, &#8593;contractility, &#8593;conduction.Beta 2 - skeletal smooth muscle vasodilation &amp; bronchodilationBeta 3 - lipolysis. No drugs target them.Dopamine ReceptorsSummary of Alpha Adrenergic ReceptorsAlpha 1 receptors are post-synaptic and cause vascular smooth muscle vasoconstriction.Alpha 2 receptors are pre-synaptic and inhibit norepinephrine release to act as negative feedback.Summary of Beta Adrenergic ReceptorsBeta 1 receptors are cardioselective, and increase HR, contractility, and conductionBeta 2 receptors cause smooth muscle vasodilation and bronchodilationBeta 3 receptors possibly cause lipolysis.Adrenergic Receptor DownregulationAdrenergic receptors are GPCRs, and they rely on downstream secondary messengers.For adreneric receptors, this secondary messenger is cAMP.When there&#8217;s is chronic excessive stimulation of the receptors, this actually causes receptor downregulation, via intracellularization and digestion.This means that over time, we have an attenuated effect.One example of this is the use of nasal sprays.Continual stimulation of &#945;-adrenergic receptors to cause nasal vasoconstriction can reduce sensitivity. This will eventually cause rebound nasal congestion.The opposite can occur as well &#8594; with continual use of beta-blockers, we actually increase the number of expressed receptors.So when we stop the beta-blocker abruptly, we may have a rebound tachycardia and hypertension due to increased sensitivity to adrenergic agonists.Alpha 1 AgonistsOne example is phenylephrine.IV norepinephrine has a strong &#945;-1 effect &#8594; vasoconstriction.Beta 2 AgonistsExamples include Salbutamol/albuterol (Ventolin).The &#946;-2 effect is used here for bronchodilation in people with reactive airway disease (like asthma).These are usually inhaled, because they still have some beta-1 effect &#8594; an IV injection could cause tachycardia and hypertension.The Unopposed Alpha EffectThis occurs when you use a beta-blocker in a patient with very high adrenergic tone &#8594; high alpha and beta-stimulation.When you add the beta-blocker, we block the &#946;-2 vasodilatory effect, which somewhat modulates the &#945;-1 vasoconstion effect. (Although &#946;-2 primarily vasodilates the skeletal muscle, it also has a systemic vasodilation effect)As a result, the &#945;-effect is unapposed, and we see paradoxical hypertension/vasoconstrictionThis can be seen in a few clinical situations:Pheochromocytoma &#8594; A pretty rare tumour that produces catecholamines.These patients will have huge circulating levels of N-Epi.When we try to treat the patient&#8217;s tachycardia and hypertension with a beta-blocker with no alpha activity, it would exacerbate the symptoms!Instead, we treat these patients with an &#945;-blocker first, and then carefully titrate the &#946;-blocker dose.Cocaine &#8594; cocaine has a sympathomimetic effect, so it also creates an adrenergic &#8216;storm&#8217;, so to speak.As a result, patients on cocaine also have high alpha and beta stimulation.This can also result in the unapposed alpha effect.QuestionIf I had a patient who was vasodilated (for example with septic shock) what type of drug would I choose to help improve blood pressure?alpha agonistalpha blockerbeta agonistbeta blockerHere, you would want systemic vasoconstriction, so you would use an alpha-agonist.The archetypical alpha-agonist would be norepinephrine in this case.It&#8217;s a very potent vasoconstrictor, so you have to be careful when you give it IV, because if they end up getting into tissue, they can actually cause ischemia due to extrema vasoconstriction.QuestionIf I had a patient with cardiogenic shock - a very low cardiac output - what drug would increase the contractility of the heart?alpha agonistalpha blockerbeta agonistbeta blockerHere, you would want to use a beta-agonist with beta-1 activity.We generally don&#8217;t use these drugs chronically, because chronic SNS can be cardiotoxic, as has been discussed ad nauseum.QuestionA patient with asthma develops bronchospasm and wheezing. Which type of medication would be most likely to cause this?alpha agonistalpha blockerbeta agonistbeta blockerA beta-blocker, that blocks the beta-2 bronchodilatory function.Because of this, we saw that beta-blockers were contraindicated in patients with reactive airway diseases!The Parasympathetic Nervous SystemThe parasympathetic nervous system is our rest and digest system. It generally oppposes the sympathetic nervous system.Anatomically, it is considered cranial &amp; sacral, versus thoracolumbar for the sympathetic nervous system.Cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X are parasympathetic (The oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus).III is involved with parasympathetic pupil constriction.VII is involved with salivation and lacrimation.IX is involved with the parotid glands &#8594; salivation.X is the vagus &#8594; involved with basically everything!The sacral component is involved with:the large bowelthe bladder &#8594; bladder contraction.the genitals &#8594; eg. erection in men.the sphincters &#8594; eg. opening up the rectal and urethral sphincters.Enervation of the SNS &amp; PSNSSNS = thoracic + lumbarPSNS = cranial + sacralThe SLUDGE acronym is a good way to remember the more&#8230; &#8216;productive&#8217; PSNS effects:S &#8594; salivation.L &#8594; lacrimation.U &#8594; urination.D &#8594; defecation.GE &#8594; gastrointestinal emesis. (lots of peristalsis &#8594; vomiting)Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic ConductionThe PSNS and SNS are classified anatomically (cranial + sacral vs thoracolumbar).The nerves in each are classified by neurotransmitters.In the SNS, we have postganglionic adrenergic nerves, that use Norepinephrine, except for a few exceptions, such as sweat glands.In the PSNS, we have postganglionic cholinergic nerves, that use Acetylcholine.Adrenergic Receptors are split into alpha, beta, and dopamine.Cholinergic Receptors are split into muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.Cholinergic neurons are involved in the parasympathetic system for cardiac &amp; smooth muscle, and in all of the ganglia, for both the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia &#8594; sort of confusing!They&#8217;re also involved in the presynaptic connections to all our skeletal muscles.Comparing the SNS vs the PSNSThe SNS is thoracolumbar and has postganglionic adrenergic nerves that use norepinephrine. (except for sweat gland innervation)The PSNS is cranial + sacral and has postgangionic cholinergic nerves that use acetylcholine.Adrenergic receptors are classified as alpha, beta, and dopamine.Cholinergic receptors are classified as muscarinic and nicotinicCholinergic NervesLocated in all motor neurons innervating skeletal muscleLocated in all preganglionic neurons &#8594; PSNS, SNS, &amp; adrenal medulla.All postganglionic parasympathetic neurons.Some postganglionic sympathetic neurons (sweat glands).Central cholinergic neurons (CNS)The above figure compares the innervation of the SNS and PSNS.Cholinergic TransmissionFiring an action potential with Acetylcholine requires many steps:Synthesis of acetylcholineStorage of acetylcholineReleaseCholinergic receptor activationInactivation by acetylcholinesteraseRecall that Acetyl CoA was obtained from pyruvate via the action of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme. High school!Acetylcholine is generated from acetyl coenzyme A + choline via the choline acetyltransferase enzyme.The Acetyl CoA comes from the mitochondria (makes sense, the Kreb&#8217;s cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix).After it&#8217;s produced, the Ach is stored in a vesicle, so it can be transferred in a quantal nature. The release of Ach is triggered by depolarization, causing an influx of calcium that triggers vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane.Ach is then released into the synaptic cleft.Ach fusion to presynaptic cleft can be blocked by the botulinum toxin.Neostigmine interferes with the breakdown of Ach by acetylcholinesterases.Once the acetylcholine reaches the post-synaptic membrane, it activates a cholinergic receptor.As we said before, this can be:A nicotinic receptorA muscarinic receptorImmediately after binding, membrane-bound Acetylcholinesterases rapidly break down the Ach into choline and acetate.Because Ach is such a powerful neurotransmitter, this inactivation is critical for proper nerve conduction.Cholinergic ReceptorsMuscarinic receptors and nicotinic receptors are very different.They&#8217;re structurally distinct, and they&#8217;re found in different places.This means that we our medications generally target the two independently.Nicotinic ReceptorsNicotinic receptors respond to nicotine &#8594; duh.Basically located in 3 places:The brain &#8594; makes sense, nicotine is addictive.The postganglionic neurons (NN) &#8594; eg. the adrenal medulla.Remember when we mentioned that all the preganglionic neurons were cholinergic?This means that all the postganglionic neurons have to have cholinergic receptors!The neurons here are all nicotinic!The neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle (NM)All the receptors on our skeletal muscles are nicotinic receptors as well!Interestingly, the nicotinic receptors at the postganglionic neurons are very different from the ones at the NMJ!This is useful pharmacologically! We can block nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscles without affecting ganglionic receptors.Nicotinic receptors are ion channel receptors, that cause the influx of Na+ ions.This is a very quick response.As soon as the Ach is broken down by the acetylcholinesterase, the nicotinic receptor closes and the cell can repolarize.If Nicotinic receptors are constantly bombarded by Ach, they can actually stay open &#8594; this can have clinical consequences.Summary of Nicotinic ReceptorsNicotinic Receptors are in 3 places:In the brain.In the post-ganglionic neuronsAt the receiving ends of all neuromuscular junctions for skeletal muscle.The nicotinic receptors in post-ganglionic neurons and neuro-muscular junctions are different enough that we can target them differentially with drugs!Muscarinic ReceptorsMuscarinic receptors are also located in 3 places as well.The post-ganglionic parasympathetic nervous systemSome sympathetic receptors (sweat glands)The brainMuscarinic receptors are G-Protein Coupled Receptors, just like adrenergic receptors.So adrenergic receptors are all GPCRs, while cholinergic receptors can be ion channels (nicotinic) or GPCRs (muscarinic).Summary of Muscarinic ReceptorsMuscarinic Receptors are in 3 places:In the brain.At the end innervation of the PSNS.At the sympathetic sweat gland receptors", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/28/cholinergic-pharmacology-1.html"},
	{"title": "Vascular Pathology", "text": "Today&#8217;s lecture will be on diseases associated with the blood vessels, as oppposed to the heart itself. Three types of vascular diseases will be covered:Atherosclerosis.Aneurysms.Dissections.AtherosclerosisAtherosclerosis is a disease of the large and medium-sized arteries.It&#8217;s a systemic disease with different end-organ syndromes and manifestations.Atherosclerosis has a very slow disease progression &#8594; it takes decades for the disease to become symptomatic.The following are some images of the lining of the aorta as atherosclerosis proceeds.Note: plaques generally don&#8217;t block the aorta since it&#8217;s so wide, but it&#8217;s useful to look at aortas because we can cut them length-wise and see the development of plaques upon autopsy.These are small paired spinal arteries, connected to the lining of the aorta. There are small yellow streak-like areas along the length of the aortic lining. This yellow &#39;fatty streak&#39; is the earliest sign of atherosclerosis.After a long time, this can proceed to become an atherosclerotic plaque. Here is an image of an aorta with protrusions, and yellow areas suggestive of hyperlipidemia. This would be moderate atherosclerosis.This is a case of severe atherosclerosis. You can see complicated plaques here: they&#39;re raised from the surface, ulcerated, secondarily thrombosed, and calcified. It&#39;s pretty nasty!This is an image showing reduced blood flow due to the formation of plaques.They are some examples of coronary artery plaques reducing perfusion.The left on is a concentric plaque, and the one on the right is an eccentric plaque.Eccentric plaques, which form to one side of an artery, are more common.The Response to Injury HypothesisThe Response to Injury Hypothesis is that atherosclerosis is initiated by some form of endothelial injury.There is then an exaggerated repair process (inflammation).Hence, players that are involved in atherosclerosis are the ones we typically see in the injury response: platelets, macrophages, cytokines, etc.This hypothesis is useful to remember because it gives us a systemic approach to predicting risk factors for atherosclerosis!Development of Atherosclerotic PlaquesThese diagrams show plaque progression.The cross-section of the vasculature shows the following layers:The endotheliumIntimal layerMedial layer made of smooth muscleAdventitial layerPlaque forms in the intimal layer, between the endothelium and the medial layer.What starts the cascade is some sort of injury. These need not be mechanical &#8594; they can be biochemical! (eg. hyperlipiedmia, hypertension, etc.)This triggers upregulation of adhesion molecules that make the surface sticky.Inflammatory cells then bind to the surface, such as macrophages.They then secrete cytokines and growth factors, such as IL-1 and TNF-&#945;.This recruits smooth muscle cells into the intima.Once they&#8217;re there, they acquire properties that are more like that of a fibroblast, and then secrete collagen to form the fibrous component of the plaque.The lesion becomes yellow because of the accumulation of lipids, namely cholesterol. This forms the fatty streak that is an early sign of atherosclerosis.Macrophages and smooth muscle cells then engulf the lipid, and form a raised fatty plaque.A plaque is called a fibrofatty plaque if it has a fibrous surface and a fatty core composed of lipid rich necrotic material.These plaques are more prone to rupture and thrombosis, compared to a fibrous plaque.On the right is a real image of a severe fibro-fatty plaque. You can actually see the fibrous outer layer and the fatty inner layer!Risk FactorsThese can be split into major and minor risk factors, as well as modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.Major Non-Modifiable Risk FactorsIncreasing age. &#8594; since it takes a long time to progress, the older you are, the more at risk you are!Male gender. &#8594; estrogen protects women pre-menopausally (it has a cardioprotective effect, probably by affecting the blood-lipid profile). But post-menopause, this protection is lost, and women &#8216;catch up&#8217; in terms of incidence.Family history. &#8594; significant if there&#8217;s a family history of early-onset atherosclerosis.Major Modifiable Risk FactorsThese are the big four modifiable risk factors:Hyperlipidemia &#8594; particularly hypercholesterolemia vs. hypertriglyceridemia. Think about it as supplying substrate for the plaque!Hypertension &#8594; probably because it contributes to endothelial injury and plaque development.Diabetes mellitus &#8594; pathophysiology for the association is still a little unknown.Smoking &#8594; has the biggest impact on atherosclerosis. All the toxic chemicals can obviously cause endothelial damage.Summary of Major Risk FactorsMajor Non-ModifiableIncreasing ageMale genderFamily historyMajor ModifiableHyperlipidemia (esp. hypercholesterolemia)HypertensionDiabetes mellitusSmokingOther Risk FactorsObesityPhysical inactivityStress/ type A personalityPost-menopausal estrogen deficiencyAlcohol (excessive)HyperhomocysteinemiaMany of these may only be indirectly associated, because of confounding factors.Note that risk doesn&#8217;t increase linearly when there&#8217;s multiple risk factors.Instead, there seems to be a superlinear relationship between the number of risk factors and the 10-year risk of ischemic heart disease!So when your patient has more than 1 risk factor, they should be targeted for intervention!Summary of AtherogenesisInitiation and growth of a plaque is a slowly evolving dynamic process with superimposed acute events.Risk factors accelerate progressionPathogenesis is multifactorial; the relative importance of specific genetic and external factors varies in individualsInteractions between cellular and matrix components of the vessel wall and serum constituents, leukocytes, platelets, and physical forces regulate the formation of the fibrofatty plaqueManifestations of AtherosclerosisSince atherosclerosis affects the blood vessels, which communicate with organ systems, they can cause a lot of end-organ symptoms.We&#8217;ll be going through a number of these, except for the heart, which will be covered later.1. The BrainAbove is an example of a carotid bifurcation atheroma.On the left side, there&#8217;s a partially dissected neck exposing the carotid artery.Note the bifurcation of the carotid near the head, splitting into the internal carotid and external carotid.The internal carotid supplies most of the blood to the brain, after branching into the middle cerebral artery.Plaque formation is generally more common in places where there is turbulent blood flow.Hence, plaques tend to form near bifurcations.The top-right image shows occlusion of one of the branches of the carotid due to plaque formation.Here is atherosclerosis at the Circle of willisThe middle cerebral anastamoses around the circle of willis.Here, you can actually see the patchy yellowing caused by the plaque!Without adequate compensatory perfusion, this can cause a cerebral infarct &#8594; an ischemic stroke.This can be preceded by transient ischemic attacks, which can be warning signs of an upcoming stroke.2. The LegsIn peripheral vascular disease, ischemia in the arteries feeding the peripheral limbs can cause pain upon activity.In more serious cases, this can cause limb necrosis, which can be seen above.Thrombi and emboli can also cause blockage in the legs, but these are acute conditions, vs. atherosclerotic plaques, which accumulate chronically.3. The IntestinesAtherosclerosis can result in bowel ischemia.This is somewhat more rare, because we have dual circulation support.As a result, this is usually only caused with severe aortic disease.4. The KidneysSometimes plaques can embolize!Instead of a thromboembolus, this would be an atheroembolus.These atheroemboli can travel to the kidney &#8594; eg. because of a plaque that dislodges from the aorta and enters the renal arteriesHence, atherosclerosis is a vascular disease that can present with a wide variety of end-organ pathology!When doing a review of systems, consider all these areas!In summary, some of the end organ diseases that can occur as a result include:Heart &#8594; Myocardial Infarct, possibly preceded by AnginaBrain &#8594; Cerebral Infarct, possibly preceded by a TIAExtremeties &#8594; Gangrene, possibly preceded by claudication (pain while walking)Intestines &#8594; Ischemic gut, possibly preceded by anginaKidneys &#8594; Cholesterol emboliAorta &#8594; Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)AneurysmsA true aneurysm is a bulge that includes all layers of the vessel wall.A false aneurysm is where there&#8217;s a breach in the wall that allows for blood to enter between the layers. It would actually be a hematoma.Both look like a dilated bulge in the vessel from the outside.False aneurysms often arise iatrogenically due to endothelial damage from puncture catheters.The Abdominal Aortic AneurysmAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta (duh).Since this is retroperitoneal, it usually isn&#8217;t palpable until it has reached a very large size.Because they can rupture, AAAs are surgically dealt with once they exceed a certain size.AAA&#8217;s are typically found incidentally because they don&#8217;t usually cause symptoms.But when they rupture, it&#8217;s catastrophic, and is often fatal.Here is an example of an AAA in its most common location, in the infrarenal aorta. These are easier to deal with because surgical intervention involves clamping of the aorta. If the AAA were above the kidneys, which are sensitive to ischemia, the surgery would have to be done very quickly.One rare complication of an AAA is an aorto-esophageal fistula, where the aorta communicates with the esophagus higher up the chest via an ulcerated aneurysm. But these are exceedingly rare &rarr; we usually only worry about rupture.Repairing Abdominal Aortic AneurysmsConventional Repair &#8594; open surgery, placement of a stent inside the aorta, and closure.Endovascular Repair &#8594; done via catheterization, where the stent is moved to the aorta endovascularly, and expanded.Good in less stable patients, but long-term survival of the stent is not yet known.Hence, typically only done in high-risk patients, although this will probably change in the future once we know more about long-term survival.In both cases, the aneurysm isn&#8217;t actually removed, it&#8217;s just blocked off.Cerebral Berry AneurysmsHere is a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured berry aneurysm.Berry aneurysms typically don&#8217;t cause symptoms until rupture, at which point there may be a headache due to bleeding.Sometimes, large aneurysms can compress a nerve and present with problems with nerve conduction.For instance, it could compress the optic nerve, and cause vision problems.Mycotic AneurysmThis is a bit of a misnomer; when you hear mycotic, you think fungal.But these are not related to fungal infections per se.A mycotic aneurysm is an aneurysm arising from bacterial infection.These are pretty rare as well &#8594; could be because of an embolus dislodging from an infected valve with infective endocarditis.Below is an example.DissectionsYou may sometimes hear the term dissecting aneurysm, but that confuses two different entities.A dissecting artery may look like an aneurysm, but it really isn&#8217;t. It would be a type of false aneurysm.A dissection is a tear in the wall of a blood vessel. This blood then tracks along the vessel within the lining.This can be seen on the right. Note that from the outside, a dissection may look quite similar to an aneurysm.This is another example, with a transverse slice across the artery.You can see two walls. The inner one is a false lumen, while the outer one is a true lumen. All the red stuff between the two is actually blood that has escaped between the two layers due to a dissection!A dissection can even cause a hemopericardium causing fatal cardiac tamponade due to rapid filling of the pericardium.How does this happen? This is because the root of the aorta is still within the pericardial sac! So if a dissection moves its way to the root and ruptures, it can cause blood to be released in the pericardium!Classifying DissectionsThere are 2 classification systems for aortic dissections.There&#8217;s the type 1/2/3 and type A/B classifications.1. Type A/B ClassificationType A = ascending and/or arch of aorta &#8594; intervene surgically.Type B = descending aorta &#8594; typically treated conservatively.2. Type 1/2/3 ClassificationType I - Ascending aorta and aortic arch or further.Type II - Ascending aorta only.Type III - Descending aorta only.Type A = Type I + Type IIEtiology of DissectionsHypertension &#8594; vascular trauma.Marfan&#8217;s Syndrome &#8594; connective tissue weakness.Bicuspid aortic valve &#8594; this reason for this is somewhat unclear.Traumatic injury &#8594; can either cause dissection or complete aortic laceration. Generally occurs where the aorta is tethered to the spine, right past the left subclavian.An inflammatory response (giant cell arteritis, Takayasu disease)", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/27/vascular-pathology.html"},

	{"title": "Clinical Problems in Pediatric Cardiology", "text": "There are 3 major features that typically cause a referral to a pediatric cardiologist:MurmurChest painPalpitationsMurmurs in ChildrenMurmurs are common in children!80% of children have a murmur at some point &#8594; the majority of these are innocent murmurs.But only 1% of children have a congenital heart disease!When you see a murmur in practice, there are 3 possibilities:Innocent murmurA sound made by the vibration of blood through a structurally normal heart.Trivial Heart DiesaseBicuspid Aortic ValveMitral Valve ProlapseTiny VSDSignificant Heart DiseaseASDCoarctation of the AortaNOTE: We have already taken most of the severe heart diseases out of the equation, since most of these will have already presented during the newborn period!The two that can masquerade as a trivial heart disease, are an ASD and Coarctation of the Aorta, as listed above.Generally, mitral valve prolapse in children is pretty benign, unless you have a connective tissue disease, like Marfan&#8217;s.An Approach to the Child with a MurmurHistory: &#8594; of limited utility. (family history)Physical ExaminationCan examine other congenital anomalies &amp; dysmorphic features.Cardiac Exam &#8594; pulses, palpation of the precordium, auscultation.Dysmorphic FeaturesThe child on the right has Down&#8217;s syndrome.About 50% of children with Down&#8217;s syndrome will have a congenital heart defect.We saw DiGeorge Syndrome in I&amp;I! It was also referred to as congenital thymic aplasia, where the thymus fails to develop. This caused frequent infections, due to impaired adaptive immunity.Another disease that raises the risk of CHD (Congenital Heart Disease) is DiGeorge Syndrome.There are also pronounced facies with DiGeorge&#8217;s syndrome, and of course the recurrent risk of infection due to impaired maturation of T-cells.Finally, William&#8217;s Syndome is another genetic disease that can present with cardiac problems, and also often has obvious facies.Pulse AssessmentNoteBeware of an absent femoral pulse!You need to assess the femorals, otherwise you might miss coarctation of the aorta!Palpation of the PrecordiumAtrial level shunts load the right ventricle. &#8594; RV heave.Ventricular shunts, or more downstream ones, like Patent Ductus Arteriosus load the left ventricle.This is because the LV has to pump blood out multiple routes &#8594; increases strain on the heart.Hence we see an active apex.With a VSD, it&#8217;s basically as if the heart is ejecting out the pulmonary artery as well!This means that the RV is basically a passive bystander.With a large VSD, it may cause volume overload in the RV, which can cause both the LV and RV to be active, but in most cases, we usually only feel the stronger apex beat.Summary of PalpationAtrial Level Shunts load the right ventricle and can be seen as an active RV.Ventricular or downstream level shunts load the left ventricle and can be seen in an active apex.AuscultationHow do you distinguish an innocent murmur from a pathological murmur?There are 3 major innocent murmurs of childhood:Still&#8217;s Murmur. &#8594; vibratory systolic ejection murmur. Very common!Pulmonary Flow Murmur. &#8594; Blowing systolic ejection murmur obviously heard near the pulmonic area.Venous HumTiming of the MurmurImportantly, systolic murmurs are frequently innocent, but diastolic murmurs are never innocent.There is no such thing as an innocent diastolic murmur &#8594; it always suggests some sort of underlying pathology!NoteSystolic Murmurs are frequently innocentDiastolic Murmurs are NEVER innocent!Intensity of the MurmurAs we saw before, the classifications of murmur intensity was as follows:Stage I &#8594; Barely audible.Stage II &#8594; Audible.Stage III &#8594; Loud, but not palpable.Stage IV &#8594; Thrill present.Stage V &#8594; Audible when the stethoscope is tilted off the chest wall.Stage VI &#8594; Audible with the stethoscope off the chest wall.Innocent murmurs are always Grade III or less.Once you feel a thrill, it&#8217;s not innocent!NoteIf you feel a thrill (Grade IV intensity or higher), the murmur is not innocent!Quality of the MurmurA harsh murmur is always organic. (Organic = not functional/innocent)A blowing murmur is often innocent (except maybe an ASD).A musical murmur is a classic innocent murmur (it has a &#8216;pure tone&#8217;)These are obviously difficult to differentiate without experience or practice!NoteHarsh murmurs suggest an underlying pathology.Blowing murmurs are often innocent (an ASD is an exception).Musical murmurs are always innocent.Location of the MurmurIn children, we also listen to the heart sounds from the back.This is because coarctation of the aorta may only be heard from the back!.The characteristic locations of the innocent murmurs are:Venous Hum &#8594; Right infraclavicular. &#8594; can hear the humming of the jugular vein.Pulmonary Flow Murmur &#8594; pulmonary artery.Still&#8217;s Murmur &#8594; mid-left sternal border. &#8594; vibratory systolic murmur.NoteThe locations where each of the innocent murmurs are heard best are:Venous Hum &#8594; right infraclavicularPulmonary Flow Murmur &#8594; pulmonary arteryStill&#8217;s Murmur &#8594; mid left sternal borderTypes of MurmursMid-diastolic rumbles are almost never heard in children &#8594; they&#8217;re too quiet!Systolic Ejection MurmurCould be semilunar valve stenosis or high flow across the pulmonary valve (eg. in an ASD)The majority of these are innocent.Pansystolic MurmurCould be Mitral Regurgitation or Tricuspid RegurgitationRecall the logic: during systole, the mitral/tricuspid should be closed, so a systolic murmur can be heard when they&#8217;re abnormally open at this time.In children, the most likely cause is a VSD.Never innocent!Continuous MurmurThere&#8217;s always sound here &#8594; always turbulent flow!There are 24 causes of a continuous murmur in children; you need to know two of them:Patent Ductus Arteriosus &#8594; left infraclavicular. &#8594; not innocentVenous Hum &#8594; right infraclavicular. &#8594; innocent.Early Diastolic MurmurRegurgitation from any of the semilunar valves &#8594; Aortic Regurgitation, Pulmonary Insufficiency, as we saw before.Never innocent.SummarySystolic Ejection Murmur &#8594; mostly innocent, could be due to an ASD, or aortic stenosis.Pansystolic Murmur &#8594; most likely to be a VSD in children.Could also be Mitral Regurgitation or Tricuspid Regurgitation.Never InnocentContinuous MurmurPatent Ductus Arteriosus &#8594; left infraclavicular (up from pulmonary area) &#8594; not innocentVenous Hum &#8594; right infraclavicular &#8594; innocentEarly Diastolic MurmurAortic Regurgitation or Tricuspid RegurgitationNever innocent.Heart Sounds in Congenital Heart DiseaseEjection ClickFollows S1 &#8594; stenotic semilunar valve (AS, PS)So, if you take an unimpressive, blowing systolic ejection murmur, and add in a click, it&#8217;s probably a bicuspid aortic valve!S2 should split with inspiration!A wide fixed split S2 is suggestive of an ASD &#8594; we saw this before!So, if we have a blowing, systolic ejection murmur + a wide, split S2 &#8594; ASDWhen do you Worry?Worry about murmurs in infancy that persist beyond a year of age.Worry about murmurs heard best in the back &#8594; coarctation!.Chronic Recurrent Chest Pain in ChildrenSince it&#8217;s chronic, it doesn&#8217;t suggest any acute inflammation like pericarditis.In the case of chronic chest pain, it&#8217;s rarely cardiac!This makes sense, since children don&#8217;t get coronary artery disease.But, as usual, there are some exceptions, listed below:Potential Cardiac Causes of Pediatric Chest PainSevere aortic stenosis &#8594; this usually doesn&#8217;t present as chest pain; it presents as a loud murmur!Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy &#8594; again, other symptoms typically present first!Congenital coronary artery anomalyThis is rare, but it exists!Instead of having a left coronary and a right coronary, some people have a single coronary.The anatomical position of the left anterior descending then moves between the two great arteries.During exercise, the great arteries dilate &#8594; clamping the LAD &#8594; ischemia and chest pain.Differential Diagnosis for Pediatric Chest PainMuscular Skeletal ProblemsCostochondritisPrecordial catch syndrome &#8594; a stitchSore chest from running.Gastrointestinal - Sometimes, it could be due to GE reflux.In most of these cases, the pain is just &#8216;near&#8217; the chest!Oftentimes, a child can&#8217;t effectively clarify the location of the pain.Differentiating Good Chest Pain from Bad Chest PainGood &#8594; Probably not CardiacAt rest or with exercise.Well localized. &#8594; angina is usually more diffuse.Stabbing, burning &#8594; sounds more somatic, not visceral.Made worse by deep breaths. &#8594; probably associated with the chest wall.No associated symptoms.Relieved by position or antacidsBad &#8594; Could be Cardiac!Only with exercise.Poorly localized &#8594; more suggestive of angina.Crushing or pressing pain.Unaffected by respiration.Nausea, syncope.Relieved only by rest.But even so, we could take a child with all the bad features, and 99% of the time, it&#8217;s not cardiac!Physical examination is rarely helpful &#8594;, maybe you can reproduce pain via compression. This makes it less likely to be cardiac.ECGs are rarely helpful. The more tests we do, the more likely that one will be abnormal by chance!A stress test can be done for reassurance., while on an ECG.Palpitations in ChildrenPalpitations can be due to:An Irregular Heart BeatA Racing HeartIrregular Heart BeatSinus ArrythmiaHR changes with inspiration and expiration due to differing sinus enervation.always benignAtrial Premature Beatsalways benign as well.An example os shown on the right &#8594; early p-wave stimulation.Ventricular Premature BeatsThis is almost always benign.Check to make sure there isn&#8217;t a myocardial tumour.Also check for FHx for cases of people dropping dead, syncope, presyncope, etc.Racing HeartSinus tachycardiaSurprisingly, most of our referrals are for normal tachycardia upon exercise.But children don&#8217;t know that this is normal!Supraventricular tachycardia &#8594; this is rareVentricular Tachycardia &#8594; this is very very rareSinus Tachycardia vs Supraventricular Tachycardia            Sinus Tachcardia        Supraventricular Tachycardia            	Only with vigorous exercise or excitement.    	At rest or with exercise.            	Comes on gradually and goes away gradually.    	Can have a sudden onset as well as a sudden offset.            	No syncope or presyncope.    	Hx of syncope or presyncope.    InvestigationsECG to look for signs of SVT.Symptom diary do determine the severity of symptoms.Holter monitor if frequent events. This is basically a 24 ECG monitor of the child.Kawasaki&#8217;s SyndromeFirst described in Japan by Dr. Kawasaki.Self limited, small vessel arteritis.We still don&#8217;t know what causes it! We suspect it&#8217;s a superantigen.80% present at &#60; 5 years of age.Male preponderance.Asian &#62; Black &#62; Caucasian.It is a clinical syndrome &#8594; we have no lab test for it yet.5 days of fever plus 4 of:Cervical LympadenopathyConjunctivitisMucous membrane changes (eg. the strawberry tongue)RashExtremity ChangesThis kind of sounds like a viral infection! It&#8217;s very difficult to diagnose.Why is this pediatric cardiology problem?Because it affects the small arteries, and some of the most important small arteries are the coronary arteries.This can cause aneurysmal dilation of the coronary arteries.Aneurysms occur in 18% of untreated.This decreases to 8% if treated with high dose Ig&#8217;s and ASA &#8594; important to recognize!Mortality ~0.1%.Criteria for Kawasaki&#8217;s Disease5 days of fever as well as 4 of:Cervical LympadenopathyConjunctivitisMucous membrane changes (eg. the strawberry tongue)RashExtremity Changes", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/24/clinical-problems-pediatric-cardiology.html"},

	{"title": "Surgical Management in Valvular Disease", "text": "Take Home Points from this LectureInsufficient valves can be commonly repaired.Stenotic valves need to be replaced.Valve repair restores life expectancy, and outcomes are excellent.The valves of the heart. The atrioventricular valves have a large surface area, but a small pressure gradient. The semilunar valves have a smaller orifice area, but a much higher pressure gradient.Valve Replacement for Aortic StenosisAortic Stenosis and Mitral Insufficiency are the two most common valvular heart lesions that you see.Recall that AS causes ASD symptoms &#8594; Angina, Syncope, Dyspnea (heart failure). Angina has a 50% mortality at 5 years, syncope has a 50% morality at 3 years, CHF at 2 years.The overall survival is 75% at 3 years &#8594; pretty bad!But with aortic valve replacement, survival almost normalizes with the general population.As we saw before, there&#8217;s no pharmacological treatment for AS. In fact, most are contraindicated.If you reduce afterload by dropping the blood pressure, this can drop coronary perfusion!If you exercise, CO must increase, but supply can&#8217;t increase to compensate.The only treatment for AS is surgery.Any of the ASD symptoms are indications for surgery.Even if they&#8217;re asymptomatic, signs of LV compromise such as a reduced LVEF could be indications.1.

	{"title": "Exercise Physiology", "text": "The Venous SystemThis lecture will focus on efferent feedback from sensory systems.Recall that the venous system functions as a reservoir for blood - 70% of the blood volume is in the veins.Venous capacity can be regulated by autonomic enervationSNS stimulation increases venous tone.PSNS stimulation decreases venous tone.Nitrates such as nitroglycerine can also cause vasodilation via the generation of NO &#8594; cGMP&#8593;Standing for a long time can cause pooling in the veins.This is typically counteracted by the baroreflex and ANS stimulationWhy is there a greater venous response than an arteriolar response to vasodilation?The volume of the arteries can&#8217;t change much, even with large changes in pressure.Comparatively, the same change in tone for the venous system can cause a large change in volume.Consequently, arteriolar volume is usually static, while venous volume is very dynamic.Since veins are more distensible, a change in sympathetic tone goes further with the veins than with the arteries!The Effects of GravityWhy do people feel faint when they stand up?Fluid volume shifts down due to gravityThis causes accumulation of blood in the peripheral limbs.Gravity creates a gradient of hydrostatic pressure, with high hydrostatic pressure distally.This makes it difficult for the heart to force the blood back up.How do we oppose this problem?Baroreceptors in the carotid sense a drop in BP &#8594; HR&#8593; and SNS&#8593;.There are also postural muscles around the veins that help return blood. When these muscles flex, venous pressure increases!Finally, there are valves in the veins that maintain one-way flow!These features can work in concert to help direct venous flow.The Muscle PumpBlood can be pumped up the veins with muscles.How this works is that during contraction, blood is forced up the veins because the muscles apply pressure.When the muscle relaxes, the blood can&#8217;t flow back down because of the valves!Hence, when we have rhythmic pumping of the muscles, such as when we walk, the muscles help pump blood back to the heart.The figure below shows that this can actually serve to alleviate venous pressure when you are standing!Note that when you lie down, even though increased pressure in the carotids triggers a reduced HR via the baroreflex, the increased return because of the reduced pressure gradient more than offsets that.Hence, cardiac output increases when you&#8217;re lying down.This is a graph showing venous pressure. There are peaks when the muscles contract due to walking. Note how rhythmic walking alleviates pressure in the veins by helping pump blood out of them. When the patient stopped walking, the pressure built up again.The Respiratory PumpWhen you breathe in, negative pressure in the thorax is created.This pulls blood into the right side of the heart, out of the veins.On expiration, the pressure returns to normal, but valves prevent backflow, as before!This helps maintain venous flow.Cardiovascular Responses to ExerciseIn a healthy individual:Cardiac output can increase by around 4-6 fold.Heart Rate can increase by around 2-4 fold.Stroke volume can increase by around 2 fold.During exercise, the distribution of blood changes.Flow is redistributed to the muscles and skin.As we saw earlier, vasodilation in skeletal muscle is mediated by sympathetic enervation of &#946;-2 adrenergic receptors by Norepinephrine.Vasoconstriction elsewhere occurs because of &#945;-1 adrenergic receptorsThere is generally no change in blood flow to the brain.This is because the brain is extremely sensitive to changes in blood flow, so it has very rapid mechanisms to regulate its perfusion.A flowchart outlining the changes in physiology upon exercise. Decreased vagal stimulation and increased sympathetic stimulation causes an increase in heart rate and contractility, increasing cardiac output. SNS stimulation also redistributes flow to skeletal muscles, as described previously.Factors that Modify our Response to ExerciseDuring exercise, oxygen uptake increases.With increased work, the body actually produces cytokines typically associated with infection, like TNF-&#945; and IL-1. These modify body temperature and cause vasodilation.VO2 max increases with training and decreases with prolonged bed rest.Long-term, training increases vascularization and heart size, and increases vagal enervation.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/23/exercise-physiology.html"},
	{"title": "An Outline of Congenital Heart Disease", "text": "This lecture covers the basic concepts of congenital heart disease.Not much of this is useful clinically, but it&#8217;s useful to know conceptually!An Outline of Fetal CirculationThe placenta is the organ of respiration.The lungs are basically non-functional at this time &#8594; blood flow to the lungs is of little importance.There are shunts that allow the right ventricle to do the majority of the work. These passages allow for the lungs to be bypassed.The ductus arteriosus between the pulmonary artery and the arch of the aorta.The foramen ovale between the two atria.The ductus venosus between the left umbilical vein and the IVC. It allows oxygenated blood from the placenta to bypass the liver.There is a high pressure (high resistance) pulmonary circulation.This difference in fetal circulation means that a baby that&#8217;s healthy in utero may be acutely sick after birth!Recall that we had that:Resistance = Pressure/FlowSo if we have a higher pressure, but the same flow &#8594; R&#8593;If P&#8593; &amp; F&#8593; equally, resistance is maintained.Pretty straightforward!Transitional CirculationThis is how we transition from fetal circulation to adult circulationThe lungs become the organ of respirationAdequacy of pulmonary blood flow becomes critical now!The pulmonary vascular pressure must fall dramatically! Since P = F &#215; R, this means that the resistance must fallThe shunts disappear &#8594; both ventricles must function!The ductus arteriosus closes to become the ligamentum arteriosum.The foramen ovale closes to become the fossa ovalis.The ductus venosus closes to become the ligamentum venosum.The above diagram illustrates this.The thin-dotted line is the pulmonary pressure.The thick-dotted line is the pulmonary flow.The solid line is the pulmonary resistance.With the first breath, the pulmonary pressure begins to drop &#8594; the vessels mechanically open!Simultaneously, the flow shoots up.Consequently, the resistance drops dramatically (R = P/F).Without this rapid drop in resistance, the baby cannot transition to post-natal life!They&#8217;ll be profoundly cyanotic &#8594; shock &#8594; death.Summary of Fetal &amp; Transitional CirculationIn the fetus, the placenta is the organ of respiration.Upon birth, the lung is the organ of respiration.The fetal pulmonary circulation has high resistance. This circulation is bypassed in the fetus with shunts.Upon birth, decreased pressure and increased flow cause a sharp reduction in pulmonary resistance. Without this, the baby can&#8217;t survive!Summary of Fetal ShuntsDuctus arteriosus &#8594; Ligamentum arteriosumDuctus venosus &#8594; Ligamentum venosumForamen ovale &#8594; Fossa ovalisAn Outline of Congenital Heart DiseaseCongenital Heart diseases can be split into two categories:Pink (Acyanotic) &#8594; normal oxygen saturation (98-99% O2)Normal Pulmonary Blood Flow &#8594; Valve LesionsIncreased Pulmonary Blood Flow &#8594; Shunt LesionsBlue (Cyanotic) &#8594; reduced oxygen saturation.Acyanotic Congenital Heart DiseaseNormal Pulmonary Blood FlowWhen the baby is acyanotic and there&#8217;s normal pulmonary blood flow.These are due to a valve lesion.These were what we&#8217;ve already covered:Aortic RegurgitationMitral RegurgitationAortic StenosisMitral StenosisPulmonary Stenosis, etc.The concepts with treatment of these in children are somewhat different.Treatment needs to last for a lifetime! Any valve-repair or replacement must be long-term.Additionally, the subtrate is different. Rather than seeing calcifications or scarring, you see congenital malformations! Examples include:Unicuspid valves.Parachute mitral valves &#8594; only one papillary muscle instead of two per cusp!Increased Pulmonary Blood FlowWith increased pulmonary blood flow, plethora, or an overfullness of the blood vessels, occurs.This excess blood flow can be seen in the CXR to the right.These cases are caused by shunt lesions.With a shunt lesion, oxygenated blood crosses from the left side of the heart to mix with deoxygenated blood on the right side.1. Atrial Level ShuntAn Atrial Septal Defect.Blood flow from the LA &#8594; RA &#8594; RV &#8594; PA.As a consequence, there is increased pulmonary circulation.Blood flows from the left to the right with a shunt because the left ventricle is much thicker. Hence there&#8217;s more resistance on the left side of the heart than the right.The normal pressure difference between the two sides is actually equalized as soon as a shunt is formed. But this difference in resistance means that blood will preferentially flow to the region of less resistance.2. Ventricular Level ShuntA Ventricular Septal DefectBlood from the LV &#8594; RV &#8594; PA &#8594; increased pulmonary blood flow.In this case, L &#8594; R flow is actually due to pressure.The left ventricular pressure is higher than the right ventricular pressure immediately after the first few hours of life, because of differing wall tensions and wall-thicknesses.3. Great Artery Level ShuntThe archetypical example of this is a patent ductus arteriosus.Normally, the ductus arteriosus closes after birth to become the ligamentum arteriosum.With a patent ductus arteriosus, the ductus arteriosum fails to close, maintaining communication between the pulmonary artery and the arch of the aorta.But now, the flow is reversed! Blood transitions to travel from the aorta to the pulmonary artery just hours after birth. This is because:The pulmonary resistance falls after birth, as seen previously.The systemic resistance rises once the low-resistance placenta is clamped out.So the shunt then reverses directions to go from high resistance &#8594; low resistance.Thus we have blood flow from the Aorta &#8594; PA &#8594; lungs, causing increased pulmonary circulation.Summary of Acyanotic Congenital Heart DiseaseAcyanotic Congenital Heart Disease can present with either normal pulmonary blood flow or elevated pulmonary blood flowNormal Pulmonary Blood Flow = Valve LesionsAortic RegurgitationMitral RegurgitationAortic StenosisMitral StenosisPulmonary Stenosis, etc.Elevated Pulmonary Blood Flow = Shunt LesionsAtrial Level Shunteg. an Atrial Septal DefectBlood flows from the LA &#8594; RA &#8594; RV &#8594; lungsVentricular Level Shunteg. a Ventricular Septal DefectBlood flows from the LV &#8594; RV &#8594; lungsGreat Artery Level Shunteg. a Patent Ductus ArteriosusBlood flows from the LV &#8594; Aorta &#8594; Pulmonary Artery &#8594; lungsCyanotic Congenital Heart DiseaseDecreased Pulmonary Blood FlowThis makes sense &#8594; less pulmonary blood flow = less oxygen intakeThe image on the right is a CXR example of this.Note that the pulmonary segment is missing on the CXR, suggesting that the pulmonary arteries are very small.We also don&#8217;t really see any pulmonary vasculature at all!Here, it makes sense that the child is blue!1. Tetralogy of FallotTetralogy of Fallot is the archetypical lesion presening with decreased pulmonary blood flow and a blue baby.There are two things going on:RVOT Obstruction: (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction) there&#8217;s an obstruction getting out of the RV into the pulmonary arteries.Shunt: There&#8217;s an alternative path for the blood to go. (a VSD)Hence, in Tetralogy of Fallot, normal flow out of the RV to the pulmonary artery is reduced by a RVOT Obstruction, and a VSD provides an alternative path out of the RV, to the LV.Normal blood flow goes from RA &#8594; RV &#8594; PA &#8594; lungs &#8594; LA &#8594; LV &#8594; AortaIn Tetralogy of Fallot, we have flow from RA &#8594; RV &#8594; LV &#8594; AortaThe lungs are completely bypassed. Some deoxygenated blood ends up in the aorta!Because we still have some degree of flow out the pulmonary artery, this may still be compatible with life to a certain extent!Increased Pulmonary Blood FlowThis is a little counterintuitive.The kid is blue, so they have decreased oxygen saturation.But paradoxically, their lungs are well perfused!The CXR on the right is from a cyanotic baby, but it actually shows vasculature, and so much blood flow that we see pulmonary edema!There are a few ways this can happen:1. d-Transposition of the Great ArteriesThe aorta and the pulmonary artery are transposed across the septum &#8594; they switch places.Now instead of a figure-8 flow of blood between the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation, we have interlocking-loops!Normal circulation is like this:Body &#8594; RA &#8594; RV &#8594; PA &#8594; Lungs &#8594; PV &#8594; LA &#8594; LV &#8594; AO &#8594; BodyWith d-Transposition, we have two separate circuits:Body &#8594; RA &#8594; RV &#8594; Aorta &#8594; BodyLungs &#8594; PV &#8594; LA &#8594; LV &#8594; PA &#8594; LungsWe end up with a two closed loops: one with nothing but oxygenated blood, and another with nothing but deoxygenated blood!Hence we have normal pulmonary blood flow, but that oxygenated blood can&#8217;t get to the rest of the body!Note that in utero, the fetus remained viable because the ductus arteriosus allowed for flow between the two great vessels.How do we resolve this?We need a quick way to at least allow for mixing of the blood before the baby dies.This is done with a balloon atrial septostomy.You take a balloon tip catheter, and insert it into the foramen ovale.Then you blow up the balloon, pull it back into the IVC, and create an atrial septal defect.Now the deoxygenated blood and the oxygenated blood can mix &#8594; the patient can survive until a more permanent fix can be done!The time we have to perform this procedure varies depending on whether there is any other form of communication between the two loops (eg. a patent foramen ovale), or not.2. Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous ReturnThis one is complicated.Here we have two problems.Pulmonary veins communicate with a systemic vein.Pulmonary veins fail to connect to the left atrium.As a result, instead of connecting to the RA, the pulmonary veins communicate with a systemic vein.You can kind of think of this as switching around the input, versus with d-transposition, where we switched the outputs (the aorta and pulmonary artery)This is because now, the oxygenated blood eventually gets to the RA first, instead of the LA.The pulmonary vein can communicate with a few systemic veins:1. A Vertical VeinIf you&#8217;re lucky, the pulmonary vein will communicate with a vertical vein that feeds into the superior vena cava.Oxygenated blood then ends up in the right atrium, where it mixes with deoxygenated blood &#8594; &#8216;purple blood&#8217;.This purple blood then enters the left atrium is through a patent foramen ovale.All newborns have a patent foramen ovale for a few days.With increased atrial flow, this can remain open!Hence, what ends up being sent to the LA &#8594; LV is actually a combination of deoxygenated blood from the body, and oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins.2. The Hepatic VeinIf you&#8217;re unlucky, the pulmonary vein may go beneath the diaphragm, and connect with the hepatic vein, and end up crossing the ductus venosus.This then feeds into the RA just like when the pulmonary veins communicate with a vertical vein.There&#8217;s only one problem:When the ductus venosus closes, you&#8217;re trying to squeeze all the pulmonary blood through a tiny passageway &#8594; obstruction!This causes profound cyanosis because of sharply reduced flow of the oxygenated blood &#8594; poor prognosis.3. Truncus ArteriosusTruncus arteriosus is rare, but has great embryology!In truncus arteriosus, instead of having separate roots for the pulmonary artery and the aorta, you have one combined root for both.This combined root then communicates with both ventricles &#8594; there&#8217;s a ventricular septal defect as wellThis is because of a failure of septation of the primitive truncus.The truncus arteriosus needs to septate into the PA and Aorta.In truncus arteriosus, this septation fails to happen!The oxygen saturation of the baby depends on how much blood flow there is from the pulmonary arteries!But regardless, they&#8217;ll generally have lower saturations because the oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood mix.Summary of Cyanotic Congenital Heart DiseasesCyanotic Congenital Heart Disease can present with either decreased pulmonary blood flow or increased/normal pulmonary blood flow.Decreased Pulmonary Blood FlowTetralogy of FallotA RVOT obstruction combined with a VSD means that blood can bypass the pulmonary circulationIncreased Pulmonary Blood Flowd-Transposition of the Great ArteriesThe aorta and pulmonary artery are switched, creating two disconnected loops of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous ReturnThe pulmonary veins connect with a systemic vein, instead of the LA &#8594; oxygenated blood mixes with deoxygenated blood in the RA.Truncus ArteriosusThe roots of the aorta and PA are joined, and there&#8217;s a VSD. So all the oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood mixes!Grey Heart DiseaseThis is technically a subset of acyanotic congenital heart diseases.These babies are cyanotic and in shock.They&#8217;re usually very ill &#8594; tachypnic, tachycardic, etc.They&#8217;re caused by a critical LVOT obstruction &#8594; blood can&#8217;t leave the LV!1. Coarctation of the AortaThe most common &#8216;gray-heart disease&#8217;.Critical narrowing of the &#8216;juxtaductal&#8217; aorta.Blood can&#8217;t get past the obstruction &#8594; shock.Presentation of this is often delayed by a few hours.These children usually don&#8217;t present in the first few days of life.This is because the ductus arteriosus is still open.This allows for some RV support for the circulation, and it also keeps the obstruction somewhat open.When the duct closes, we suddenly have critical obstruction, causing shock.This dependence on the ductus arteriosum gives us a neat medical treatment:Since prostaglandins keep the ductus arteriosum open, we can give exogenous prostaglandins to reopen the duct!This buys us more time!2. Critical Aortic StenosisThis is usually because of a unicuspid aortic valve that is highly dysplastic.Here, we again can&#8217;t get blood out of the LV, and can&#8217;t supply the organs &#8594; shock.Again, we can reopen the ductus arteriosus with prostaglandins, and let the RV support the circulation via oxygenated blood through the foramen ovale.This will be effective until the pulmonary resistance falls to the point where excessive pulmonary blood flow causes heart failure.It still buys us a few days for surgery!3. Hypoplastic Left Heart SyndromeWe started from the aorta, moved to the aortic valve, and now we&#8217;re looking at the left heart itself!In Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, the left side of the heart doesn&#8217;t develop.We usually see decreased flow across the fossa ovalis as well.This is the root behind one theory for why LV hypoplasia occurs, that the reduced blood flow across the foramen ovale in utero affects development of the LV.Because the LV is small, blood has to flow from the LA &#8594; RA through the narrow fossa ovalis.For a while, the ductus arteriosus is enough to support circulation, as before.But long-term, we need to intervene, or provide comfort care (the long term outlook for this is poor).Summary of Grey Heart DiseaseGrey heart disease is cyanotic congenital heart disease + shock because blood can&#8217;t leave the heart!Coarctation of the AortaThe juxtaductal aorta is narrowed, and blood can&#8217;t get through.Critical Aortic StenosisBlood can&#8217;t exit through the aortic valve because of severe dysplasia (typically a unicuspid valve).Hypoplastic Left Heart SyndromeThe left side of the heart fails to develop properly, so blood can&#8217;t leave.These are easy to remember working distally to proximally.From the aorta &#8594; aortic valve &#8594; LV, we have Coarctation of the Aorta &#8594; Critical Aortic Stenosis &#8594; Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/23/outline-congenital-heart-disease.html"},
	{"title": "Interpreting ECGs II", "text": "Today, we&#8217;ll be looking at:Bradycardia &#8594; &lt; 60 bpmTachycardia &#8594; &gt; 100 bpmIschemia/InfarctBradycardiaThis could be normal, due to excess vagal stimulation, but it could also be abnormal.Broadly speaking, there are two possible causes for this:Impaired Impulse Formation &#8594; the node isn&#8217;t producing the impulse properly!Impaired Impulse Conduction &#8594; the impulse isn&#8217;t moving properly.AV node problemBundle branch problemImpaired ConductionFirst describe what you see:Rate, axis, QRS morphology, P-wave morphology, etc.The above is an ECG from a 58 y/o woman presenting with fatigueHR is a little slow, &lt; 60 for the first few beats.This is sinus bradycardia, because we see a sinus rhythm, and normal wave morphology.Note that the HR changes around the 5th beat.This is an example of how where the sinus node doesn&#8217;t do it&#8217;s job, another part of the heart will pace!Here, the p-wave never came, but there&#8217;s still a QRS complex.Something else paced when the SA node failed to do so!When the P-wave came back, we returned to sinus rhythm.This may have been a junctional escape beat or a ventricular escape beat.These escape beats protect us in cases where the SA node doesn&#8217;t fire properly.In cases where the SA node fails completely, we typically transition to a junctional escape rhythm.The junction (AV node + his bundle) usually beats at 40-60 bpm.If that fails, we then go to the Ventricular Escape Rhythm at 20-40 bpm.We can tell if it was a Ventricular Escape Beat if there&#8217;s no P-wave, and we see a wide/odd QRS.The loss of the P-wave is because we lost SA pacing for that beat.The wide/odd QRS is because the ventricular cardiomyocytes have to do the pacing!Sometimes, you see a P-wave after the QRS complex because the atrium will get depolarized afterwards during ventricular contraction.But this is not too common because the ventricle to atrium conduction isn&#8217;t as good as the atrium to ventricle conduction in the heart.It&#8217;s sort of like an ethernet cable! Good downstream, crappy upstream!SummaryIf the SA node fails, we lose the p-wave.We transition from a Sinus Rate &#8594; Junctional Escape Rate &#8594; Ventricular Escape Rate.Junctional Escape Rate &#8594; 40-60 bpmVentricular Escape Rate &#8594; 20-40 bpmThe above is from a 55 y/o man, preop for hand surgeryHR around 65 bpm (a little less than 5 large squares).This isn&#8217;t even bradycardia!Here we see P-waves, but the PR interval is long.We see 7 small boxes = 280 ms. Normally it should be less than 5 small boxes!.This means that there&#8217;s probably slowed conduction at the AV-node or the His/Purkinje system.This can be normal, with high PSNS tone.This is termed a first-degree AV-delay/first-degree AV block.The dip in the ECG is because the patient moved! Always be careful when you see the entire waveform dip, as opposed to just a segment.Bradycardia, HR &lt; 60. (50 bpm)We see P-waves, but they&#8217;re not associated with the QRS at all! In fact, the P-waves are firing at 100 bpm.Here we see two SA impulses for every one QRS complex firing.This is a two-to-one AV block, a type of Second-degree AV-block.3.5 blocks, so around 85 bpm for the HR.Here, if you look at II, you see that since the P-wave and the T-wave were so close to one another, the firing of the P-wave occurred while the ventricles were still repolarizing!The PR interval lengthens, a QRS drops, and then PR interval shortens again.This is a Mobitz I/Wenckebach Type conduction delay (a type of second-degree AV-block). It&#8217;s almost always associated with a disease of the AV node.The other type of second-degree AV block is Mobitz II/Hay block, where the distal conduction system is diseased, ie. the His-Purkinje system. This is usually more dangerous, and treatment would typically involve a pacemaker.There&#8217;s also a sharply negative R-wave in V2 &amp; V3, and a steeply positive R-wave in V5, V6. This suggests some LV hypertrophy.SummaryFirst-degree AV-block &#8594; PR &gt; 0.2 s (1 big box)Second-degree AV-block &#8594; 1 or more of the atrial impulses fail to conduct to the AV node.Type 1 (Mobitz I/Wenckebach) &#8594; progressive lengthening of the PR interval &#8594; dropped QRS &#8594; shortening of the PR again. Suggestive of AV node disease.Type 2 (Mobitz II/Hay) &#8594; PR is normal, but you see dropping of the QRS! Suggestive of His/Purkinje disease. More dangerous!Third-degree AV-block &#8594; None of the atrial impulses conduct to the AV-node. So the P-waves and QRS-complexes will be completely disassociated with one anonother!The patient presented with dizziness, 2 episodes of syncope.HR around 30 bpm &#8594; ventricular escape rhythm!However, the P-waves are firing at around 75 bpm, which is normal!This would be a Third-degree AV block because they&#8217;re complete disconnection between the P-waves and the QRS-complex.So this is sinus rhythm with a third-degree AV block, causing a ventricular escape rhythm.This patient needs a pacemaker to replace the conduction system!This could also theoretically be a case where every 3rd or so P-wave was conducting, which wouldn&#8217;t quite be a third-degree AV-block.But if this were the case, the PR-interval would look the same at each of these points! We don&#8217;t see that here.The patient is 55 y/o, presents with hypertension.HR around 50 bpm.Don&#8217;t see P-waves before the QRS complex.This suggests a junctional rhythm. (40-60 bpm, loss of SA enervation)Here we can actually see a P-wave firing after the QRS due to the transmission of the ectopic impulse to the atria, as we mentioned before.TachycardiaFast, irregular rhythm &#8594; atrial fibrillation. This is where we have disorganized electrical activity in the atria.Impulses still gets filtered through the AV node, but irregularly.So regularity is very important in narrowing our differential!32 y/o man presenting with palpitations.This patient is actually in sinus rhythm at the beginning of the recording.Then something happens, and everything becomes irregular.This is a good example of the onset of the tachycardia.This seems to be pretty irregular &#8594; different RR intervals after onsetNarrow complex, irregular rhythm &#8594; atrial fibrillation!You may see something that looksl ike a P-wave in some beats, but if it isn&#8217;t regular, it probably isn&#8217;t a P-wave.Atrial fibrillation is probably the most common type of tachycardia you&#8217;ll see in practice.Recall, that atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events because of stagnant flow in the atria. This could possibly cause a stroke.Assessing the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is done with the CHADS2 Score.C &#8594; Congestive Heart FailureH &#8594; HypertensionA &#8594; Age over 75D &#8594; DiabetesS2 &#8594; Prior StrokeIf a patient has one or more or these, then they&#8217;re at risk, and they should go on anticoagulation prophylaxis.The CHADS2 scorePatients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter should go on prophylactic anticoagulation if they have one or more of:C &#8594; Congestive Heart FailureH &#8594; HypertensionA &#8594; Age over 75D &#8594; DiabetesS2 &#8594; Prior Stroke54 y/o woman, occasional heart racing.Here we see QRS complexes that fire in groups.Within each group, the heart rate is regular.Looking at the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), we see a characteristic sawtooth pattern in the inferior leads.This is atrial flutter.Atrial flutter is also abnormal like atrial fibrillation, but it has a regular rhythm.The conduction is stuck in a loop in the atrium, causing it to go back and forth. This creates the characteristic inverted sawtooth pattern we see here.This only conducts variably through the AV node, so you see a regular rate when it conducts, but only in bunches.So this is atrial flutter with variable AV conduction.This also confers a risk of stroke, so we also use the CHADS2 score here.Acute treatment of atrial flutter is cardioversion (a shock), to get them out of the flutter.A more definitive treatment would be an antiarrhythmic, or catheter ablation.34 y/o woman. Heart races when she bends forward. Can stop the racing by holding her breath.Here we have a narrow, regular QRS.It&#8217;s coming very quickly, and we don&#8217;t see a P-wave. You actually can see some atrial activity in a small blip seen immediately after the S-wave, which disappears upon re-entry into a normal sinus rhythm.This is AV node re-entry &#8594; Conduction goes in a loop around the AV-node.So this is AV node re-entrant tachycardia.It&#8217;s not dangerous but is symptomatic. Doesn&#8217;t cause heart attacks, cardiac damage, or sudden death.When you cough/bear down, the vagal node enervation through the AV node changes. This causes the abnormal conduction to terminal when you cough sometimes!Another way to do this is to give adenosine &#8594; it&#8217;s a medication that acts directly on the AV node.42 y/o man, palpitations.Tachycardic (~ 150 bpm). Regular rhythm. Wide QRS.A wide QRS is suggestive of a bundle branch block or ventricular pacing.With a wide complex QRS tachycardia, the differential is:AV-Node re-entry, or some other type of superventricular tachycardia.Ventricular tachycardiaPacingPre-excitation &#8594; if someone has WPW syndrome, can also cause a wide complex.This is ventricular tachycardia, because we see some random normal beats, suggesting that even though the ventricles are going on their own, a P-wave that made it through the AV-node managed to cause a normal narrow beat.These capture beats are only seen in ventricular tachycardia.This does not seem like a normal BBB because of the shape of the end of the QRS. It&#8217;s pretty strange!Also, a wide complex tachycardia is ventricular tachycardia unless proven otherwise!NoteA capture beat is pathognomonic for ventricular tachycardia!A wide complex tachycardia is VT unless proven otherwise!Ischemia/Infarction56 y/o man, diabetic, short of breath.Normal rate and rhythm.You see ST-depression in some leads (I, VI, VII), and ST-elevation in the inferior leads (II, II, aVF).We also see T-wave inversion.The ST-elevation is more concerning, because it&#8217;s suggestive of an infarction versus ischemia.This suggests an MI in the inferior walls of the heart, based on the location of the ST-elevated leads. Since the right coronary artery feeds the interior wall, this is probably RCA occlusion.67 y/o man. To hospital after 4 hours &#39;indigestion&#39;ST elevation in V4, V5, V6, suggesting a lateral infarction, since it&#8217;s in the lateral leads.The baseline shifting is because of the patient motion/breathing, as we saw before.The patient needs immediate thrombolysis or angioplasty.72 y/o man. 3 hrs of central chest tightness.ST elevation in the inferior leads. ST-depression mainly in V2.Again, this is an inferior infarction.42 y/o man.

	{"title": "Endocarditis", "text": "Endocarditis: Inflammation of the endocardium. Typically we&#8217;re referring to infective endocarditis.More specifically, we&#8217;re usually looking at a vascular infection (usually valvular), with a local collection of fibrinous material with a superimposed infection.The fibrous tissue is a result of an immune response to the infection.Some examples of infective endocarditis.

Viruses don&#8217;t cause endocarditis.Cardiovascular support would include diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropes.Antibacterial AgentsIn I&amp;I, we saw that &beta;-lactams and Aminoglycosides have a synergistic effect when used together! This was because the &beta;-lactam would punch a hole in the bacterial cell wall, and the aminoglycoside would enter and interfere with protein synthesis.Empirically (blindly), treatment consists of a penicillin (for any Strep. infection), and an aminoglycoside (like Tobramycin or Gentamicin).Glycopeptides (Vancomycin) are used if a suspected resistant organism is involved &#8594; organisms that produce a &#946;-lactamase, such as MRSA.Penicillins are &#946;-lactams, so they affect cell-wall synthesis.Aminoglycosides inhibit protein synthesisRecall that the antibiotics that affected protein synthesis were MCAT-L &#8594; Macrolides, Clindamycin, Aminoglycosides, Tetracyclines, Linezolid)Side EffectsOne of the rare side-effects of penicillin is a Type I Hypersensitivity reaction! (Bringing back bad memories)!Aminoglycosides have ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity! (Recall, they can cause damage to cranial nerve VIII)Glycopeptides can cause red man syndrome (a systemic erythematous rash) if given too quickly. This can be pretty severe!Antibiotic TreatmentA penicillin (eg. Cloxacillin), and an aminoglycoside (Tobramycin, Gentamicin) are generally used.If MRSA is suspected, then a glycopeptide like Vancomycin can be used as well.Complications of Infective EndocarditisLocal Destruction of the EndocardiumAn abcess can press on surrounding structures.Valvular regurgitation can occur.A fistula can form between two cardiac chambers.Cardiac arrythmiasSystemic EmbolizationIncreased risk of emboli falling off and going everywhere!Risk of stroke, ischemia, infarct, etc.Uncontrolled SepsisIndications for SurgeryGenerally, surgeons try to wait for the patient to stabilize and for the infection to absolve before performing an operation.But there are some cases where you proceed anyway:Any local destruction.Persistent or increasing vegetation size even with the appropriate ABX (antibiotic).Continuing septic emboli or ongoing sepsis.Refractory heart failureThe pulmonary valve isn&#8217;t as critical, so we can actually remove it completely and wait for the patient to stabilize.The aortic valve and mitral valve are more critical so they require immediate replacement!Bioprosthetic valves are preferred, because there&#8217;s a higher risk of endocarditis with mechanical valves! &#8594; better to have to replace it than risk having a repeat IE event.Surgical Treatment of IEValve removal if it&#8217;s the pulmonary valve.Valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve if it&#8217;s the mitral/aortic.Surgery is indicated if there&#8217;s structural damage, or heart failure. It&#8217;s also indicated if there&#8217;s increasing vegetation, or continuing sepsis/septic emboli, even with the right antibiotic!Case ExamplesCase 1Case Summary79 year old manBioprosthetic AVR earlier in yearPost operative diarrheal illnessWeight loss and temperaturesAltered bowel patternBlood cultures positive for listeriaHad infective endocarditis of the aortic valve.Prosthetic valve infective endocarditis is more risky, because repeat thoracotomies increase the risk of complications.ECG showed an extended PR segment, suggesting slowed conduction through the AV node. This suggests a first-degree heart block, and that suggests infection around the aortic valve.Case 2Case Summary67 year old ladyBioprosthetic AVR for aortic stenosisSeptic episode five months ago (cellulitis)Now presents with increasing dyspnea and peripheral edemaDyspnea and edema suggestive of both left and right-sided heart failure.CXR showed LV hypertrophy and evidence of pulmonary edema.Some minor aortic regurgitation was seen in diastole in her previous doppler ultrasound (this is pretty normal, and doesn&#8217;t present with symptoms).When she came in now, there was vegetation on the repaired valve, and heavy aortic regurgitation.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/22/endocarditis.html"},
	{"title": "Aortic Regurgitation", "text": "Aortic Regurgitation (AR): Regurgitation from the aortic valve.The etiology of AR could be two things:A valve leaflet problem.Dilation of the aortic root. &#8594; when the aortic root enlarges, it pulls the leaflets apart.Since the aortic valve closes during diastole, you shouldn&#8217;t have any backflow. In AS, you do have backflow, so you hear a diastolic murmur. This is just as we saw in the Clinical Assessment of Heart Sounds lecture.The most common cause of a valve leaflet problem is calcific degeneration of the aortic valve leaflets, or a congenital bicuspid aortic valve.Root enlargement of the aorta is the leading cause of AR in the western world that ends up leading to AVR (aortic valve repair). This is typically because of age-related degenerative enlargement.Recall that Marfan's disease is also a risk factor for Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease (MVP), because it weakens connective tissue. The same applies here!Marfan&#8217;s disease is also common &#8594; it raises the risk of all valvular regurgitation problems!The Etiology of ARAR can be caused by two things:1. A Leaflet ProblemCalcific DegenerationBicuspid Aortic ValveEndocarditisLupus (it&#8217;s always Lupus!)Calcific Degeneration and a Congenital Bicuspid Aortic Valve are the most likely causes.2. Aortic Root EnlargementThese are more common than a leaflet problem in the western world!Age-related degenerationHypertension &#8594; chronic hypertension can cause the aorta to dilate.Marfan&#8217;s Disease &#8594; can cause dilatation of the aortic root!Bicuspid aortic valve aortopathyAge-related Degeneration is the most likely cause of aortic root enlargement.Chronic Aortic RegurgitationHere, the aortic root is dilated, causing the three leaflets to spread apart.Note that the 3 cusps can&#8217;t completely appose each other, so the seal is leaky.The primary cause of this is ectasia of the aortic root &#8594; spreading of the valve annulusEctasia = dilation of a tubular structure.Usually this is idiopathic, but it can sometimes be caused by chronic hypertension!Since blood flows back from the aorta, the LV dilates &#8594; systolic heart failure over time!The hollow area in the center is actually a giant dilated aortic root!This is a doppler ultrasound that cuts the aortic valve transversely. Here we see that there&#39;s turbulent flow in the center of the valve, suggesting that the dilated aortic root has prevented it from closing properly.Functional Findings in Aortic RegurgitationVolume overload into the LV causes eccentric hypertrophy.Dilation of the LV increases the radius. Since wall-tension = (P &#215; R)/(2 &#215; Wall-thickness), as the radius increases, the wall stress does as well!Early on, systolic function is maintained because contractility can be increased with the increase in volume. But in late stages, we reach a breaking point, systolic heart failure begins to occur! (Recall the Frank-Starling Law of the Heart).The pulse pressure widens!The LV dilates &#8594; stroke volume &#8593;. Because of this, the heart pumps out a lot of blood during systole, causing an elevated systolic BP.But during diastole, because blood flows back into the LV through the insufficient aortic valve, the diastolic BP fallsAs a result, the PP = systolic - diastolic, increases!Look at how big that left ventricle is! Eccentric hypertrophy is obvious here. The echo showed that the systolic function was still maintained pretty well.Key Findings in Aortic RegurgitationDiastolic Murmur &#8594; high pitched, best heard at the base. (the aortic region)Widened pulse-pressure &#8594; increased contractility in response to increased volume causes the systolic to rise, and regurgitant flow from the aorta causes the diastolic to fall.Clinical Findings in Aortic RegurgitationDiastolic murmur: soft, high-pitched, and heart best along the 3rd ICS.It&#8217;s heard best at the end of expiration when leaning forward.The location where the murmur is heard best can help determine whether it&#8217;s a leaflet problem or a root abnormalityLeaflet abnormalities are heard best left of the sternum (near the pulmonic area).Root abnormalities are heard best right of the sternum (near the aortic arch).The length of the murmur correlates with severity &#8594; the longer it is, the more persistent the regurgitation! Assess murmur length by assessing whether it&#8217;s longer or shorter than half of diastoleThe loudness of the murmur does not correlate with severity, just as we had before.Because the LV dilates, sometimes we can feel a Left Ventricular Heave.Summary of Clinical FindingsDiastolic Murmur that is soft and high pitched, near the base.If heard best left of the sternum, it&#8217;s a leaflet abnormalityIf heart best right of the sternum, it&#8217;s a root abnormalityThe length of the murmur correlates with severity, but not the intensityThe Apex is displaced because of LV hypertrophy.An S4 can be heard because of LV hypertrophy.An S3 can be heard if there&#8217;s CHF causing a baggy ventricleSigns of a Widened Pulse PressureThere&#8217;s a whole gamut of interesting clinical signs with funny names that are a consequence of a widened pulse pressure.Quincke&#8217;s Sign: You can see the capillaries flush and blanch with each cardiac cycle!Muller&#8217;s Sign: Systolic pulsations of uvula.Duroziez&#8217;s Sign: The sign that is seen the most frequently!. There&#8217;s a bounding pulse in the femoral artery.When you compress it proximally, you hear a systolic murmur.When you compress it distally, you hear a diastolic murmur.Traube&#8217;s Sign: When you listen over the femoral artery, you hear something that sounds like a pistol shot.Corrigan&#8217;s Sign: A collapsing pulse. Can be felt at the carotid!Note, that as the LV begins to fail, the contractility will fall, and the systolic will fallCHF also causes an increase in sympathetic tone &#8594; systemic vasoconstriction &#8594; diastolic will increaseAs a result, the pulse pressure will fall!This means that once AR has progressed to cause CHF, these exam findings will start to disappear!The length of the murmur will remain a good clue to the severity of the AR.Pulse Pressure FindingsQuincke&#8217;s Sign: Alternating flushing and blanching of the capillaries in the nails.Muller&#8217;s Sign: Pulsation of the uvula with systole.Duroziez&#8217;s Sign: Most common. Bounding femoral pulse, where you hear a systolic murmur if compressed proximally, and a diastolic murmur if compressed distally.Traube&#8217;s Sign: &#8216;Pistol shots&#8217; when you listen over the femoral artery.Corrigan&#8217;s Sign: A collapsing pulse.When a patient progresses to CHF, the pulse pressure narrows again, so these findings disappear.Symptoms of Aortic RegurgitationLong asymptomatic period, because the heart can compensate for increased preload by jacking up contractility!Exertional dyspnea and fatigue are early signs, suggesting the LV has begun to fail.Once it gets worse, it can back up to the lungs &#8594; orthopnea, PND.Sometimes Angina can occur, because the aorta perfuses the coronary arteries during diastole.So if the diastolic is low, flow into the coronaries will fall, affecting perfusion.This, coupled with increased myocardial oxygen consumption because of LV hypertrophy, can result in angina.Diagnosing Aortic RegurgitationSame as with all the other valvular lesions.ECG &#8594; large R-wave in V5-V6 &amp; large S-wave in V1-V2 may suggest LV hypertrophy. Not too useful.CXR &#8594; large LV. Not too useful.Echocardiogram = diagnostic. Gets you lots of info!Treating Aortic RegurgitationSame as with all the other valvular lesions mostly.If asymptomatic &#8594; good prognosis, monitor.If symptomatic &#8594; endocarditis prophylaxis. No medications have been shown to improve survival. Surgery is indicated.This is a survival curve for patients with Aortic Regurgitation as well as CHF. CHF is grouped according to the New York Heart Association classifications (I, II, III-IV). Obviously, the more severe the heart failure, the worse the survival. But even if you have mild-moderate symptoms, the survival is bad enough that we should intervene!Hence, surgery is always done in symptomatic patients.We also sometimes operate on asymptomatic patients!This is because the patients do poorly once the LV already begins to fail!It&#8217;s better to have the surgery before their condition has progressed that far!Hence, we operate in asymptomatic patients if their LV starts failing or stretches significantly &#8594; LVEF &#60; 50% or LVESD &gt; 55 mmIf not, we monitor them frequently so we catch progression early!Indications for Surgery for ARSymptomaticAsymptomatic and LVEF &#60; 50% or LVESD &gt; 55 mmCompare this to Mitral Regurgitation, where the cutoffs are LVEF &#60; 60% or LVESD &gt; 40 mm.Surgical Therapy for Aortic RegurgitationDepends on the etiology:If it&#8217;s a leaflet problem &#8594; aortic valve replacement.If it&#8217;s a root problem &#8594; aortic valve sparing operation, where you fix the aortic root, but spare the valve itself. No need for a replacement!These surgical approaches will be covered on Friday.Acute Aortic RegurgitationThe most common causes of acute AR are:Endocarditis causes disruption of the valve leaflets.Aortic Dissection, where the dissection flap falls into the leaflets.Aortic Dissection = a tear in the aorta. There are 2 types.Type A = ascending aorta, surgical emergency.Type B = descending aorta, usually dealt with medically first. If things don&#8217;t stabilize, then surgeons are involved.Usually caused by hypertension.Because of the sudden onset, the heart doesn&#8217;t have time to compensate! Hence we have:A sudden drop in stroke volume &#8594; hypotensionA marked increase in LV pressure &#8594; LA &#8594; lungs &#8594; pulmonary edemaThere is a Short murmur, that may be inaudible, because of a rapid equalization of pressure due to severe valve damage.Here is a case of acute AR because of infective endocarditis.There&#8217;s actually a hole in one of the leaflets!Consequently, emergency surgery is usually indicated.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/22/aortic-regurgitation.html"},
	{"title": "Mitral Stenosis", "text": "Mitral Stenosis is pretty rare now in the developed world.This is because its etiology is Rheumatic fever in 99% of cases!Rheumatic Fever = Cross reactivity to antigens from GAS (Streptococcus pyogenes).Female preponderance (2/3)In the developing world, where it&#8217;s more common, there&#8217;s a short timespan between infection and valvular manifestations.In the western world, there&#8217;s a long asymptomatic period before valvular manifestations!Because of this, in Canada, mitral stenosis is usually only seen in the very old, or in immigrantsCharacteristics of Mitral StenosisThe leaflets themselves become thickened and calcified &#8594; the valve becomes slit-like.Where the anterior and posterior leaflets come together, there is a commissure.In MS, this commissure also becomes thickened, making it harder to open.The chordae tendinae also get thicker.The LA scars and dilates &#8594; predisposes the patient to atrial fibrillation.The aortic valve can also sometimes be affected with rheumatic fever!Rheumatic Fever25% have Mitral Stenosis only40% have both MR &amp; MS35% are multivalvular in any way.In general, Mitral Valve &#62;&#62; Aortic Valve &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; Tricuspid &#62; PulmonicFunctional Findings in Mitral StenosisThe Mitral Valve (4-6 cm2) is larger than the aortic valve (3-4 cm2).Pressure gradients start forming when the valve area falls below 2.5 cm2.Obviously, in Mitral Stenosis, the mitral valve is stiff.The consequences of this are fairly straightforward, and can be obtained logically:MS obstructs flow from the LA &#8594; LV.Hence the pressure and volume in the LA rises &#8594; backflow to lungs &#8594; RV afterload &#8593;Long term, this can cause RV failure because of backflow &#8594; tricuspid regurgitation, peripheral edema, ascites, liver congestion.This can also impede structures around the heart, for instance the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, since it wraps around the ligamentum arteriosum, a remnant of the ductus arteriosus (remember the anatomy lab!).Compression of the left laryngeal can cause hoarseness of the voice, because it innervates the larynx!Predisposition to atrial fibrillation because of LA dilation.Increases risk of stagnant blood flow in the atria!Increases risk of thromboembolic problems.An example of Mitral Stenosis with a massively dilated left atrium. Also note the scarring and calcifications seen with the mitral valve.Here is another example, where a mural (wall) thrombus has formed in the stagnant flow in the LA. Notice the dilation of the LA, and the scarring of the mitral valve.Symptoms of Mitral StenosisThe main symptoms are because of pulmonary hypertension and reduced cardiac output:FatigueExertional DyspneaIn women, symptoms typically present with pregnancy because of physiological demands for increased CO and HR.Later on, patients can also have symptoms of congestive heart failure like paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) and orthopneaParoxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea (PND) &#8594; When a patient is sleeping, and lying down, this increases preload in the heart, triggering CHF. This causes shortness of breath that wakes the patient up.Orthopnea &#8594; SOB when lying flat.Similarly, right sided heart failure symptoms like peripheral edema, congested liver, and ascites may occur.Hemoptysis can occur because of severe bronchial vein dilation due to jacked up pulmonary pressure.Hoarseness may occur because of compression of the left laryngeal nerve.Clinical Findings in Mitral StenosisAtrial Fibrillation because of LA enlargement.Mitral facies &#8594; in patients with severe MS, they can have a purple patch over their cheeks, due to vasoconstriction secondary to decreased cardiac output.Loud S1 &#8594; the valve is stenotic and enlarged, so when it closes, it makes a loud sound. Over time, this decreases because the valve becomes stiffer and less mobile.Loud S2 &#8594; because of pulmonary hypertension, the closing of the pulmonary valve (P2) is louder!Opening Snap &#8594; when the stenotic mitral valve &#8216;snaps&#8217; open. After which, you hear a murmur.The distace between A2 (closing of the aortic valve), and the OS (copening of the mitral valve) reflects how much pressure there is in the LA. The higher the pressure in the LA, the faster the OS happens!Diastolic murmur, best heard at the apex. Sounds a bit like a rumble.The larger the pressure gradient, the longer the murmur lasts. This is similar to aortic stenosis, where the later the peaking, the more severe it is!Summary of Clinical FindingsDiastolic murmur, best heard at apex. The longer the murmur, the more severe!Opening snapLoud S1 &amp; S2Atrial Fibrillation because of atrial distension.Mitral facies because of reduced CO distally.The shorter the distance between A2 and OS &#8594; the higher the LA pressure!The longer the murmur lasts after the OS &#8594; the more severe the stenosis!Here, you can see how the OS gets closer to A2 with increased severity, and the length of the murmur gets longer as well. When the Mitral Stenosis gets more severe, the LA pressure increases, causing an increased pressure gradient between the LA and LV once the valve opens.The pressure gradient between the LA and LV determines the length of the murmur. Note that this gradient increases as the MS gets more severe!Recall that Atrial Systole happens right before isovolumetric contraction. In this figure, atrial systole increases LA pressure, causing a pre-systolic accentuation of the murmur.Diagnosing Mitral StenosisECG &#8594; enlarged P-waves suggesting atrial enlargement.Unlike with Mitral Regurgitation and Aortic Stenosis, with Mitral Stenosis, a CXR is pretty useful!Can see left atrial enlargement.The double border sign &#8594; since the LA is behind the RA, you can see the borders of both when imaging the chest from the front, if the LA is enlarged.Straightening of the left heart border also occurs with LA dilation. As the LA gets bigger, it straightens out.Splaying of the carina &#8594; discussed before, when the splitting of the bronchi exceeds 90&#176;The double border sign, as well as straightening of the left heart border. The double border sign is somewhat hard to see in example A.As with the other valvular lesions, an Echocardiogram is diagnostic!Here is a good example of an echocardiogram for mitral stenosis.Note how enlarged the left atrium is.Also, observe how the valve looks less pliable, and stiffened.Sometimes, thrombi can be seen in the LA too, as well as signs of atrial fibrillation.Severity of Mitral StenosisAs with aortic stenosis, the severity increases when the pressure gradient increases or the valve area decreases.Gradients&#62; 5 mmHg (mild)5-10 mmHg (moderate)&#62; 10 mmHg (severe)Mitral Valve Area&#62; 1.5 cm2 (mild)1.0-1.5 cm2 (moderate)&#60; 1.0 cm2 (severe)Treating Mitral StenosisPharmacological treatment of Mitral Stenosis can include: 1. Treating potential Atrial Fibrillation. As we saw before, we can use: - &#946;-blockers - Digoxin - Non-DHP CCBs 2. Anticoagulate because of the risk of thromboembolic events.Again, if asymptomatic, we watch and wait. If symptomatic, surgery is indicated!This is basically the SAME as with Mitral Regurgitation!This makes sense &#8594; both can cause a dilated LA, so both raise the risk of thrombo-embolic events and atrial fibrillation.Surgical Therapy for Mitral StenosisSimilarly with Mitral Regurgitation, we DO look at Atrial Fibrillation, Pulmonary Hypertension, and the development of symptoms as indications for surgery.Unlike with Mitral Regurgitation, we DO NOT look at LVEF, and LVESD, because you don&#8217;t see dilation of the LV with mitral stenosis!There are 4 options we consider for MS repair:1. Closed CommissurotomyStill being done in developing countries because it&#8217;s inexpensive, and doesn&#8217;t require specialized equipment (no need to be on a bypass)An incision is made across the lateral aspect of the left chest, and the left lung is moved aside.The heart is still beating while the surgeon makes an incision across the left atrium.From here, the surgeon puts his finger into the mitral valve, splits it, and opens it up. What!?!It&#8217;s a blind procedure, requires a lot of skill, and obviously isn&#8217;t that great mortality wise.2. Open CommissurotomyDone on a bypassThe surgeon has time to directly visualize the mitral valve, incise the commissures, and debride the valve and the ancillary structures (chordae tendinae, papillary muscles).Not done much anymore (used to be done in the 70s - mid 90s) &#8594; we have better methods now.3. Mitral Valve ReplacementDone when balloon valvuloplasty and commissurotomy are not feasible.Again, we can opt for a mechanical valve (lasts forever, but requires anticoagulation), or a bioprosthetic valve (lasts up to 15 years, but there&#8217;s no need to anticoagulate).Along with valve replacement, 2 other operations are usually simultaneously performed.The left atrial appendage is usually also removed at the same time. This is where most blood clots form with atrial fibrillation, so this is removed to reduce the risk of blood clots forming.Something known as a MAZE procedure to try to restore sinus rhythm in the case of a patient with atrial fibrillation.2. Percutaneous Mitral Balloon ValvuloplastyThe best choice for Mitral Stenosis in most cases nowadays.Percutaneous access through the femoral artery and vein (you go up a leg!)Move the catheter through the IVC &#8594; RA. Then you cross the interatrial septum, and get to the LA.From there, they cross the mitral valve with the catheter, and blow up a balloon.This opens up the mitral valve and reduces the gradient across the valve during diastole!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/21/mitral-stenosis.html"},
	{"title": "Mitral Regurgitation", "text": "Anatomy of the Mitral ValveThere are two leaflets: a posterior leaflet, and an anterior leafletThese leaflets sit on a ring called an annulus, which goes around the valve.There is a chordae tendinae attached to each leaflet.This chordae tendinae then connects to two papillary muscles.An postero-medial muscle on the medial side, by the septum.An antero-lateral muscle on the lateral side, by the wall.To remember this, remember the LAMP acronym: Lateral, anterior, medial, posterior.Anything affecting any of these structures can affect the function of the mitral valve.Mitral annulusThe anterior and posterior leafletsThe chordae tendinaeThe papillary musclesThe LV itselfCauses of Chronic Mitral RegurgitationBecause many structures can be affected, chronic mitral regurgitation has a large differential:MVP = Myxomatous mitral valve disease &#8594; most common cause!Endocarditis &#8594; infection of the valve structures, which can cause destruction of the valve leaflets.Mitral annulur calcification &#8594; severe calcification of the mitral annulus can cause mitral regurgitation.Rheumatic mitral valve diseaseCardiomyopathy &#8594; any problem with the LV, which can affect the papillary muscles and chordae tendinae.Ischemic heart disease &#8594; can also affect structures in the LV or the mitral valve.CRIME AcronymCalcifications &amp; CardiomyopathyRheumatic mitral valve diseaseIschemic Heart DiseaseMyxomatous Mitral Valve DiseaseEndocarditisMyxomatous Mitral Valve DiseaseMyxomatous Mitral Valve Disease is also known as Barlow Syndrome, floppy valve disease, and mitral valve prolapse (MVP)Myxomatous degeneration = Progressive weakining of connective tissueIn MVP, the leaflets get weaker, and can collapse back into the LA.Female preponderance of 2:1 (vs. a Bicuspid Aortic Valve, which has a male preponderance)Most common cause of MR needing interventionIt can be genetic, and since it involves connective tissue degeneration, it can be associated with conditions like Marfan&#8217;s.The Mitral Valve in MVPThe top image on the right is a valve with MVPBelow it is a normal valve.The chordae tendinae are thickened in MVP, as are the leaflets.But even though they&#8217;re thickened, they&#8217;re soft and pliableThis is pretty counterintuitive! The valve is bigger and thicker, but also less effective.Because of this, they show redundancy, and hood or billow upwards.Functionally, this causes prolapse, which may also cause regurgitation.Echocardiograms of MVPHere you can see the prolapse of the mitral valve into the LA.It actually sort of &#8216;flops&#8217; back into the left atrium!Notice that the valve actually looks thicker than a normal valve.Even so, because of the weakening of the connective tissue, it&#8217;s less effective!There is also some obvious LA enlargement, because of backflow.Acute &amp; Chronic Mitral RegurgitationAcute Mitral Regurgitation can occur because of two reasons:Endocarditis causing severe valve destruction.Rupture of the papillary muscle/chordae tendinaeChronic Mitral Regurgitation is usually because of LV adaptation.The LV dilates over time because of increased preload.This volume overload is the problem.Chronic Mitral RegurgitationThe LV ejects into both the aorta and the LA because of leakiness of the mitral valve.Since the LA is lower pressure, in chronic MR, you have blood flowing back into the LA. &#8594; LA pressure &#8593;This increases preload.Systolic function is initially well maintained &#8594; the LVEF is above 65%However, over time, systolic function can start to fail!Backflow can go from LV &#8594; LA &#8594; pulmonary circulation &#8594; RV!So you can eventually actually get pulmonary symptoms and signs of right-sided failure!Atrial stretch can also sometimes cause atrial fibrillation!Clinical Findings in Chronic Mitral RegurgitationHolosystolic systolic murmur, best heard at the apexS3 because of a baggy LVPossible Displacement of the ApexHigh pitched blowing sound.Normal carotid upstroke (vs. the slow-rising pulse seen in Aortic Stenosis)In aortic stenosis you have a quiet A2. With chronic MR, you have a loud P2 because of pulmonary hypertension! This makes S2 louderCan be heard better with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position (lying on their side, facing left) &#8594; brings the heart closer to the surface.Mitral Regurgitation vs Aortic StenosisBoth have systolic murmursMR heard best at the apex, AS heard best at the base.MR has normal carotid upstroke, AS has pulsus parvus et tardus.MR has a holosystolic murmur, AS will have a murmur with rising and falling intensityMR has a loud S2 (loud P2), AS has a quiet S2 (quiet A2)MR can have an S3 because of a baggy LV, AS can have an S4 because of a thick LV.Diagnostic Tests for Chronic Mitral RegurgitationECG &#8594; not too helpful.Can show atrial fibrillation if they have it.Could also show atrial enlargement (elevated P-waves in the relevant leads)CXR &#8594; also not too helpful. Can show cardiomegaly and possibly LA enlargement.Again, the Echocardiogram is diagnostic! It tells us why the valve is leaking, what the pressures are, and the size and morphology!Management of Chronic MRUnlike aortic stenosis, medical therapy can be beneficial in the case of chronic MR.But surgical intervention is still what we aim for at the end.If the patient goes into atrial fibrillation:Anticoagulate because of static pools of blood in the atria.Slow down the ventricular rate. We can use:Beta-blockers (&#8216;lol&#8217; drugs. Want &#946;1-blocking function)Digoxin (Positive inotrope that &#8593; contractility and &#8595; HR)Calcium Channel Blockers (Non-DHPs, because you want the cardiac selective functionality. eg. Verapamil and Diltiazem)If the patient has severe MR, they should also take endocarditis prophylaxisThere isn&#8217;t much else we can do pharmacologically.As with aortic stenosis:If they&#8217;re asymptomatic, we watch and waitIf they&#8217;re symptomatic, they have a poor prognosis &#8594; surgery is indicated.The 3 bars show patients with Mitral Regurgitation, with differing ejection fractions. None had surgical intervention.Recall that a normal ejection fraction is &gt; 60%.In MR, the ejection fraction should be closer to 65% because we have a greater preload &#8594; greater contractility (Frank-Starling Law of the Heart).The figure shows that a lower EF is associated with worse outcomes in MR &#8594; it suggests failing of the LV.So the left ventricular function is key in determining prognosis with MR!Indication for SurgeryBecause of the above results, the LVEF is critical is determining whether surgery should be done!The indications for surgery are:Symptomatic (duh) &#8594; fatigue, weakness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, etc.Pulmonary HypertensionAtrial FibrillationLVEF &lt; 60% &#8594; if the LV is starting to failLVESD &gt; 40 mm &#8594; LVESD = Left Ventricular End Systolic DiameterThis is a little different than with Aortic Stenosis, where is was purely based on symptoms!SummarySurgery is indicated for chronic MR if:The patient has symptomsThe LV is starting to fail &#8594; LVEF &lt; 60%The LV is starting to dilate &#8594; LVESD &gt; 40 mmAlso pulmonary hypertension and atrial fibrillation, which may not necessarily present with symptoms.Surgery for Mitral RegurgitationIn the case of mitral valve prolapse, instead of doing a valve replacement, a valve repair can be done!This obviates the need for an artificial valve &#8594; no need for anticoagulation, and a decreased risk for endocarditis!Survival is also improved with repair versus replacement &#8594; presumably due to less disruption of the surrounding valve structure.Acute Mitral RegurgitationRecall that Acute Mitral Regurgitation can occur because of two reasons:Endocarditis causing severe valve destruction.Rupture of the papillary muscle/chordae tendinaeWhat will happen as a consequence?Stroke volume falls because some of the flow is going back into the LA.LA pressures increase rapidly &#8594; pulmonary system &#8594; pulmonary edemaThis pulmonary edema causes severe SOB.Because of a rapid equalization of pressures between the LA and LV, you actually hardly hear a murmur.A patient with acute mitral regurgitation. The cardiac silhouette is normal because the heart hasn&#39;t had time to compensate. The white fluffy stuff in the lungs is pulmonary edema. You can see an endotracheal tube as well, which was required because of his severe shortness of breath.Management of Acute Mitral RegurgitationSurgical intervention is required. If you do nothing, the mortality is effectively 100%.High mortality even with surgery, around 30-40%.In the case of acute endocarditis, surgery may not be required depending on the severity, and how much damage has occurred.The patient is usually sterilized and stabilized before surgery occurs if they have infective endocarditis.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/21/mitral-regurgitation.html"},

(eg. 1 mmHg) – Aortic sclerosis (&neq; Aortic Stenosis): Thickening/calcification of the aortic valve as we age, that doesn&#8217;t affect function.Almost 50% of patients have aortic sclerosis past the age of 85.Aortic StenosisAortic Stenosis (AS) is an obstruction to ejection of blood from the LV.There is an increased pressure gradient between the LV and aorta.Hence the LV has to generate higher pressures to eject blood from the LV &#8594; there&#8217;s higher afterload.This presents as a gap between the LV pressure and the aortic pressure before the aortic valve opens.The more severe the stenosis, the higher the gradient.Recall that we had that:Laplace&#8217;s LawTension needed to eject = (Pressure &#215; Radius)/(2 &#215; wall-thickness)Hence, when the pressure increases, there is an increase in the tension needed to eject!To drop it, we need to increase the wall thicknessRecall that diastolic heart failure is when the atria are pushing blood into a stiff ventricle that isn't compliant, reducing the ejection fractionInitially, this is great, because we can compensate for increased pressure.But long term, this is bad, because:As the ventricle gets thicker, it becomes less compliant &#8594; increased risk for diastolic dysfunctionThere&#8217;s increased oxygen demandThere&#8217;s decreased oxygen supply because high pressures affect the time during which the coronary arteries can perfuse!Hypertrophy in Aortic StenosisThis is a transverse section through both ventricles.Note that there is concentric hypertrophy for the LV.Look at how small the cavity is!The normal wall thickness is only 1.5 cm.Clinical Findings in Aortic StenosisSystolic MurmurAs we saw in the lecture on murmurs yesterday, this would be a systolic murmur at the base.It would also radiate to the carotid, and may present with an S4 heart sound.We would also only hear a single S2, and a sustained apex beatThe later the murmur peaks during systole, the more severe the aortic stenosis!This would mean that it takes more time for the LV to generate enough pressure to open the valve!The intensity of the murmur does not indicate the severity of the aortic stenosis!This was discussed previously! Consider a highly stenotic aortic valve, where the LV has started to fail and there is very little blood flow through the aortic valve.There would be very little turbulent flow &#8594; quiet murmur!So in this case, a quiet murmur could be severe!Quiet S2 Heart SoundThis was also discussed previously.With a stenotic aortic valve, it doesn&#8217;t close properly, so you only really hear P2 and not A2. Since you mainly have the pulmonary sound, S2 is quieter.Pulsus parvus et tardusAlso known as a slow-rising pulse.Where the pulse is weak (parvus) and late (tardus).This is because it takes time for the LV to generate enough pressure to open the valve, and flow is obstructed. Hence you have a late, weak pulse.Feel this at the carotid &#8594; remember that you assess character from the carotid because it&#8217;s more proximal to the heart than the radial pulse.LV heaveVersus the RV heave we saw last lecture with Tricuspid Regurgitation.Hear, you feel a strong apical impulse.The apex may be displaced because of LV hypertrophy.4th Heart Sound &#8594; Discussed before. Because of a stiff left ventricle, you hear a sound right after closure of the aortic valve, during diastolic filling.Key PointThe peaking of the murmur is the best diagnostic feature for the severity of aortic stenosis. The intensity is not correlated with severity!Main Clinical FindingsSystolic Murmur best felt at the baseWeak S2Pulsus parvus et tardus (Slow rising pulse)LV HeavePossible S4Diagnosing Aortic StenosisAn ECG is not diagnostic &#8594; not that useful, you may see LV hypertrophy, but that&#8217;s about it.An Echocardiogram is the gold standardWith an echo, you can look at valve gradients and function, morphology, etc.The peak gradient and the mean gradient are used. The higher these are, the more severe the AS! (makes sense)A doppler waveform across the aortic valve, showing the pressure gradient. The higher the pressure gradient, the more severe the aortic stenosis.Determining Aortic Stenosis SeverityAS gets more severe as the valve area falls or the pressure gradient rises.Valve areaNormal: 3.0-4.0 cm2Mild: &gt; 1.5 cm2Moderate: 1.0-1.5 cm2Severe: &lt; 1.0 cm2Critical: &lt; 0.6 cm2Pressure GradientsNormal: &lt; 5 mmHgMild: &lt; 25 mmHgModerate: 25-40 mmHgSevere: &gt; 40 mmHg1. Degenerative/Calcific Aortic StenosisThe etiology is unclear &#8594; we believe it&#8217;s because of some sort of inflammatory process.The pathophysiology is similar to atherosclerosis.Calcium deposition (arrows point towards nodular calcium deposits in the figure on the right)Calcifications show up as bright spots in an echo.Generally presents late in life &#8594; 60s - 80s.We previously thought it had the same etiology as coronary artery disease &#8594; we treated patients very aggressively, as with CAD, to try and improve outcomes. Didn&#8217;t seem to do anything!So treatment aimed at atherosclerotic regression have not been shown to be beneficial.Thus, so far, we have no beneficial treatment to prevent calcific/degenerative AS!2. Congenital Bicuspid Aortic ValveMost common congenital heart problem! &#8594; 1% of the population will have a bicuspid aortic valve.Male preponderancePresent in their 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s &#8594; younger than with calcific/degenerative AS! Rob was an example of this!About 1/3 of patients will present with aortic stenosis, 1/3 will present with aortic regurgitation, and 1/3 will have no clinical problems.A bicuspid aortic valve causes an abnormal aorta &#8594; dilation.In the example to the right, you also see calcifications with the bicuspid valve.Symptoms of Aortic StenosisThe progression of AS depends on the presence or absence of symptoms.If the patient is asymptomatic, survival is similar to the general population, with &lt; 1% transitioning to sudden cardiac death.If the patient is symptomatic, survival is much worse (Recall the Valvular Disease Case Presentation)If you&#8217;re symptomatic, there&#8217;s 10% chance of sudden cardiac death per year, and this is higher if you have CHF symptoms!The big symptoms can be remembered with the ASD acronymASD Acronym for Aortic StenosisAngina &#8594; 50% of patients die within 5 years of onsetSyncope &#8594; 50% of patients die within 3 years of onsetDyspnea &#8594; 50% of patiends die within 2 years of onset 10% risk of cardiac death per year if angina, higher if syncope, higher if dyspnea!When to treat?Treat them if they&#8217;re symptomatic!Don&#8217;t treat them if they&#8217;re asymptomatic!1. AnginaAngina pectoris: Chest pain due to ischemia of the heart muscle.May actually occur with normal coronary arteries.But perfusion may be affected because the time in systole is prolonged because it takes longer to develop sufficient pressure to open the aortic valve!Since the LV can&#8217;t be perfused during systole because of the high pressures, this can cause ischemia!Coronary perfusion also depends on the relative pressures in the aorta and the LVESV.Demand also increases because of increased muscle massHence, we have reduced supply and increased demand!2. SyncopeSyncope: Transient loss of consciousness.Typically during exertion.Normally during exercise there is some vasodilation but with AS the patient may not be able to increase SV to compensate &#8594; BP &#8595;!Could also be because of an induced arrythmia.Could also be because of a baroreceptor phenomena &#8594; LV contracting so hard that you stimulate a baroreflex (aortic arch?), causing a drop in HR &#8594; bradycardia.In truth, it&#8217;s probably a combination of all 3:Inability to &#8593;SV &#8594; BP&#8595;ArrythmiaBaroreceptor phenomena3. DyspneaDyspnea: Shortness of breath &#8594; Heart Failure.Multifactorial causes:Systolic dysfunction.Diastolic dysfunction.Pressure overload of the LV.Decreased coronary reserve.Treating Aortic StenosisAsymptomatic &#8594; monitor for symptom development. No clear benefit to medical intervention.Symptomatic &#8594; valve replacement indicatedThe graph on the right shows that survival increases significantly with a valve replacement, versus patients that do not.AS &#8594; Valve replacement!Aortic Valve ReplacementThere are two main operations that can be done:Bioprosthetic ValveValve cusps made of bovine or porcine pericardium, or cadaveric material.This biological material is sewn onto a synthetic frame.GOOD: Limited lifespan of 15 yearsBAD: No long-term anticoagulationMechanical ValveGOOD: Long life expectancyBAD: Requires oral anticoagulation for lifeThere is also Transcatheter Valve Implantation (TAVI) &#8594; covered on Friday!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/21/aortic-stenosis.html"},
	{"title": "Clinical Assessment of Heart Sounds", "text": "General ConceptsS1 = LUB = M1 &amp; T1S2 = DUB = A2 &amp; P2Murmurs can be described as:normal flow through abnormal cardiac structuresabnormal flow through normal cardiac structuresSystolic Murmur GradingStage I &#8594; Barely audible.Stage II &#8594; Audible.Stage III &#8594; Loud, but not palpable.Stage IV &#8594; Thrill present.Stage V &#8594; Audible when the stethoscope is tilted off the chest wall.Stage VI &#8594; Audible with the stethoscope off the chest wall.Diastolic Murmur GradingSame as with systolic murmurs, except without V &amp; VIThis is because diastolic murmurs are generally quieter, so you never get to V or VI in severity.Assessing Murmurs SystematicallyFollow the following steps:When: Find out when the murmur is happening (systolic, diastolic).You can use the patient&#8217;s pulse as a guide.Murmur with pulse = systolic, and vice versa.Where: Where do you hear it loudest?At the apex?At the border? (tricuspid region)At the base? (aortic/pulmonary)This will then narrow down the differential to three possibilitiesYou can see a chart outlining these possibilities here!The differentials all make sense depending on the anatomy of the heart!For instance, if it&#8217;s heart best at the apex, it&#8217;s probably something involving the mitral valve. If it&#8217;s heard best at the base, it probably involves the aorta, atria, or pulmonary arteries.1. Systolic Murmur at the BorderThe things on the differential are:Tricuspid RegurgitationVentricular Septal DefectHypertrophic CardiomyopathyDifferentiating FactorsIn tricuspid regurgitation, the murmur should increase with inspiration, since you have more blood in the right side of your heart, so the turbulent flow should increase!There is no change in a VSD or Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, because they involve both sides of the heart, or just the left side.In tricuspid regurgitation, you may also feel a heave, causing RV stretching.In a ventricular septal defect, you often feel a parasternal thrill, because of flow back into the RV.In hypertrophic myopathy, you&#8217;ll feel a triple apex beat, because of the folding of the walls of the LV onto themselves. This causes you to feel three taps against your finger when you palpate the apex.Example 1There is a systolic murmur at the border that does not change with inspiration. You palpate a parasternal thrill.Systolic murmur at the border = tricuspid regurgitation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or a VSD.Palpable parasternal thrill = VSD.Ventricular Septal Defect	Example 2There is a systolic murmur at the border of the heart that increases with inspiration. You palpate an RV heave.Tricuspid regurgitation:Changes with inspirationRV heave.Example 3There is a systolic murmur at the border of the heart that doesn&#8217;t change with inspiration. You palpate a triple apex beat.Hypertrophic CardiomyopathyNo change with inspiration.Triple apex beat.2. Systolic Murmur at the BaseThis is near the aorta and the pulmonary arteries. Hence, the cardiac things on the differential are:Aortic Stenosis &#8594; stiff aortic valve causes compensatory hypertrophy.Atrial Septal Defect &#8594; hole between the two atria causing backflow from the LA to the RA.Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy &#8594; excessive cardiac muscle growth that may obstruct LV flow.Differentiating FactorsRadiationIn aortic stenosis, the murmur typically radiates to the carotids, because the turbulent flow goes out the aorta.In an ASD, since it&#8217;s an abnormal connection in the heart, the flow doesn&#8217;t radiate anywhere!In Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you can usually hear the murmur at the border and the apex as well, since it involves the LV.Palpation of ApexYou&#8217;ll feel a sustained beat upon apex palpation in aortic stenosis because it takes more effort to eject blood through a stiff stenotic valve.ASDs have a normal apex, and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we have a triple apex beat, as discussed before.Character of S2In aortic stenosis, because the aortic valve doesn&#8217;t close or open properly, you can&#8217;t really hear A2, so you only hear P2 &#8594; single S2!In an ASD, there&#8217;s wide fixed S2, people still aren&#8217;t completely sure why!In hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, we have a normal S2.Extra sounds.You may hear an S4 in aortic stenosis because an S4 is caused by a stiff LV, and we may have compensatory hypertrophy.The same applies with Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy &#8594; you obviously have a thick LV here.Example 1There is a systolic murmur at the base that radiates to the border and apex. The S2 is normal. There is an S4. There is a triple apex beat.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy &#8594; the presence of the S4 narrows it down to aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the triple apex beat makes it definitive.Example 2There is systolic murmur at the base that does not radiate. The S2 is wide and fixed. The apex beat is normal. There are no extra sounds.Atrial Septal Defect &#8594; it doesn&#8217;t radiate, suggesting that it&#8217;s turbulent flow inside the heart only. The S2 is wide and fixed, which is also characteristic of an ASD.Atrial Septal Defect	Example 3There is a systolic murmur at the base that radiates to the carotid. The S2 is single. There is an S4. The apex beat is sustained.Aortic Stenosis &#8594; the sustained apex beat suggests pressure against a non-compliant valve. Radiation to the carotid and a single S2 (due to loss of sound from A2) reinforces things.3. Systolic Murmur at the ApexThe things on the differential are:Mitral Regurgitation (MR) &#8594; an incompetent mitral valve, where there&#8217;s backflow into the LA.MItral Valve Prolapse &#8594; is a less severe form of mitral regurgitation where there&#8217;s extra valve tissue. Here the mitral valve collapses backwards into the LA.Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy &#8594; excessive cardiac muscle growth that may obstruct LV flow, as seen before.Differentiating FactorsRadiationIn MR, it may radiate to the left axilla (left armpit), since that&#8217;s just the direction of the blood flow.You generally don&#8217;t have any radiation in mitral valve prolapseAs we saw before, you can usually hear Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at the base and border as well (you can hear it everywhere!)CharacterYou hear a holosystolic murmur with Mitral Regurgitation and Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Lasts the entire duration of systole!You hear a late pearking murmur with Mitral Valve Prolapse. This makes sense &#8594; the turbulent flow with Mitral Valve Prolapse is maximal near the end of systole, where the valve collapses on itself!Palpation of the ApexAs we saw before, we saw a triple apex beat in Hypertrophic cardiomyopathyThe apex is displaced with mitral regurgitation, because it causes dilation of the LA &amp; LV, causing the apex to shift laterally.In mitral valve prolapse, there is no change in volume, so the apex palpation is normalExtra SoundsYou may hear an S3 in MR, because of dilation of the LV due to regurgitant flow.As before, you may hear an S4 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, because the LV is thickened and stiff.You may hear a mid-systolic click in mitral valve prolapse because of collapse of the mitral valve partway through systole!Example 1There is a systolic murmur at the apex. It radiates to the axilla. It is holosystolic. There is an S3.Mitral Regurgitation &#8594; radiation to the axilla, and the presence of an S3 (baggy ventricle).Mitral Regurgitation with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (S3)	<source src='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/157117/Class%20References/12%20Apex%2C%20S3%20%26%20Holo%20Sys%20Mur%2C%20LLD%2C%20Bell.mp3' type='audio/mpeg' />Example 2There is a systolic murmur at the apex. It does not radiate. There is a mid-systolic click, followed by a late peaking murmur.Mitral Valve Prolapse &#8594; the mid-systolic click and the late peaking murmur are suggestive of the prolapse, and that fact that it doesn&#8217;t radiate, and isn&#8217;t holosystolic.Example 3There is a systolic murmur at the apex. It radiates to the base and the border. It is associated with an S4. It is holosystolic. The apex beat is triple.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy &#8594; the triple apex beat makes it obvious!4. Diastolic MurmursFor the diastolic murmurs, you would hear a murmur when you&#8217;d normally expect the valves to be closed/open.You expect the aortic valve to be closed during diastole. When it isn&#8217;t that&#8217;s aortic regurgitation.You also expect the mitral valve to be open* during diastole. When it isn&#8217;t, then you have mitral stenosis.So just consider what valves should be closed/open during diastole, and the conditions where they don&#8217;t match!The same applies for systolic murmurs!Differential DiagnosesAortic Regurgitation &#8594; backflow from the aortic valve.Mitral Stenosis &#8594; &#8216;sticky&#8217; mitral valve.Differentitating FactorsLocationAortic Regurgitation involves backflow from the aorta back into the LV, so it&#8217;s best heart at the border. (between the aorta and the apex)Mitral Stenosis affects filling of the LV, so you hear it best at the apex.CharacterHigh pitched in aortic regurgitation.Rumbly in mitral stenosis.Palpation of the ApexAortic Regurgitation can cause LV dilation &#8594; displaced apex.Mitral stenosis attenuates the flow into the LV, making it harder to fill the LV. This makes it difficult to palpate the apexExtra SoundsS3 in Aortic Regurgitation possibly, because it can cause ventricular dilation.An opening snap in mitral stenosis if it isn&#8217;t completely stenotic and opens abruptly.Example 1You hear a diastolic murmur. It is loudest at the apex and sounds like a rumble. It&#8217;s difficult to feel the apex beat. There is an opening snap.Mitral Stenosis &#8594; the key feature here is the opening snap, and the rumble-like pitch.Mitral Stenosis	Example 2You hear a diastolic murmur. It is loudest at the border and is high pitched. The apex beat is displaced. There is an S3.Aortic Regurgitation &#8594; S3 suggests a dilated ventricle, as well as the displaced apex. It&#8217;s diastolic, and high pitched too.Aortic Regurgitation	5. Pericardial RubYou hear a murmur in systole and diastoleYou hear a triphasic murmur!Generally gets louder at the border, and when you get the patient to hold their breath.Could be due to pericarditis.Heard this with Harvey!

	{"title": "Introduction to Heart Sounds", "text": "PhonocardiographyNo longer in routine use.It used to be used to help define the sounds emanating from the heart.Now, instead of using phonocardiography, we usually use an echocardiogram now, because it gives us more clinically useful information about cardiac structure and function!The Cardiac CycleS1 = closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves.S2 = closure of the aortic valve.The diagram is somewhat incorrect, because the aortic valve should close when the pressure in the aorta exceeds the pressure in the LV (unless there&#8217;s aortic stenosis or something).Auscultation of the HeartNormal Heart Sounds (S1, S2)Additional Heart Sounds (S3, S4)MurmursAny other sounds (ejection click, etc.)Sites for Cardiac AuscultationAortic Area = Left of the sternal anglePulmonary Area = Right of the sternal angleTricuspid Area = Lower-left sternal borderMitral Area/Apex = Fifth intercostal spaceRight sided murmurs are loudest during inspiration &#8594; breathing in causes a negative pressure, sucking blood into the heart from the cava. Because of interventricular interdependence, the more blood is in the right side, the harder it is for the left side to fill!Left sided murmurs are loudest during expiration &#8594; with less blood on the right side, it&#8217;s easier for the left side to fill! Also, the left side of the heart is anatomically posterior to the right, making it harder to hear.The First Heart Sound, S1Closure of the tricuspid (T1) and mitral (M1) valvesNormally they close together, so you don&#8217;t hear them separately.It&#8217;s the lub in lub-dub.You hear a louder M1 with mitral stenosis, because it&#8217;s stiffer.The Second Heart Sound, S2Closure of the aortic (A2) and pulmonary (P2) valvesSince the left side of the heart is higher pressure, the aortic valve closes a little faster than the pulmonary one &#8594; split S2So you can normally hear a split S2 in younger patients.How can we change the Split S2?Breathing in increases the amount of blood in the right side, relative to the left &#8594; takes even longer to pump the blood out &#8594; widening of the gap.Therefore, the split widens with inspiration.Pathologically wide splitting can occur in patients with way more blood on the right side of the heart than the left. Could be because of a septal defect!Normal S1, S2, Apex	Split S2, Pulmonic	Third Heart Sound	The Third Heart SoundFollows S2KEN-TUC-KYHappens right after closure of the aortic valve &#8594; because of rapid ventricular filling because of a baggy LV.Differential diagnosis with S3 is FIPPY:FIPPY AcronymFailure (left ventricular failure)Incompetence (mitral regurgitation causes backflow into LA &#8594; high pressure in LA &#8594; rapid rush of blood into LV once the mitral valve reopens)Pregnancy &#8594; increased blood volume in pregnancy gives you a physiological S3.Pericarditis &#8594; inflammation of the pericardium.YoungThe Fourth Heart SoundPrecedes S1TENN-E-SEEPhysiological basis &#8594; atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle.Differential diagnosis with S4 is SHITSHIT AcronymStenosis (Aortic Stenosis) &#8594; also forces LV hypertrophy to push open a non-compliant valve.Hypertension &#8594; causes LV hypertrophy, and stiffeningIschemia/Infarction &#8594; both cause fibrosis/stiffeningTamponade (Cardiac Tamponade) &#8594; pericardial effusion puts pressure on the heart.Ejection ClickClicking sound upon aortic valve opening.Can hear this with a bicuspid aortic valve for instanceSince this occurs with early systole, it can easily be confused with S4.Ejection Click	S4 Heart Sound	Opening SnapOpening snap heard upon opening of a stenotic mitral valve, with some residual mobilityThe mitral and tricuspid valves close in S1, so this happens after S2, before S1.So this is easily confused with S2/S3.You can never have an opening snap and a S3 together, because an opening snap is caused by stiff opening of the mitral valve, and S3 is caused by rapid flow in, which will cause rapid opening of the mitral valve.Opening Snap and Diastolic Murmur (Mitral Stenosis)	Heart MurmursMurmurs reflect either:Turbulent Flow through abnormal cardiac structures.Excessive flow through normal cardiac structures.A palpable murmur is called a thrill.Describing MurmursWhere is it heard loudest?Where does it radiate to?What phase of the cardiac cycle does it occur in?Character (pitch)Intensity/LoudnessCardiac Valves and MurmursValves can only open and closeIf a valve doesn&#8217;t open properly, it&#8217;ll cause a murmur when the valve should be open.If a valve doesn&#8217;t close properly, it&#8217;ll cause a murmur when the valve should be closed.Intensity of the MurmurA loud murmur isn&#8217;t necessarily a more severe one!In fact sometimes, the quieter the murmur is, the more significant it is clinically! For example:Small ventricular septal defects (VSDs). &#8594; because the pressure in the LV is much higher than in the RV, a VSD usually produces a loud murmur. But this is usually not very severe, because the hole is small!Critical aortic stenosis &#8594; Severe narrowing of the aorta means that not much blood is moving through &#8594; quiet murmur! But this just means that the stenosis is extremely serious!Hence, the loudness is not diagnostic for severity!Grading Murmur IntensitySystolic MurmursStage I &#8594; Barely audible.Stage II &#8594; Audible.Stage III &#8594; Loud, but not palpable.Stage IV &#8594; Thrill present.Stage V &#8594; Audible when the stethoscope is tilted off the chest wall.Stage VI &#8594; Audible with the stethoscope off the chest wall.Diastolic MurmursSame as with systolic murmurs, except without V &amp; VIThis is because diastolic murmurs are generally quieter, so you never get to V or VI in severity.Innocent MurmursInnocent murmurs can be caused by increased flow through normal cardiac structures. Some examples would include:ExercisePregnancyAnemiaHyperthyroidismThey&#8217;re usually soft, and systolic, and unaccompanied by other clinical signs of cardiac disease.Ejection Systolic MurmursSix ways you can hear an ejection systolic murmur is:Aortic StenosisLVOT Obstruction (Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy)Pulmonary StenosisAtrial Septal DefectAortic Regurgitation without StenosisFlow MurmurThe location of the murmur reflects the location of the turbulent-flow!Holosystolic/Pansystolic = All of systole.Think about when you would hear the turbulent flow considering the physiology of the heart!Aortic Regurgitation	You hear an early diastolic murmur.Aortic Regurgitation &amp; Stenosis	You hear a mid-systolic murmur as well as an early diastolic murmur.Mid-Systolic Ejection Murmur	", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/20/into-heart-sounds.html"},

You can see the arch of the aorta, the apex, and the cardiac silhouette. On the right side, you can sort of see the IVC and SVC in the silhouetteThis patient has left atrial enlargement. You see a straighter left heart border, compared to the previous example.In the example able, you can see that the carina, which splits into the left and right bronchus, splays at more than 90&#176;. This is called splaying of the carina, and it&#8217;s one sign of atrial enlargement.You can also see two shadows along the right heart border. The inner border is actually the right atrial border, while the outer shadow is the left atrium, which is normally tucked in behind the RA.This double heart border is another sign of left atrial enlargement.This is the same patient after surgery to correct the problem. You can see sternal wires in the CXR, where the patient was wired back together.Cardiac FluoroscopyCardiac fluoroscopy is basically a series of chest X-raysIt allows for real time imaging, so you can see the heart moving!But because you&#8217;re taking lots of images, there&#8217;s a higher radiation exposureThis is usually done in conjunction with other cardiac procedures. For instance, we usually inject the dye alongside catheterization to measure pressures.Angiography (fluoroscopy + contrast injection of the vessels) is the most invasive test that is usually done.Invasive Cardiac ImagingAdvantagesHigh temporal and spatial resolutionImaging may be combined with acquisition of other functional information e.g. cardiac hemodynamics, coronary pressure/flow assessmentReal timeConventionally considered as a gold standardIn some cases, it&#8217;s the only way we have to get the information we need.DisadvantagesInvasive, complication risksContrast loadIonizing radiation exposureLimited access to centres with catheterization facilitiesExamples of FluoroscopyHere is an example of cardiac fluoroscopy.Here, a pig-tail catheter is passed across the aortic valve, and is sitting in the LV.Contrast is injected, and the heart is imaged.An angiogram is basically fluoroscopy of blood vessels, where contrast is injected to make vessels more visible.We can confirm whether or not the heart is contracting properly.The image on the left is a coronary angiogram, looking at the coronary circulation.The left coronary artery starts with the left main stem, and splits into two branches, the left anterior descending, which goes towards the apex, and the circumflex artery, which is more &#8216;s-shaped&#8217;.EchocardiographyCardiac ultrasound.Non-invasive, has lots of advantages:AdvantagesNo ionizing radiation &#8594; better for the patient!Portable (bedside) technology &#8594; if the patient is hard to move, you can bring the ultrasound to them!Inexpensive &#8594; at least compared to a CT/MRI machine.Flexible techniqueHigh frame rateReal time imagingDisadvantagesNarrow imaging windowLow spatial resolutionExamples of 2D EchocardiographyYou can see the chambers of the heart.The LV is clearly thicker than the RV in this echocardiogram. You can also see the mitral valve opening and closing.Blood then exits through the aortic valve, which has three cusps (left, right, posterior &#8594; remember the anatomy lab).a bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital heart problem, which has a incidence of maybe 1/50 people!The camera can be moved to get different angles and perspectivesWhite regions in the ultrasound reflect calcifications.You can also take a transverse view of the chambers of the heart.Here is an echo of the left ventricleIf a patient had an infarct that affected the septum, you&#8217;d see no movement in the wall between the LV and RV, but the rest of the &#8216;donut&#8217; would be squeezing extra hard to compensate.Finally, you can angle the view window to take a 4-chamber view of the heart.You can see all the chambers of the heart, as well as function of the valves.Hence, an echo is useful for looking at morphology, function, and size.The closest part of the heart to the transducer is the apex here, which is around the 5th intercostal space.Doppler EchocardiographyRecall that the doppler effect is how pitch changes with relative velocities.We can use it to assess the velocity with which blood is moving.For instance, we can generate graphs showing flow velocities.Colour doppler gives you a more intuitive display of blood flow and tissue motion.By convention, blue = away from you, and red = towards youTo remember this, use BART &#8594; Blue Away, Red Towards.This lets you easily visually assess abnormal flow patterns caused by valvular disease or congenital abnormalities.Transesophageal EchocardiographyInstead of taking images from the front, you can pass an endoscope through the esophagus, and take images from inside the esophagus.This is good because the resolution improves because the sound waves are firing closer to the heart.This is useful when you need higher spatial resolution, eg. when you&#8217;re looking at the structure of the aortic valve.3D EchocardiographyTechnological advances allow for multiple individual viewpoints to be composited into a 3D image.Sometimes it can give you more information versus a 2D echocardiogram.For instance, it can give you fine-grained detail on the structure of a valve.Contrast EchocardiographyYou can add contrast when you&#8217;re taking an echocardiogram to improve the yield from an image.This is especially helpful when the image quality is poor or when you&#8217;re doing a stress test.Stress EchocardiographyStress Echocardiography is where you compare images at rest with images acquired during exercise of pharmacological stress.It can be useful for assessing MIs, determining the severity of a stenotic aortic valve, or looking at other defects that may present differently under stress.Nuclear Cardiology TechniquesSome examples include:Radionucleotide angiographyMyocardial perfusion scintigraphyPositron Emission Tomography These also use ionizing radiation.1. Radionucleotide AngiographyThis involves radiolabelled blood that&#8217;s injected into a patient. We know how much we injected, so we can look at how much of the blood is ejected, etc.This lets us get some idea of volumes and ejection fractions, which are normally difficult to acquire clinically.2. Myocardial Perfusion ScintigraphyMyocardial Perfusion Scinitgraphy involves injecting a perfusion agent which goes everywhere that blood goes. So if there&#8217;s no agent in a region, there&#8217;s no perfusion there!The ischemic cascade describes how symptoms and findings progress as ischemia progresses:ST-depression and Angina are late symptoms of ischemia.To get earlier diagnoses of ischemia, we need to use different tests!Myocardial Perfusion scans lets us assess perfusion abnormalities, which lets us diagnose ischemic changes earlier!SPECT (Single-photon emission computed tomography) is what&#8217;s usually used.Images taken at stress and at rest are compared.Stress can be exercise induced, or pharmacologically induced.eg. Dobutamine, which is a &#946;1-agonist that &#8593; HR, &#8593; contractility.When the stress test and rest images are compared:Fixed perfusion defects = MIInducible perfusion defects = IschemiaAdvantagesFunctional complement to anatomical imagingImproved detection rates for myocardial ischemia vs. conventional comparator (stress electrocardiogram)Diagnostic and prognostic information for coronary artery diseaseAssessment of myocardial viability (thallium)DisadvantagesIonizing radiationLimited sensitivity for single vessel diseaseDurationPatient discomfortExamples of Myocardial Perfusion ScanningA Normal ScanYou can take a transverse, lateral, or apex view of the heart. Each view is perpendicular to each other, so you get a good representation of the entire heart. What is seen here is mostly the LV, because it has the thickest musculature, and absorbs the most radiolabel.Perfusion is colour coded. Brighter = more perfusion, darker = less perfusion.This would be a normal perfusion scan.Normally, you can&#8217;t see the RV because the wall is much thinner, so the degree of radiolabel uptake is much smaller.A Past Myocardial InfarctionHere is an example of poorer isotope uptake, suggesting reduced perfusionThe above is an example of a case where we have reduced perfusion.You lose the &#8216;lifesaver&#8217; shape from the transverse view of the heart.You can also see the blue line of the RV in this case. This is because perfusion of the LV is decreased so much, that the RV perfusion can actually be seen!The stress-test images also show reduced perfusion &#8594; we have lowered perfusion in both the normal and at-stress conditions!Since there is low perfusion in both, this is suggestive of a past MI.This is from a patient who had a previous heart attack.Ischemic ChangesIn this example, you see a change in perfusion upon stress.The decreased perfusion upon stress suggests ischemia, and not a past MI.3. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)Although PET can be used to look at myocardial blood flow, it isn&#8217;t used much for it.It&#8217;s usually used to look for metabolically active tissue &#8594; whether there&#8217;s any salvageable tissue after an MI that could be recoverable after reperfusion.It&#8217;s the gold standard for detection of myocardial viability.Computed TomographyCT scans are easy for the head since it&#8217;s not moving.It&#8217;s somewhat harder for the heart.Because of this, we have to do cardiac gating.Cardiac Gating: You look at the ECG, and &#8216;gate&#8217; the image-acquisition based on the findings on the ECG. That is, you take pictures at certain points of each cardiac cycle!The images at each point in the cycle are then combined.You would use a CT scan in cases where you want to look at structures that would not be visible with other scans.Also used a lot for CT angiography.Advantages:Non-invasiveHigh resolution imaging technique &#8594; you get much more spatial resolution!Disadvantages:Ionizing radiation applied widelyContrast administration &#8594; some people are allergic.CT Coronary AngiographyRather than injecting contrast via a catheter, we can just inject CT contrast into the arm instead.It&#8217;s become increasingly common as a technique over the past 10 years.Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance ImagingMRIs are a fantastic test because they don&#8217;t involve radiation, and give you great images.In the past, it was a difficult test to perform for the heart because the heart would move.You also can&#8217;t put anything magnetic into the scanners, and most older cardiac monitors had some degree of magnetic interference.Advantages:No ionizing radiationHigh spatial resolutionImproving temporal resolutionFlexible technique with potential for characterization of cardiac structures to a high degree of precisionDisadvantages:Really expensive!Specialized equipmentExperienced staffContraindicated for some patients (defibrillators, claustrophobia, etc)Patient discomfort &amp; long acquisition timeContrast administration for some applicationsExamples of MRIsYou can even use MRIs to compute 3D images of the heart! Neat!General Guidelines to ImagingGenerally, we start with non-invasive imagingChest X-RayEchocardiogramSubsequent investigations depend on the clinical situation.Invasive tests are required for pre-operative assessment, in cases where there are discrepancies between non-invasive imaging modalities, or to perform some sort of procedure (eg. a CABG)For specific tests, if you want to look at:Chamber size and global functionEchocardiogramNuclear Medicine TestsCT ScanMRIThe ValvesEchocardiogram (2D, Doppler)FluoroscopyThe Coronary ArteriesAnatomical Imaging &#8594; CT &amp; MRIFunctional Imaging &#8594; Nuclear (SPECT), MRIViability &#8594; Nuclear (SPECT/PET), MRI", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/20/imaging-cardiovascular-disease.html"},
	{"title": "Valvular Heart Disease Cases", "text": "Case of the WeekRob, worked for a company that sold surgical supplies. Played collegiate hockey.Physically active, 34 y/o.Diagnosed with an innocent murmur when he was a child.Dyspnea, SOB, and heart pounding playing hockey.Father had heart valve surgery in his fifties. &#8594; FHx of valvular heart disease.Abnormal carotid and apical pulse.Listened to his chest, found a heart murmur!Long crescendo systolic murmur (Grade III/VI)Long decrescendo diastolic murmur (Grade II/VI)Took an ECG and Echocardiogram.Rob chatted informally with a few surgeons &#8594; made him panic!Grade III Murmur = Put stethoscope on chest, hear it immediatelyGrade II Murmur = Will take a few cardiac cycles to hear it.Murmurs are caused by turbulent blood flowIncreased blood flow through a normal valveCould be an innocent murmur: eg. Pregnant women can have increased blood flowChildren can also have an innocent murmur because of increased sympathetic tone causing increased flow.Normal flow through a narrowed valve (stenosis)Aortic stenosis, for instance.Carotid bruits because of atherosclerosis.Abnormal flow because of valve leaksMitral regurgitationTricuspid regurgitationAortic regugitationRob&#8217;s ECG FindingsElevated QRS suggests LV hypertrophy.The easiest criteria for LV hypertrophy is V6. If the R-wave in Q6 is greater than 25 mm (2.5 mV), then it&#8217;s LV hypertrophy.Another criteria is R-wave &gt; 11mm in aVL.We also see an inversion of the T-wave suggesting a repolarization abnormality.V2 &amp; V3 show ST-elevation, and a little bit in V1.This is in keeping with an MI/pericarditis.Also see repolarization abnormalities in I &amp; aVL.Summary: LV hypertrophy with signs of a repolarization abnormality.Seemed to be much worse than the innocent murmur he was diagnosed with in childhood.DifferentialDifferential for LV hypertrophy in a 34 y/o male?Valvular heart disease is possible, but not the most common!Hypertension would be the most likely diagnosis, if there was an accompanying high BP, and the patient was older.But since they&#8217;re a 34 year old, this is more worrisome.What about Athlete&#8217;s Heart? Also presents with elevated QRS because of physiological LV hypertrophy.But this usually presents with mild/moderate hypertrophy, which wouldn&#8217;t cause this severe an ECG!But Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy would be a big worry in an athlete with an ECG like this &#8594; biggest cause of athletes spontaneously dying because of cardiac problems. eg. Len BiasSummary: Hypertension, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, &amp; Valvular Heart Disease are the big 3 possibilities in the differential.Hypertension is easy to diagnose.Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Valvular Heart Disease would be more difficult to diagnose, and would require imaging &#8594; Echo-cardiogram to look at morphology!CT/MRI could also be done for more intricate imaging.Chest X-Ray could also be used to help diagnose an enlarged heart from the cardiac silhouette.Echocardiogram FindingsPosterior wall and septum seem to be moving &#8594; heart function seems to be normal.The walls of the LV seem to be thickened. (upper limit of normal = 12 mm). Rob had a measurement of 13-14 mm &#8594; mild concentric LV hypertrophy.Mitral valve looked good.Aortic valve looked mildly calcified &#8594; saw white regions in the valve. But it looks like it&#8217;s opening and closing properly.The size of the aorta looks relatively okay too.From another five-chamber view, we see backflow from the aortic valve. Classified as moderate/severe regurgitation.This suggests aortic insufficiency/regurgitation!The aortic regurgitation accounts for the diastolic murmur (flow backwards after the closing of the aortic valve because of improper closure).So we know Rob has an abnormal leaky aortic valve, so far.ConsiderationsThe patient is very active, and wants to remain active.Rob would be a candidate for valvular surgery because he&#8217;s symptomatic (Exertional dyspnea, palpitations).Percutaneous procedure &#8594; goes through a blood vessel. In this case, since Rob is young, healthy, and has no contra-indications, there&#8217;s no need to do a percutaneous procedure over an open procedure.The pathognomonic cardiac symptoms are exertional dyspnea, palpitations, in conjunction with presyncope or syncope.Because Rob had symptoms, a valve replacement was indicated.But before you perform it, you have to make sure there&#8217;s no other pathology, because a repeat open heart surgery involving a sternotomy has a much higher risk of complicationsSo to check coronary circulation, you would do a coronary angiogram, to look for narrowings and signs of coronary artery disease.That way, if there&#8217;s need for a bypass, we can do that at the same time as the valve replacement!You also have to tell Rob to cut back on strenuous physical exercise, at least until the surgery. He could develop palpitations that lead to a fatal arrythmia, or ischemia!The Coronary AngiogramPut a catheter into the right femoral artery, through the abdominal aorta.Inject dye, and look at the coronary arteries.Also measure the pressures in the heart versus the systemic circulationLV pressure is around 240, and his aortic pressure was around 160. Hence the gradient across the valve was 80 mmHg!This means that the ventricle has to work a lot harder to eject fluid!This would be aortic stenosis!What valvular pathology would cause aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis in a young patient? A congenital Bicuspid Aortic Valve! The most common form of congenital heart disease. Risk is approximately 10-20% with affected parent/sibling.A normal aortic valve has three cusps. A bicuspid one only has 2. Over time, this morphology predisposes the patient to stenosis, and it can&#8217;t close perfectly.Aortic StenosisAortic stenosis has a median survival time after the onset of angina of only 5 years. If you present with syncope, it&#8217;s only 3 years. With CHF, it&#8217;s only 2 years!So if you&#8217;re presenting with any of these symptoms, it&#8217;d be a good time to get that valve fixed!What kind of valve should he get, and why?He can either get a bioprosthetic valve, or a mechanical valve.Bioprosthetic valves are good, but generally only last for around 10 years, before they need to be replaced. Hence they&#8217;d be good with older patients, where they probably won&#8217;t live those 10 more years.Mechanical valves last forever, but require anticoagulation afterwards!You can sometimes actually hear the clicking of the mechanical valve! Pretty neat.If you have a mechanical valve, you need long term warfarin anticoagulation. With a bioprosthetic, you just need low dose ASA.In Rob&#8217;s case, since he&#8217;s young, you would suggest the mechanical valve!The only problem is that the anticoagulation makes him more prone for bleeding! Hockey might not be the greatest pastime in that case.He would not be able to participate in any contact sports.So if he was a professional hockey player, for instance, he would go for the bioprosthetic, because it would allow him to continue with his contact sports.Warfarin requires constant monitoring of INRs, to ensure it&#8217;s staying within the therapeutic window.Too much clotting could cause thrombi to form, which can break off &#8594; embolus. Too little clotting, and you&#8217;ll have excessive bleeding.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/20/valvular-heart-disease-cases.html"},
	{"title": "Cardiovascular Pharmacology II", "text": "NitrodilatorsOrganic nitrates &#8594; NitroglycerinNitroprusside (eg. Sodium Nitroprussed)Intravenous drug that causes the release of nitric oxideArterial vasodilator.Nitric OxideRecall, that this was the Endiothelium Derived Relaxing FactorIt&#8217;s a potent vasodilator.All the nitrodilators work by producing nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator.They cause vascular smooth muscle relaxationNitroglycerin was originally used to make dynamite! Made Alfred Nobel rich &#8594; founded the Nobel Prizes.Nitric oxide functions by activating guanylate cyclase &#8594; cGMP.The cGMP then directly causes the vascular relaxation.Effects of NitratesVasodilationNitrates cause arterial and venous dilation. This decreases preload &#8594; reduces ventricular stretch!Coronary artery dilationCan be useful in patients with coronary artery disease, and the patients are ischemic.Will improve perfusion to the endocardiumReduces Myocardial Oxygen DemandDecreases preload because of vasodilation &#8594; decreases wall stress.Decreased BP also decreases afterload.Reduced wall stress may also improve ventricular perfusion, because high ventricular pressures reduce coronary circulation!Hence nitrates effectively reduce oxygen demand and improve oxygen supply.CaveatNitrates could potentially make myocardial oxygen supply worse, or make oxygen demand higherHow could this happen?If patients are hypotensive because of the vasodilation, you went to far, and coronary perfusion would actually drop!Could trigger the baroreflex because of a drop in blood pressure, causing an increase in heart rate. This can cause a reflex tachycardia which increases oxygen consumption!Nitrate ToleranceOver time, there is a loss of the hemodynamic and anti-anginal effects of nitrates.People develop a resistance to nitrates during long-term use or from frequent dosing.There are multiple hypotheses as to why this happens, but no definitive mechanism.The tolerance develops pretty quickly (over 24-48 hours)Hence, you have to be careful with IV nitroglycerin, or around-the-clock dosing.We require a nitro free interval (around 8-10 hours) during dosing to avoid tolerance!!Adverse EffectsHeadache (due to vasodilation in the head)Decreased blood pressure (obviously)Withdrawal Symptoms &#8594; rebound vasoconstriction could cause weekend angina/ weekend coronary events. But you shouldn&#8217;t see this if you dose properly.ContraindicationsAn example of a Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor would be Viagra (Sildenafil), which inhibits cGMP breakdown to increase vasodilation in the penis.Hypotension &#8594; obviously, since nitrates reduce BP!Ingestion of PDE-5 inhibitor:PDE5I = Phosphodiesterase-5-InhibitorPDE-5 inhibitor &#8594; inhibits the breakdown of cGMP.Since nitrates stimulate cGMP production, using these in conjunction can cause an accumulation of cGMP.This can cause hypotension.Hence, we need a 24-48 hour gap between dosing the two, depending on the half-life of the PDE5I.SummaryNitrates are used in patients with Myocardial ischemiaThe rationale for their role in treating angina is:Increasing oxygen delivery &#8594; vasodilating coronary arteriesDecreasing oxygen demand &#8594; vasodilation to reduce preload and afterloadCalcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)Effectively, there are two major classes of calcium channel blockers.Mechanistically, they function very differently. You sort of have to think of them like two different groups of drugs.The two classes have different indications, contraindications, and effects!They are as follows:Dihydropyridines (DHPs) (The &#8217;___ pine&#8217; drugs)eg. nifedipine, amlodipine.Primarily have a vasodilation effect &#8594; hence typically used with hypertension.Nondihydropyridines (Non-DHPs)VerapamilDiltiazemHave a vasodilator effect as well, but also act on the Sinus and AV nodeHence they reduce HR and contractility as well!Hence nondihyropyridines are similar to dihydropyridines, but do more stuff!Mechanism of ActionCalcium Channel Blockers function by binding to calcium channels.Will vasodilate smooth muscleDecrease myocyte contractilityDecreases conduction through the AV node to slow heart rate, similarly to Digoxin.Cardiac vs. Vascular SelectivityDihydropyridines like Amlodipine and Nifedipine are more vascularly selective, so they are primarily used to treat hypertension.Nondihydropyridines like Verapamil and Diltiazem have a much larger role in affecting the SA and AV notes, so they&#8217;re more cardiac selective, and will be used with atrial fibrillation, for instance.Because of these ancillary effects, nondihydropyridines are rarely used for hypertension. Also, because they reduce contractility, they&#8217;re also probably not a good idea in patients with CHF.IndicationsDHPs can be used for hypertension.AnginaAtrial Fibrillation rate control (Non-DHPs like Verapamil and Diltiazem). Dihydropyridines can&#8217;t be used here!Adverse EffectsHypotension &#8594; vasodilationFlushing and Headache &#8594; vasodilationSince Verapamil and Diltiazem affect AV condution like Digoxin, they can cause:Heart blockBradycardiaDecreased cardiac outputContraindications for DHPsBecause they&#8217;re basically vasodilators, they&#8217;re contraindicated in patients with low blood pressure.Aortic Stenosis is a relative contraindication &#8594; you don&#8217;t want to drop BP too much with a sticky aortic valve, because it increases afterload, so you need some more outward pressure.CCBs have also been shown to not improve outcomes in patients with CHF!Contraindications for Non-DHPsPatients with a slow heart rate.Patients with a low blood pressure.Patients with systolic failure.Basically, whenever the patient already has the effects of the CCB, such as a slowed HR, a low BP, or weakened contractility, worsening the effect is obviously a bad idea!SummaryCalcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) are split into two classes:Dihydropyridines (DHPs) &#8594; &#8217;___ pine&#8217; drugs like Nifedipine and Amlodipine. Mainly have a vasodilatory effect.Nondihydropyridines (Non-DHPs) &#8594; Verapamil and Diltiazem, mainly used because of their effect on AV conduction. Lowers heart rate and reduces contractility. Typically used in patients with atrial fibrillation. Not used with CHF!Beta BlockersOrganization of the Central Nervous SystemRecall that the Central Nervous System was organized as follows:Afferent signals go in, and efferent signals can be either autonomic or somatic.The autonomic nervous system is split into:The Sympathetic Nervous System &#8594; Rapid, fight or flight response.Dilation of the pupils &#8594; far vision.Decrease of secretions and peristalsis.Increased sweating.Dilation of the bronchi.Increase of the Heart Rate &#8594; due to increased conduction through the AV nodeIncreased heart contractility.Vasoconstriction while increasing flow to the muscles.Glycogenolysis &#8594; increased breakdown of glycogen to glucose which can be quickly consumed for energy.Piloerection &#8594; Hair standing on end!The Parasympathetic Nervous SystemThe Enteric Nervous SystemThe Sympathetic Nervous SystemThe SNS is thoracolumbar: Enervation moves from brain &#8594; spinal cord &#8594; thoracolumbar area &#8594; end organs.The neurotransmitters involved are catecholamines &#8594; Catecholamines have a catechol ring plus an amine group &#8594; Catechol + amine!The catecholamines that are involved are:Norepinephrine/noradrenaline at adrenergic nerve terminalsEpinephrine from the adrenal medullaHence, we have hormonal stimulation via epinephrine, as well as stimulation at the nerve terminals via norepinephrine.Adrenergic Receptor SubtypesG-Protein Coupled Receptors are involved in receiving Adrenergic signals. (ha, you thought you wouldn&#8217;t ever see them again huh.)There are 3 types of receptors involved:Alpha ReceptorsBeta ReceptorsBeta 1 ReceptorsIncrease cardiac contractility.Increase heart rate.Increase electrical conduction.Beta 2 Receptors It was previously mentioned that the SNS response causes vasoconstriction, except for the muscles, where vasodilation occurs to increase flow. This vasodilation of the skeletal muscle is mediated by the Beta 2 ReceptorsVasodilation &#8594; particularly of the skeletal muscle.BronchodilationGlycogenolysis &#8594; Production of glucose by breaking down glycogen.Beta 3 Receptors &#8594; we don&#8217;t know much about these, and we have no drugs that affect them, so we ignore them!Dopamine ReceptorsDopamine receptors will not be talked about much &#8594; they&#8217;re mostly in the brain and kidney.Problems with dopamine in the brain &#8594; Parkinson&#8217;s Disease.SummaryGPCRs involved in adrenergic systems include alpha, beta, and dopamine receptors.Of the beta receptors, the main classes we focus on are beta 1 receptors and beta 2 receptorsBeta 1 Receptors generally affect heart rate, contractility, and electrical conduction &#8594; affects the heart!Beta 2 Receptors cause skeletal muscle vasodilation, bronchodilation, and glycogenolysis &#8594; have a systemic effect.Beta Blocker TherapyIf we block the beta-1 receptors:Decrease in cardiac contractilityDecrease in heart rateDecrease in conduction through the SA and AV nodesIf we block the beta-2 receptors:VasodilationMay have some bronchoconstrictionNo glycogenolysisThis is pretty obvious.Hence, beta-blockers can be used for:Antihypertensives &#8594; drop cardiac output by decreasing flow.Post MI &#8594; by decreasing HR and decreasing contractility, we decrease oxygen demand and stress on the heart. But on the other hand, we don&#8217;t want to go too far and lower the CO too much in an acute situation.Congestive Heart Failure &#8594; this is actually a surprise &#8594; wouldn&#8217;t it be a bad idea to reduce cardiac output?! The reason why it&#8217;s used is because it seems as if prolonged activation of the SNS over time seems to worsen the condition of the heart!MigraineTremorsThyrotoxicosis &#8594; also known as a thyroid storm, associated with a high sympathetic tone.Adverse EffectsThe adverse effects of beta-blockers are immediately intuitive from their physiological mechanism:BradycardiaWorsening of heart failure if we drop the patient&#8217;s cardiac output too much.Can cause bronchoconstriction &#8594; bad in asthmatics.FatigueNightmaresMay mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia &#8594; risky in diabetics! When patients have hypoglycemia, the body responds by sweating, elevation in the HR, tremors, etc. But with beta-blockers, this response may be masked!Interestingly, beta-blockers with beta-2 activity can actually worsen symptoms in patients with peripheral vascular disease.This is because they would cause skeletal muscle vasoconstriction, exacerbating ischemia to the limbs. This could result in more severe claudications when walking.Classes of Beta Blockers&#946;-blockers are &#8217;___ lol&#8217; drugs. (Propanolol, metoprolol, etc.)Non-selective Beta Blockerseg. propranolol (Inderal&#169;)Propranolol blocks both beta 1 and beta 2 receptors &#8594; non-selective!Propranolol requires a large PO dose because it&#8217;s metabolized in the liver with a first-pass effect when given orally. Requires a much larger PO dose than an IV one.Used in patients with portal hypertension &amp; GI bleeding. (will see this next year)Also has lots of side-effects.Cardioselective Beta Blockerseg. MetoprololMuch larger effect on the heart-related Beta 1 function versus the Beta 2 function!beta 1 block &gt; beta 2Also has a first-pass hepatic metabolism.Indicated in all patients post MI, and with systolic heart failure.Third Generation Beta Blockerseg. Carvedilol (Coreg&#169;), labetalolNon-selective beta blocker (blocks beta 1 &amp; beta 2)Also has an alpha 1 blocking effect&#945;-receptors cause vasoconstrictionShown to increase survival in heart failure (COMET trial comparing metoprolol &amp; carvedilol &#8594; cardioselective &#946;-blocker vs. third-gen &#946;-blocker)Why do Beta Adrenergic Blockers have Beneficial Effects?There are lots of potential reasons as to why &#946;-blockers can be beneficial:Inhibition of the cardiotoxicity of catecholamines &#8594; if catecholamines constantly bombard the heart, it can be toxic over time!For instance, in patients with a bleed in the head (a subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is a massive acute catecholamine release, which can cause acute myocardial dysfunction, and a marked low ejection fraction, which is thought to be due to acute catecholamine toxicity.Decrease in HR may reduce strain on the heart.Antihypertensive, antianginal, antiarrhytmic.Relative ContraindicationsFollow from the physiology: low BP, low HR, clinically unstable, reactive airway disease like asthmaCatecholamines and Survival with Heart FailureIn heart failure, a number of compensatory responses are turned on &#8594; activation of the RAAS system, increased sympathetic tone.Increased circulating catecholamines have been seen to decrease long-term survival!In the figure on the right PNE = Plasma Norepinephrine LevelsHence, we have improved mortality in systolic heart failure if we start blocking these compensatory responses!Blocking the RAAS with an ACEI/ARB, and an Aldosterone antagonist.Blocking the sympathetic response with &#946;-blockersSummary&#946;-blocker medications can be split into 3 groups:Non-selective &#946;-blockers &#8594; &#946;-1 &amp; &#946;-2;. eg. propanololCardioselective &#946;-blockers &#8594; &#946;-1 &gt; &#946;-2. eg. metoprololThird-generation &#946;-blockers &#8594; &#946;-1, &#946;-2, &amp; &#945;-1. eg. carvedilol, labetalol&#945;-1 receptors are involved in vasoconstriction (aside from the skeletal muscles, which are vasodilated by &#946;-2 receptors).ConclusionsNote that there is a lot of overlap between medications!For instance, digoxin, Non-DHP CCBs like Verapamil and Diltiazem, and &#946;-blockers could all be used to treat atrial fibrillation!The one you would use would depend on the patient and their contraindications!eg. You would use digoxin if it was an old, sedentary patient, because the effect on the PSNS is mild and the fact that it&#8217;s easily overcome by exercise isn&#8217;t such a big deal if the patient isn&#8217;t very active.If the patient was younger, Verapamil might be better (except if they have CHF, because the vasodilatory effect may worsen morbidity and mortality)Notes for the lecture can be found in these summary notes.There is also a spreadsheet summarizing the context in which you&#8217;d use each drug!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/17/intro-cardiovascular-pharmacology-2.html"},

Angiotensinogen is produced in the liver.Angiotensin I is converted to Angiotensin II by the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE).Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, and it also acts on the adrenal cortex, and triggers aldosterone release.The Angiotensin Converting EnzymeConverts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin IIAngiotensin II mediates aldosterone secretion and vasoconstriction, as described previouslyIt also has other effects, like hypertrophy, remodeling, and fibrosis of the myocardiumIt also increases fluid leakage from the kidneysIt also causes vasoconstriction of kidney arteriolesConverts Bradykinin to inactive peptideRecall that bradykinin is an involved in the inflammatory process, and is involved in vasodilation and the perception of painNote that in the diagram, all the drugs we have act on the Angiotensin 1 receptor. There are other types of receptors that we don&#8217;t have drugs for.The Angiotensin 1 Receptor downstream of Angiotensin II mediates:Vasoconstriction&#8593; Aldosterone &#8594; Na+, H2O retention.&#8593; Sympathetic ActivityNote that since ACE inhibitors are more upstream along the RAAS pathway, they also affect the conversion of bradykinin to inactive metabolitesConsequently, ACE inhibitors also increase bradykinin levels in the body.ACE InhibitorsACE inhibitors generally are ___ pril drugsSome examples include:CaptoprilEnalaprilRamiprilQuinaprilLisinoprilPerindoprilTrandolapril&#8230; and more!As we said before, they block the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme that converts Angiotensin I &#8594; Angiotensin IIConsequently, we have increased angiotensin I, and decreased angiotensin IIAs a consequence of having less Angiotensin II, we have:Vasodilation, therefore decreased blood pressure. Since Angiotensin itself is a Vasoconstrictor!Decreased aldosterone release, increasing fluid loss from the kidneys.Downregulation of the sympathetic nervous systemAn effect on remodeling/hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis.Bradykinin formation is also increased. Bradykinin itself is also a vasodilator.Basically, ACE inhibitors prevent the BP maintaining effects of the RAAS system, allowing it to fall.Indications for ACE InhibitorsHypertension, as it is an antihypertensiveSystolic Heart Failure of all stages, as it not only reduces pressure, and hence wall tension in the LV, but it also helps prevent cardiac remodeling &#8594; improved morbidity/mortality.Post myocardial infarctionAlso used in kidney disease associated with diabetes &#8594; diabetic nephropathy. The idea is that ACE inhibitors start to dilate the efferent blood vessels in the kidney will decrease the pressures generated in the glomerulus and attenuate damage.Adverse Effects of ACE InhibitorsCough &#8594; common, related to bradykininDecreased Blood Pressure &#8594; well obviously, that&#8217;s the goal.Worsened Renal Function &#8594; because of dilation of the efferent arteriole.Hyperkalemia &#8594; because of the effect on Aldosterone, which is involved in K+ excretion. (affects Na+, K+ pumps)Angioedema &#8594; localized swelling. Rare, but can be serious if it involves the face and tongue (airway obstruction). Related to bradykinin.ContraindicationsPatients who already have high potassium.Patients who have normal/low blood pressure.Patients with a previous angioedema.Patients with a cough with an ACE inhibitorPregnancy, since they seem to cause a predisposition for fetal anomalies.The cough and angioedema are bradykinin-related side-effectsAngiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) InhibitorsNamed ___ prilMechanism of ActionBlocks the formation of Angiotensin II from Angiotensin IAngiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, increases aldosterone levels, and affects heart remodeling, hypertrophy, and fibrosis,ACEI blocks this, so they cause vasodilation, increased fluid loss from kidneys, reduced sympathetic activity, reduced remodeling.IndicationsHypertensionSystolic Heart FailurePost Myocardial InfarctionDiabetic NephropathyContraindicationsHyperkalemiaNormotensive/HypotensivePrevious angioedemaPrevious cough with ACEIPregnancyAngiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB)ARBs generally are ___ sartan drugs.Examples include:candesartanirbesartanlosartantelmisartanvalsartanetc.Mechanism of ActionThey block the angiotensin II receptors.Since they don&#8217;t block ACE, Bradykinin is still broken down!Hence, they do the same things as ACEI, minus the Bradykinin mediated effects.So they still vasodilate, inhibit modeling/fibrosis, and downregulate the SNSIndicationsThe same indications as with ACEI!HypertensionHeart failureMyocardial infarctionDiabetic nephropathyHowever, they&#8217;re generally used if ACEI is indicated but not tolerated, such as with bradykinin-mediated effects:CoughAngioedemaThis is because ACEI are much better studied and have a clear impact on mortality &#8212; it&#8217;s difficult to come up with an ethical trial comparing the effects of the two!SummaryARBs do the same thing as ACEIs, but they don&#8217;t have the bradykinin mediated effects because they don&#8217;t affect ACE mediated breakdown of bradykinin.Hence, they&#8217;re used in the same scenarios as with ACEI (CHF, diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, MI), but only if the patient has cough or angioedema from ACEI due to the bradykinin effects.Aldosterone Antagonists (ARB)Aldosterone functions by:Mediating salt and water renention, K+ excretion.Myocardial and vascular fibrosis.Recall that aldosterone binds to basolateral Na+/K+ pumps, and upregulates their action! This ultimately increases Na reabsorption, and K efflux.One aldosterone antagonist is spironolactoneMechanism of action of SpironolactoneCompetitive antagonist to aldosterone.&#8216;Potassium sparing diuretic&#8217; since by competitively inhibiting aldosterone binding, it maintains potassium in the body.This means that patients on Spironolactone are at risk for hyperkalemia!IndicationsCongestive Heart Failure &#8594; shown to improve morbidity and mortalityThe reason for this is that, as heart failure progresses, patients tend to active the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system because of reduced cardiac output.If we block some of these compensatory mechanisms, it seems as if outcomes are improved. It seems as if compensatory bodily mechanisms aim to improve short-term prognoses at the expense of long-term prognoses.Adverse EffectsHyperkalemia &#8594; obviously, if Aldosterone binding is inhibited, systemic potassium levels are increased.Hence, if the patient has renal dysfunction, the use of Spironolactone is cautioned/contraindicated.In treating a patient with hyperkalemia, stopping the drug and starting on a low potassium diet is usually the treatment. In severe hyperkalemia, hemodialysis is used.In this case, Hemodialysis involves dialysis with a low potassium solution on one side, allowing for the diffusion of the high potassium out of the body.Gynecomastia &#8594; Spironolactone also has anti-androgenic effects.Gynecomastia is the formation of breats in men.Obviously, this may not be very appealing.EplerenoneEplerenone is an aldosterone antagonist like spironolactone.Has less of an anti-adrogenic effect, and therefore less gynecomastia.However, it&#8217;s really expensive! $3.00/day, vs &lt; 10 cents/dayStudies on Aldosterone AntagonistsImproved mortality was shown with Spironolactone in a landmark study called RALES.Similar results were shown in patients with more severe heart failure, in the EMPHASIS-HF trial studying Eplerenone.However, as a consequence, rates of hospital admissions for Hyperkalemia have increased dramatically!SummaryAldosterone antagonists (like Spironolactone and Eplerenone) are used in patients with congestive heart failure.However, they increase the risk of hyperkalemia. In the case of spironolactone, it may also cause gynecomastia due to anti-androgenic effects.DigoxinDigoxin is also known as Digitalis, and used to be isolated from the foxglove plant, or Digitalis purpura.It is a postive inotrope (improves contractility).Physiologically, it has two functions:It inhibits the Na+/K+ ATPaseWithout the Na+/K+ pump, sodium accumulates in the cell.As a response, the cell uses a Na+/Ca++ pump, which causes an accumulation of intracellar calciumThis increases myocardial contractility!Indirect Vagal (PSNS) EffectsRecall that the vagus nerve is involved in parasympathetic function! (decreases rate of depolarization)Digoxin decreases the intrinsic rate of the SA node.Also decreases condution velocity through the AV node. (Recall, SA &#8594; AV &#8594; His/Purkinje system)Since digoxin reduces conduction through the AV node through this vagal effect, the heart rate will slow and improve symptoms of patients with atrial fibrillationPharmacologyLong half life (around 36 hours, 1.5 days)Very narrow therapeutic ratio (you have to carefully titrate dosages!)This means that if you give too much digoxin, it&#8217;ll rapidly have toxic effects!Renal excretion. Must manage dosage in patients with kidney failure!Drug InterationsLots of drug interactions (especially with an anti-arrythmic called amiodarone)If started, can increase digoxin levels.IndicationsSystolic Heart FailureIncreased contractility (&#8217;inotropy&#8217;)No overall improvement in mortality.But decreases hospital admissions!Note: Low doses only!Digoxin is basically one of the only positive-inotropes that does not have a negative effect on mortality!In the past, lots of other drugs (eg. phosphodiesterase inhibitors), which increase cAMP intraceullarly, and improve contractility and EF, were studied.They improved symptoms, but there was a dose-dependent increase in mortality!It was as if we took a failing heart and made it work harder &#8594; but made it die earlier!Because of this, physicians worried that digoxin may have been doing the same, and we had been using it for so long!But studies such as the one described above showed that it had no effect on mortality.Chronic Atrial FibrillationRecall, digoxin slows conduction rate through the AV node.Decreases heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation.This effect is very weak, hence it&#8217;s not useful in patients with a high sympathetic tone, or to control HR when a patient is exercising.The weak PSNS effect of digoxin is easily overcome by other SNS effects!Hence, it may be better in more sedentary, older patients.Also, it does not convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Digoxin affects rate control, but not rhythm control.Adverse EffectsSince Digoxin messes around with Na+/K+ pumps, it can cause a wide range of symptoms:Increased risk of hypokalemia (low potassium)Increased risk of any type of arrythmias with digoxin toxicity.Increased risk of AV blocksOther adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, psychotic symptoms, yellow-green vision (Xanthopsia), halos in visionSummaryDigoxin is effectively only used in two situations:Slowing the heart in patients with atrial fibrillation (but no rhythm control)Increasing heart contractlity. in patients with heart failure.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/17/intro-cardiovascular-pharmacology.html"},
	{"title": "Heart Anatomy Lab", "text": "The PericardiumThe pericardium is the sac that encloses the heart and the roots of the great vessels. It&#8217;s composed of two types of material:Fibrous Pericardium: The fibrous pericardium is an outer layer of the pericardium. It&#8217;s a dense fibrous sheet that attaches and blends inferiorly into the central tendon of the diaphragm. Superiorly it goes a short distance along the great vessels and then merges with their outer coats.Serous Pericardium: There is a visceral serous pericardium that surrounds the organs of the pericardial sac itself, namely the heart and the roots of the great vessels. This serous pericardium then reflects (bends around) to wrap around the fibrous pericardium &#8212; this region is known as the parietal serous pericardium.The pericardial cavity is the space between the visceral (inner) and parietal (outer) serous pericardium &#8212; it typically contains a thin film of serous fluid.Diagram of how the serous pericardium reflects to form the visceral serous pericardium and the parietal serous pericardium.SummaryFibrous Pericardium: At the superior end it travels along the great vessels and blends into them. At the inferior end it attaches to the central tendon of the diaphragmSerous Pericardium: The visceral serous pericardium is wrapped around the heart and roots of the great veseels. It then reflects outwards to wrap around the fibrous pericardium, forming a parietal serous pericardiumSagittal view of the thorax showing the pericardial layers as well as the pericardial sac separating the visceral serous pericardium and the parietal serous pericardium/fibrous pericardium.The Heart and its ValvesThe heart starts as a straight tube during development, which undergoes folding. The wall becaomes more muscular, and internal septa are formed which divide the heart into four chambers. The resulting pump serves both the pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation, as described previously. The two circulations form a &#8216;figure-8&#8217; flow of blood through the body.External Features of the HeartRecall that the heart is shifted such that the right side is anterior to the left side, with the apex of the heart angling laterally to the left.The superior vena cava enters the superior aspect of the right atrium, and the inferior vena cava enters the right atrium inferiorly &#8212; as with their name!There is a small ear-like projection from the right atrium called the right auricle, which extends anteriorly to the root of the aorta.The right ventricle forms most of the anterior surface of the heart. The right ventricle is separated from the right atrium by a series of grooves, the atrioventricular (coronary) sulcus, wraps around the heart. (See the green in the below diagram)The pulmonary trunk is the root of the pulmonary arteries, which later divides into the left pulmonary artery and the right pulmonary artery, which leave the superior part of the right ventricle.The left ventricle forms the left border of the heart, and is separated from the right ventricle by the anterior interventricular sulcus in the front, and the posterior interventricular sulcus in the back. (Again, see the green in the below diagram)The aorta emerges from the superior aspect of the LV.The left atrium takes up a lot of the posterior surface, and a small part of the left border of the heart. two right pulmonary veins and two left pulmonary veins open into it (4 veins in total). The left auricle is a projection from the LA that extends anteriorly to the base of the pulmonary trunk.The above diagram shows the external features of the heart. Notice the atrioventricular coronary sulcus which divides the RA and RV, and the interventricular sulcus that divides the two ventricles.Internal Features of the HeartThe Right AtriumThe thin wall of the atrium is composed of two parts &#8212; a smooth posterior portion and a ridged or trabeculated anterior portion. Smooth in the back, ridged in the front.The smooth area represents where a vein was incorporated into the primitive RA. It receives blood from the SVC superiorly, and the IVC inferiorly, as well as the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus receives many of the veins that drain the heart itself.There is a ridge called the crista terminalis which corresponds to a groove called the sulcus terminalis that separates the smooth portion and the trabeculated portion of the RA.The trabeculations are due to bundles of cardiac muscle, the musculi pectinatiThe right atrium is separated from the left atrium by the interatrial septum. On the right side of the septum is a shallow depression called the fossa ovalis, which is where the foramen in the fetus used to be.The foramen allowed oxygenated blood to pass from the RA to the LA during fetal circulation, and closes soon after birth.The RA communicates with the RV through the tricuspid valve, otherwise known as the atrioventricular valve.The three flaps of the tricuspid valve are the septal, posterior, and anterior cusps.The Right VentricleThe walls of the RV are thicker than that of the RA and raised into irregular ridges called trabeculae carnae. (ie. Meaty ridges &#8212; makes sense!)Some of the trabeculae form papillary muscles which project towards the cusps of the tricuspid valve.Chordae tendinae connect the cusps of the tricuspid valve to the papillary muscles. These are thin tendinous cords.The chordae tendinae and the papillary muscles are there to prevent the cusps of the valve from being pushed back into the RA during RV contraction. They keep the cusps in place.There is a moderator band thaat passes from the interventricular septum to the base of the anterior papillary muscle of the anterior wall. It contains part of the conducting system of the heart.The RV opens into the pulmonary trunk which divides into the right pulmonary artery and the left pulmonary artery.There is a pulmonary valve at the origin of the pulmonary trunk with three cusps &#8212; the right, left, and anterior cusps. There are three corresponding pulmonary sinuses immediately past the valve.The purpose of the sinuses is to collect blood dusing ventricular diastole. After blood is forced into the pulmonary trunk during systole, the back flow collects in the sinuses, and causes pressure that closes the valve.The Left AtriumRecall, there are four pulmonary veins! Two left ones and two right ones!The walls of the LA are smooth except in the left auricle where there is some musculi pectinati.The pulmonary veins enter the posterior wall of the LA, and a bicuspid valve (mitral valve) separates the LA from the LV.The bicuspid valve has an anterior and posterior cusp, so it looks somewhat like a fish&#8217;s mouth.On the inter-atrial septum, an impression of the fossa ovalis can be seen, similarly to with the right atrium.Sometimes there may be a fistula that forms between the two atria due to improper closure of the foramen.The Left VentricleNote that the pulmonary and aortic valve have three leaflets, as with the tricuspid valve. The bicuspid/mitral valve only has 2.The left ventricle is similar to the right ventricle, except it&#8217;s around 3 times as muscular. This is because the LV has to provide systemic circulation, while the RV only has to provide pulmonary circulation.There are papillary muscles and chordae tendinae in the LV, but there isn&#8217;t a moderator band.Superiorly, the LV opens into the aorta, which is protected by an aortic semilunar valve, that resembles the pulmonary valve.The three cusps of the aortic valve are named the left, right, and posterior cusps, and behind each one is an aortic sinus, similar to how we have three pulmonary sinuses.The coronary arteries arise from the walls of the left and right sinuses. During diastole, back pressure closes the aortic valve in a similar fashion as with the pulmonary valve.At the same time as the valve closes, the backflow also pushes blood into the coronary circulationSummaryRight Atrium:The tricuspid valve has a septal, posterior, and anterior cuspThe RA has a smooth posterior portion and a trabeculated anterior portion. These are separated by a ridge called the crista terminalis.The smooth part is where the RA connects to the veins: the IVC, SVC, and coronary sinus.The trabeculated part looks like that because of musculi pectinati, which are bundles of muscle fibres.Right Ventricle:The pulmonary valve has a right, left, and anterior cusp.The RA opens into the RV via the tricuspid valve, which has three leaflets named the septal, posterior and anterior cusps. Each cusp is connected to a chordae tendinae, which is in turn connected to a papillary muscles.The RV has a moderator band which connects the posterior papillary muscle and the interventricular septum, and helps mediate electrical conduction.The RV pushes blood through a pulmonary valve, which has three leaflets named the left, right, and anterior cusps. There is a sinus past each cusp, which collects blood during diastole and causes back pressure that closes the valve.Left Atrium:The 4 pulmonary veins enter the posterior side of the LA. The bicuspid valve has a posterior, and anterior cusp.The bicuspid valve separates the LA and LV, and has an anterior and posterior cusp.Left Ventricle:The aortic valve has a left, right, and posterior cusp.The most muscular chamber, since it must provide systemic circulation.There is no moderator band.The LV opens superiorly into the aorta, which, similarly to the pulmonary trunk, has an aortic valve with three leaflets, the left, right, and posterior leaflets.As before, there are aortic sinuses behind each leaflet, which provide backflow for valve closure. They also allow for coronary circulation during diastole!Coronary CirculationThe heart is a very active organ &#8212; it needs its own bloody supply. This is provided by the right and left coronary arteries, which are the first two branches of the (ascending) aorta.The Coronary ArteriesThe Right Coronary ArteryRecall that the atrio-ventricular sulcus is the groove that travels laterally along the heart and separates the atria and ventriclesThe right coronary artery leaves the right aortic sinus and passes along the atrio-ventricular sulcus, at first anteriorly, and then posteriorly.Along the way, it gives off many branches, including:The nodal artery which passes to the right atriumThe marginal artery, which passes along the inferior border of the heart.The posterior interventricular branch, which, obviously, passes along the posterior interventricular sulcus.The Left Coronary ArteryThe left coronary artery passes from the left aortic sinus (recall that there is a right, left, and posterior aortic sinus), which is between the left auricle and the pulmonary trunk, before it divides into two branches:The circumflex artery, which passes along the atrio-ventricular sulcus, between the LA and LV to the back of the heart where it may anastomose with the corresponding branch of the right coronary artery.The left anterior descending artery (LAD), which is anatomically, the anterior interventricular artery, which passes along the anterior part of the interventricular sulcus. Eventually, it may merge with the posterior interventricular branch of the right coronary artery.SummaryRight Coronary ArteryWraps around the right side of the heart, along the atrio-ventricular sulcus.Also has a posterior interventricular branch that goes along the back of the heart, along the interventricular sulcus.Hence the right coronary artery goes along the back, and to the right.Left Coronary ArteryHas a circumflex artery that wraps around the left side of the heart, along the atrio-ventricular sulcus. This can merge with the corresponding artery on the right side.Also has a left anterior descending artery, which is an anterior interventricular artery, which goes along the front of the heart, along the interventricular sulcus.Again, it can merge with the posterior interventricular branch form the right coronary artery.Hence the left coronary artery goes along the front, and to the leftCardiac Veins and SinusesRecall, the front (anterior) interventricular branch goes with the left coronary artery!Most of the cardiac veins drain into the right atrium via the coronary sinus.The great (left) cardiac vein accompanies the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery. It then passes behind the atrioventricular sulcus and becomes the coronary sinus.The great cardiac vein also receives the posterior vein of the left ventricle.The middle cardiac vein and the small cardiac vein and the oblique cardiac vein also drain into the coronary sinus. They come from the posterior part of the interventricular sulcus, RV, and LA respectively.SummaryThe following merge into the coronary sinus:The great cardiac vein (from the anterior interventricular sulcus), which also receives the posterior vein of the LV (from the LV)The middle cardiac vein (from the posterior part of the interventricular sulcus).The small cardiac vein from the RV.The oblique cardiac vein from the LA.In summary, all 3 chambers of the heart (excluding the RA, which receives the coronary sinus), have an associated vein.There is also the great cardiac vein and middle cardiac vein that receive blood from the front and back of the interventricular sulcus respectively.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/16/anatomy-lab-heart.html"},
	{"title": "The Heart as a Pump III", "text": "ContractilityContractility aka. Inotropy.An inotrope would be a drug that makes the heart beat faster.Contractility is an intrinsic property of muscle cells &#8212; its ability to shorten in response to a stimulus.Unlike preload and afterload, which are interdependent (eg. via ventricular radius), contractility is independent.Contractility is increased with sympathetic nervous system activation, and decreased with parasympathetic nervous system activation.Sympathetic &#8593; = Contractility &#8593;Parasympathetic &#8593; = Contractility &#8595;Frank-Starling CurvesRecall that an increase in contractility will increase the stroke volume &#8594; makes sense!In systolic heart failure, the ventricle is dilated, and less able to contract, so the curve is less steep (the increase in contractility with an increase in volume is reduced)For instance, when you&#8217;re scared, your preload doesn&#8217;t change at all, but your contractility does &#8212; you&#8217;re more responsive to changes in volume!In people with poor hearts, this response is impaired! Contractility is reduced for each volume point. This makes them more vulnerable to volume overload!Case Example 1Case Summary45 year old malePresents to ER with fever, light headed and back painDiagnosed with pyelonephritis (urinary tract/kidney infection)Past Medical History: hypertension - untreatedMedications - noneNo AllergiesOn Exam:Warm, pink, good cap refillBP = 85/55 (usual for him is 150/90)HR = 120 (sinus. ie, normal rhythm)Saturation = 93% on room airRR = 22/minUrine output &lt; 20 ml last hourTemp = 39.1 celsius - Not much else except for pain at right costo-phrenic angleNote that we always try to reference a patient&#8217;s normal blood pressure to determine if it&#8217;s pathologic!Slightly tachypneicReduced urine outputSomewhat febrileWhat is wrong in this case?Why is he so hypotensive?Sepsis! It causes the systemic vasodilation that causes the marked reduction in blood pressure!Recall that sepsis progresses to severe sepsis when there&#8217;s evidence of end-organ dysfunction!Here we have evidence of end-organ dysfunction as there&#8217;s kidney dysfunction! This is bad.How are aspects of cardiac physiology deranged?Recall that we often substitute the MAP (mean arterial pressure) for the afterload clinically. Similarly, atrial pressure is the surrogate for preload.Note that his JVP was not elevated.Recall that he seems warm, pink and has good capillary refill.The heart rate increases to increase cardiac output to compensate for the systemic vasodilation.Preload: &#8595; because of systemic vasodilation.Afterload: &#8595; because of reduced pressure due to vasodilation.Contractility: &#8593; probably, because of activation of the sympathetic response, to try to compensate for the reduced preload and afterload.Same thing applies to heart rate.Recall that we have dimishing returns with increases in HR, to increase cardiac output. If we increase it too much, SV falls because our diastolic filling time becomes too short!Why is the patient hypoxic?Systemic inflammation causes vascular leakage via endothelial junctional retraction, which impairs surface area for gas exchange in the lungs.Urine output falls because of:The Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone System, where, as blood pressure falls, aldosterone is produced, which maintains sodium and reduces fluid loss from the kidney.ADH responds when you are hypovolemic, which increases fluid return in the collecting tubules.Recall that Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) is involved when we are hypertensive, as it is produced in response to atrial stretch!How would be treat this patient?Break it down physiologically.Patient has sinus tachycardia.Monitor ABCs (airways, breathing, circulation), Oxygen, IV.What would we do with respect to his:Heart Rate: Leave that shit alone! Never try to alter a compensatory mechanism, or you&#8217;ll make things worse. If it&#8217;s a physiological tachycardia, that&#8217;s okay!Blood Pressure: This should be ameliorated by fluid, but if it still keeps falling, you can give the patient a vasoconstrictor. This is typically an &#945; constrictor, which typically causes vasoconstriction, versus a &#946; constrictor, which causes increased HR, contractility, and vasodilation. Norepinephrine is what we would typically give.Preload: To increase his preload, give him fluid, eg. saline.We would also lie him down and raise his legs up.The downside to giving fluid, is that it&#8217;ll affect his oxygen saturation, because his capillaries are already leaking, so it&#8217;ll further impair gas exchange!Hence we also give the patient oxygen!We would also give the patient antibiotics! Since this is a critical situation, there&#8217;s no time to figure out what bacteria is involved. So we give them wide spectrum antibiotics, eg. piperacillin/tazobactam, a carbapenem like imipenem, or a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin)Likely culprits are E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus.Picking the right antibiotic is probably the most important element of treating sepsis!Case Example 2Case Summary38 year old maleMorbid obesityIncreasing fatigue and shortness of breath over the past 3 months.Worsening over the previous 2 days.Vitals:Awake, alert and cooperative, anxious.Cool peripherally, decreased capillary refill.RR 28 (tachypneic)HR 128 (tachycardic)BP 88/64 (hypotensive)JVP elevatedPeripheral edemaWhat kinds of things might you be thinking of?The elevated JVP with the systemic hypertension suggests that the problem involves right side of the heart!This is an unusual finding!The peripheral edema also suggests that there&#8217;s fluid filling up!Hence we would look into the right ventricleOne clue is the decreased capillary refill &#8594; this is a typical finding in vasoconstriction! This means that the reduced blood pressure might not be due to relative hypovolemia due to vasodilation.This means that the problem might involve decreased cardiac outputWhat factors determine blood pressure?Cardiac OutputVascular ResistanceRecall that P = F &#215; R!What would you consider is the most important factor in this patient based on the information so far?Cardiac Output, because we observe hypotension with signs of peripheral vasoconstriction.Since CO = HR &#215; SV, and since the HR &#8593;, this is probably a problem with the stroke volume.How, recall that the factors that affect stroke volume are:Preload &#8594; is the patient volume depleted?Afterload &#8594; could have a valvular heart problem like aortic stenosis.ContractilityNow we&#8217;re narrowing down the issue to one of these factors!Upon physical exam, we now notice the following:Physical Exam:Heart sounds normal but distantNo murmurUrine output &lt; 20 mL/hourThe urine output makes sense, as the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system and the ADH system function to retain fluid with BP falls.The distant heart sounds suggest that there&#8217;s something in the way. For instance, fluid in the pericardium.Since there&#8217;s no murmur, it&#8217;s unlikely to be a valvular problem.The high JVP also does not agree with volume depletion or hypotension.What can cause an elevated JVP?RV FailureTricuspid regurgitationPericardial effusion that puts pressure on the heart and increases filling pressures.Pulmonary hypertensionEmboli, such as a pulmonary embolus.To differentiate between these diagnostically, we could do a chest x-ray or an ultrasound.The above is a normal chest x-ray, compared to the patient&#39;s. He had a very very large heart silhouette, and the dark regions, which represent the air-filled pleural enclosures, are noticeably diminishedDiagnosisThe echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion.This caused pressure on the heart, causing a cardiac tamponade.Cardiac Tamponade: an acute pericardial effusion where fluid accumulates faster than the pericardium can stretch.This puts pressure on the heart.The heart was contracting normally, but venous return was affected.Hence the compressed heart could not fill during diastole, so the blood backs up, causing the elevated JVP and peripheral edema.Since there was insufficient ventricular filling, there wasn&#8217;t enough blood to pump!Hence the major problem here was with preload &#8594; the end diastolic volume was affected by the pericardial effusion!What would make the patient worse?Anything that decreases preload!Also anything that decreases his heart rate, because that&#8217;s a compensatory mechanism!The severity of the cardiac tamponade depends on if it presents rapidly or more slowly.Slower pericardial effusion allows the pericardium to stretch, making it more compliant.If effusion is rapid however, there is no time to stretch, so the pericardium is less compliant! So very little fluid is needed to cause hemodynamic problems and cardiac tamponade.How would you treat the patient?Remove the fluid! percutaneous interventionPericardiocentesis: Fluid aspiration from the pericardium.The right chest X-ray shows the patient after pericardiocentesis.

Whenever you&#8217;re working with a patient, you have to manipulate the balance between preload and afterload.Tension can be calculated with the following relationship:the Law of Laplace:T = (P &#215; r)/((R-r) &#215; 2)T = The tension that must be exerted.P = Pressurer = Internal RadiusR = External RadiusHence R - r is the wall thickness of the ventricle.Afterload in Clinical SettingsTension = (Pressure &#215; Radius)/(Wall thickness &#215; 2)We&#8217;re not very good at measuring radius, which would also factor into preload (recall that preload = EDV).Hence preload and afterload are intertwined.What we can measure easily is pressure! Hence we refer to the mean arterial pressure (MAP) as the &#8216;afterload&#8217;.This sort of makes sense &#8212; if we have a high MAP, it&#8217;ll take more tension from the left ventricle to eject blood because of the increased pressure on the aortic valve!So clinically simplified, Afterload &#8594; MAP.What conditions might increase LV afterload?Aortic stenosisCongestive heart failure - dilated LV &#8594; radius increases &#8594; tension (afterload) increases.Chronic hypertension - pressure&#8593; &#8594; afterload&#8593;What conditions might increase RV afterload?Pulmonary hypertensionHow does the heart respond to afterload?Afterload is generally very well tolerated clinically if we have a normal ventricle.A normal ventricle can generally maintain stroke volume fairly well with increased afterload.However, a failing ventricle is less able to maintain stroke volume, as seen in the figure to the right.If we had a patient with systolic heart failure, how would we change the afterload?We could reduce BP to reduce afterload! But we wouldn&#8217;t want to reduce it too much, or we would affect perfusion.We can also use an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), which can rhythmically inflate in diastole and deflate upon opening of the aortic valve. IABPs are used to treat LV failure.This increases diastolic blood pressure, and makes it easier to overcome the pressure in the aorta. Hence we decrease LV afterloadThis allows us to avoid the risk of causing hypotension which would happen with medications!Responses to an Increase in AfterloadAcutely:Ventricular dilation occurs. (ventricular volume increases)Increase in end diastolic volume (EDV)Increase in end systolic volume (ESV)The stroke volume may decreaseThe above all make sense! Just imagine increased distal pushback, and how it would affect the structure and function of the ventricle!The classic case for the RV is a massive pulmonary embolism, which occludes the pulmonary arteries and sharply increases RV afterload.In an echocardiogram, it&#8217;ll be seen as an increase in RV size, because of dilation.This can be seen in the image on the right &#8594; huge RV, even bigger than the LV!The RV can somtimes get to large that it can push across the septum and disrupt LV filling! This is known as ventricular interdependence.Chronically:There will be a compensatory responseYou will see ventricular hypertrophy.This also brings about an increase in wall thickness, also known as concentric hypertrophyAn example of this would be the gradual development of aortic stenosis, or hypertension.Concentric HypertrophyRecall that LV hypertrophy not only increases the oxygen requirements of the ventricle, but also increases pressures, which reduces coronary perfusionConcentric hypertrophy increases wall thickness!Recall that Tension = (Pressure &amp;times radius)/(wall thickness &#215; 2)This means that concentric hypertrophy reduces tension by increasing wall thickness &#8212; it&#8217;s a compensatory mechanismGood: decreases afterloadBad:the ventricle becomes stiffer and less compliant.Also, this increases the risk of ischemia!HypertrophyHypertrophy: With respect to the heart, it&#8217;s an increase in ventricular mass (weight)Types of Hypertrophy:Physiological Hypertrophy (eg. an Athlete&#8217;s Heart). The muscles just get bigger.Concentric Hypertrophy (eg. with chronic excess afterload). The sarcomeres start replicating in a parallel system.Eccentric Hypertrophy: (eg. Volume Overload) The ventricle gets larger, but the wall thickness does not increase. The sarcomeres replicate in seriesSystolic Heart Failure = Eccentric Hypertrophy (the ventricle gets dilated!)Diastolic Heart Failure = Concentric Hypertrophy (the ventricle gets thick and stiffened)Recall that diastolic heart failure = heart failure with preserved ejection fraction = heart failure with preserved systolic functionPhysiologic HypertrophyAthlete&#8217;s heart.Tend to have a lower resting heart rate, because of more significant parasympathetic tone.Reversible, it goes back if you stop exercising!Not dangerous unless there&#8217;s an underlying heart disease.The effect depends on the type of training. Weight training &#8594; bigger muscle, long distance running &#8594; bigger heart.Ventricular RemodelingVentricular Remodeling: The change in mass, volume, and shape of the ventricle as a compensatory response.Molecular mechanisms include hormones, eg:AldosteroneAngiotensin IICytokines (TNF, IL-1)Remodelling is not just a change in muscle mass. It also includes interstitial fibrosis, collagen deposition, and apoptosis.ComplianceCompliance is the stiffness of a ventricle.Mathematically, compliance is formulated as:Compliance:Compliance = &#916;V / &#916;PThat is, how much does the volume change with a change in pressure? (Makes sense!)Compliance isn&#8217;t linear! As the ventricle gets more and more full, it gets less compliant (see figure on right, as ventricle gets congested, increases in pressure cause negligible changes in volume)This means that there will start to be backflow, and eventually pulmonary edema (when referring to the LV).Concepts in ComplianceVentricular compliance reflects the stiffness of the ventricle. The more compliant, the less stiff!Decreased compliance can be caused by:HypertrophyIschemiaScar TissueIncreased compliance can be caused by: - Ventricular dilationThe right ventricle is generally more compliant, as it works in a lower pressure system, and is less muscular.Compliance CurvesNormal (control)Aortic Stenosis: Pressure overload causes LV hypertrophy &#8594; reduced compliance. Can predispose a patient to pulmonary edema because of backflow!Aortic Insufficiency: Volume overload (dilation) &#8594; increased compliance.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Pathologic hypertrophy, severe reduction in compliance.Case Example:68 year old manAcute shortness of breath. Required intubation and mechanical ventilation.Past history of ischemic heart disease.Crackles upon auscultation.Chest X-Ray shows white patches in the lung, where it should all be black. This suggests fluid in the lungs &#8594; pulmonary edema!Five things that can cause pulmonary edema:WaterPusProteinBloodCancer cellsThe most likely thing causing the pulmonary edema, given his history of ischemic heart disease is water, followed by blood.This fluid effusion creates the crackly sound in the lungs!What are the factors involved in the development of pulmonary edema?If we have effusion of water from the lungs, it&#8217;s called pulmonary edema.Increase in Capillary Hydrostatic PressureThis is probably caused by backflow from the left ventricle because of excess LV pressure.The excess hydrostatic pressure in the alveoli in the lungs causes fluid to move out!Decrease in Interstitial Oncotic PressureSome patients have non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, where the patient has normal heart function, but it&#8217;s actually an oncotic pressure problemIf the oncotic pressure falls (eg, low albumin, seen in Kwashiorkor), then fluid leaks everywhere &#8594; looks like the &#8216;Michelin Man&#8217;!&#8216;Leaky&#8217; Pulmonary edemaFor example, ARDS = Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, patients will have leaky capillaries.Recall that histamine can mediate endothelial separation, as well as endothelial injury.Block of LymphaticsIn this circumstance, because of his Hx of ischemic heart disease, excess hydrostatic pressure is likely the problem!$$Q_f = K_f \big[(P_{mv} - P_i) - \sigma_f(\pi_{mv} - \pi_{i}) \big]$$Where we have that:Pmv is the microvascular hydrostatic pressurePi is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure&#960;mv is the microvascular oncotic pressure&#960;i is the interstitial oncotic pressureKf is the filtration coefficient &#8212; a proportionality constant&#963;f is the reflection coefficientPossible Causes of the Pulmonary EdemaNote that this may not be a volume problem (systolic heart failure)It could also be diastolic heart failure, as we discussed before.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/16/heart-pump-2.html"},
	{"title": "Interpreting ECGs Ib", "text": "Ancillary NotesBody size/weight generally doesn&#8217;t interfere with electrical conduction, but fluid around the heart because of pericardial effusion does dampen conduction!.Hence a diagnostic feature of pericardial effusion is a lowered QRS in every lead!The arrangement of the ECG leads are shown on the figure to the right. Note that the 4th limb lead, typically on the right leg, functions as a ground lead.Calculation of AxisThe axis is in the frontal plane, so you only look at the limb leadsThe bottom line is that the axis is the net vector along the frontal plane.Basically, the idea is how we can take the information from the 6 limb leads, and reconstruct the direction of net electrical flow.We arbitrarily label straight left = 0&#176;. (towards the patient&#8217;s heart)Anything below that is positive.Anything above that is negative.A normal axis is between -30 and 90 degrees in an adult. (Mostly down and to the left)How can we easily determine if it&#8217;s a normal axis without having to compute the sum of the vectors?If the straight left lead (lead I) is positive, then we&#8217;re obviously in the left half.Similarly, if the straight bottom lead (aVF) is positive, then we&#8217;re obviously in the bottom halfSummaryOur first screening test is to ensure that lead I and lead aVF are positiveWhat if it&#8217;s between -30 and 90 degrees? It&#8217;ll still be considered a normal axis, but it wouldn&#8217;t satisfy the first screening test!To get between 0 and 120, you would use lead 1 and lead 2!If lead 2 is positive, it&#8217;ll mean that it&#8217;s between -30 and +150.If lead 1 is positive, it means that it&#8217;s between -90 and 90.The intersection gives you -30 to +90Calculating the AxisUse lead 1 and lead aVF to establish the quadrant.Find the isoelectric lead, that&#8217;s perpendicular to that. Recall that this is the one where there&#8217;s as much positive as there is negative.Then look for the largest QRS, it should be close to that!Example 1Lead 1 is positive, except for a small q-wave, which is expected (recall that it&#8217;s septal depolarization)aVF is positive.This means we&#8217;re in the lower-left quadrant &#8594; normal axis!Q-waves are most easily seen in II, III, and aVF usually. (the ones heading downwards).Now we find the iso-electric lead, which seems to be aVL. (look to the right of the label).aVL points towards the L sticker, so it&#8217;s 30&#176; above 0. The perpendicular is then the line between 60&#176; and -120&#176;.Since we know we&#8217;re in the lower-left quadrant, the axis has to be 60&#176;60&#176; corresponds to lead II, which is also has the largest QRS! Everything makes sense.SummaryLead I and aVF are positive &#8594; lower-left quadrant.Isoelectric lead = aVL, so perpendicular to lead II.Lead II has the largest QRS From these, it&#8217;s easy to see that the normal axis is 60&#176;Example 21 is positive, aVF is sort of borderline, but more positive than negativeIsoelectric is lead IIIMax QRS is lead IIThis suggests that the axis is in the lower-left quadrant.It&#8217;s perpendicular to lead III, which runs from L &#8594; F. So it angles from -60 to 120. Hence the perpendicular is +30&#176;, which is the axis.It&#8217;s also close to the angle of lead II, so everything seems to agree. Since II is stronger than I on the ECG, it&#8217;d probably be from +30 to +60, rather than from 0 to +30.Example 3Lead I +, Lead aVF 0Isoelectric = aVF or IIIMax QRS = ISince aVF = 0, it&#8217;s probably right on the midline. So it should be angling directly left. This agrees with Max QRS = I.So this is probably a 0&#176; axis.Example 4I +, aVF - &#8594; upper-left quadrant.Isoelectric = aVRMax QRS = III (in negative direction)The axis is -60&#176;ECG Changes in Ischemic Heart DiseaseIschemic Heart Disease (IHD) can cause changes in the Q-wave, ST-segment, and T-wave, depending on the timing and severity of the ischemia.Q-waves are permanent, while the ST-segment and T-wave tend to come back to normal after recovery.The baseline is the TP-segment, between the T-wave and the P-wave.This is because after the T-wave, the heart has completely repolarized, and no other depolarization occurs until the P-wave (recall, atrial depolarization)So when we talk about ST-elevation or ST-depression, we mean elevation/depression relative to the TP-segment.ST-ElevationST-segment elevated above baseline.It typically suggests a transmural infarction (entire wall).Here you see that the elevated ST-segment effectively blends into the T-wave as well, making it a little harder to see.ST-DepressionST-segment below the TP-segment here.Is suggests subendocardial ischemia, but not necesasrily an infarction.ST-depression coupled with T-wave inversion would be more characteristic of ischemia, versus ST-elevation plus large Q-waves.T-Wave InversionT-wave inversion could either be ischemia or evolving changes after an infarct.The region between the ST-segment and the TP-segment is inverted here.This means that the direction of repolarization has changed &#8594; suggestive of ischemia or changes in the nature of conduction because of an infarct.Large Q-WavesPathologically large Q-waves suggest completed transmural infarctions.They&#8217;re effectively a record of a past MI.They tend to cluster in leads reflecting tissue damage!So a lateral MI will give large Q-waves in I, aVL, V5 and V6.An inferior MI will give large Q-waves in II, III, aVF.An antero-septal/anterior MI will give large Q-waves in V1, V2, V3.These all make sense when you look at the axis diagram, and if you understand where the leads are placed anatomically.The leads that aim laterally, interiorly, and posteriorly correspond to the location of the MI.Example 1The ST-segment before the large hump is above the TP-segment &#8594; ST-elevation.The QRS-complex is negative, suggesting flow away from V2.ST-shifts are described in mm, not mV, by convention.This is seen in both examples.In the ECG on the right, the R-wave seems to be lost because of development of the Q-wave, suggesting a current transmural infarct.Aneurysms (localized, blood filled ballooning) can also cause localized ST-elevation.Example 2ST-depression is seen here &#8594; ischemic changes!The T-wave is also invertedFor the ECG on the right &#8594; the ST-segment is normal, but the T-wave in inverted.If the patient on the right is also complaining of chest pain, it&#8217;s more likely to be ischemia than an infarct, because of the lack of Q-waves, and no ST-elevation.For this patient, we see a case where the T-wave is barely visible.T-wave flattening could be due to ischemia as well!The amplitude of the ECG is probably due to the lead, and not any pathology.SummaryST-Elevation = MI/Pericarditis/Aneurysm.ST-Depression = Ischemic changes.T-wave inversion = Ischemic changes, or changing conduction as an infarct progresses.Q-waves = A previous MI. Will see them in areas corresponding to the location of the past MI.ECG Changes with HypertrophyGeneral PrinciplesAny of the 4 chambers can develop hypertrophy.Increased muscle mass = increased voltage.Find the lead(s) that sample the chamber of interest!1. The Right AtriumSince the P-wave corresponds to atrial depolarization, a hypertrophic RA corresponds to a larger P-wave.The lead corresponding to the RA is intuitively the one going from R &#8594; F, which is II.This could be because of tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, or other right sided problems.2. The Left AtriumThis typically manifests as a change in the P-wave in V1.Normally you have a positive and negative component to the P-wave actually.But if the down-component gets larger than 1 box &#215; 1 box, it suggests some sort of pathology!Also if you have a biphasic P-wave, as shown.Left atrial enlargement could be due to mitral insufficiency, aortic stenosis, hypertension.3. The Right VentricleIncreased voltage in V1-V3 (the leads that lie on top of the RV)If the R-wave in V1 is bigger than the S-wave, then that suggests that maybe the RV is too big.It would mean that too much current is coming towards the RV, since V1 sits right on top of the RV.Aside from that, there isn&#8217;t much else that can be obtained, since the RV is a smaller/thinner structure than the LV.4. The Left VentricleHypertrophy in the LV is typically seen with a large S-wave in V1 &amp; V2, and a large R-wave in V5 &amp; V6.This makes sense intuitively because V1 &amp; V2 are right on top of the RV, so the S-wave, corresponding to the end of ventricular depolarization, should be more negative for the LV.V5 &amp; V6 sit on top of the LV, so current comes towards them during ventricular depolarization. This corresponds to the large R-wave.So if you sum up the S-waves in V1 &amp; V2, plus the R-waves in V5 &amp; V6 and get &gt; 35 mm, then that&#8217;s the arbitrary cutoff for LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy)	Summary of Hypertrophic Changes	Bundle BranchesBelow the AV node is the His bundle which splits into bundle branchesThe Left Bundle Branch (LBB) splits into two bundles, and feeds the septum and LV.The Right Bundle Branch (RBB) feeds the RV.If one of these bundle branches is blocked, then instead of using specialized cardiac tissue, the electricity must go through myocardium.This is a much slower process!This manifests as a wider QRS complex.So the most common differential diagnoses for a QRS &gt; 120 ms are:Left Bundle Branch BlockRight Bundle Branch BlockThis can happen gradually, or acutely (eg. after an infarction).To diagnose a wide QRS, count the number of boxes horizontally that the QRS occupies. &gt; 3 = &gt; 120 ms = Wide-QRS.Above is a normal ECG. The QRS is less than 120 ms! Notice how the S-wave is much bigger than the R-wave in V1. This is normal! Recall that having an R-wave that&#39;s larger than the S-wave in V1 suggests RV hypertrophy, since it means that too much current is moving towards the RV, where V1 is sitting.Right Bundle Branch BlockDelay conducting through the RV.The LBB is fine, so it actives the septum and LV. But the RV activation occurs slowly.Because it activates late, we look at the direction at the end of the QRS. Makes sense!If we look at the end of the QRS in V1 (seen below), you see that it&#8217;s positive. This means that at the end of the QRS, you see flow coming towards V1So V1 is usually our first screening test for an RBB.Similarly, the end of V5 &amp; V6 should be negative, since electricity should be flowing away from the LV.An example of a Right Bundle Branch Block. Here, the leads on top of the RV, like V1, V2, and V3, show a positive component at the end of the QRS. The ones near the LV, with electricity flowing away (V5, V6), should have a negative component at the end.Left Bundle Branch BlockHere, we also see a wide end of the QRS.Recall that if the R-wave is larger than the S-wave in the anterior chest leads, then it suggests that we could have RV hypertrophy.We see a sharp upstroke and downstroke in V1, V2, V3. Since the S-wave is larger than the R-wave, it suggests that the RV is working fine.The leads that look away from the left will have a deep and wide negative component like V1, V2, V3.The leads that face the left (V5, V6, I, aVL) will have a more positive component at the end of the QRS,An example of a Left Bundle Branch Block. You see a deep and wide negative component at the end of the QRS for V1, V2, V3. It&#39;s less negative in the leads that have flow going towards the LV, like V5, V6, I, and also aVLBundle Branch SummaryConsider a Right Bundle Branch Block or a Left Bundle Branch Block if you have a QRS &gt; 120 ms.In a RBB, you have a positive component in V1, V2, &amp; V3 at the end of the QRS, and a negative one in V5 &amp; V6.In a LBB, you have a positive component in V5 &amp; V6, and a negative one in V1, V2, &amp; V3.The idea is that you&#8217;re looking at the direction of flow at the delayed part of the QRS!ECG ConsiderationsRate:Use 300/150/100/75/60 rule for each large boxCount boxes for RR intervalRhythm:Where is the pacemaker of the heart, and how is it conducting?Is there a p wave preceding each QRS complex?Is there a QRS for each P wave?Are QRS complexes regular or irregular?Is the QRS wide or narrow?Axis:What is net direction of conduction?Positive in I and AVF (which quadrant)?Isoelectric lead - it is 90 degrees from where that lead &#8216;looks&#8217;?Or use I and AVF for X and Y amplitudesIntervals:PR interval, QRS duration, QT durationChamber enlargementP wave (left or right atrial abnormality)QRS (ventricular hypertrophy)Ischemia, InfarctST depression, T-wave abnormalities in ischemiaST elevation, Q waves in infarction", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/15/interpreting-ecgs-1b.html"},
	{"title": "Interpreting ECGs Ia", "text": "An introduction to Electrocardiograms.The 2 ECG lectures will supplement the readings from Dubin&#8217;s Rapid Interpretation of EKGsThe ElectrocardiogramA good analogy for ECGs is a waterfall &#8594; it shows what direction electricity is travelling.However, it&#8217;s not as smart as you &#8594; it can&#8217;t take the whole image and determine what the direction is.It takes the &#8216;image&#8217; from 12 different views.In a normal heart, electricity flows from the SA node &#8594; AV node &#8594; His-Purkinje system.An ECG effectively gives us different images from different viewpoints, that give us unique &#8216;vectors&#8217;. These are eventually summed to give us a composite &#8216;image&#8217;.Each lead can only look in one direction (ie. electricity is coming toward/away from you).If electricity is flowing towards a lead, it&#8217;ll manifest as a postive spike.If electricity is flowing away, it&#8217;ll manifest as a negative spikeIf electricity is flowing perpendicularly to the lead, it&#8217;ll manifest as an equally positive and negative spike. It doesn&#8217;t manifest as no QRS, but the positive component area will equal the negative component area!Because the leads are positioned at different spots on the body, the sign of the wave can show flow moving towards or away from a certain part of the heart.Summing these different views together produces the ECG!Key ideasElectricity coming towards a lead is positive.Electricity going away from a lead is negative.Electricity flowing perpendicular to a lead will have the an area under the curve sum to zero.The Normal ECGAbove is the typical 12 lead ECGTypically there will be 3-4 lines of data.Time is along the x-axisVoltage is along the y-axisLeads are labeled along the traceAfter a fixed amount of time, the leads that are being monitored will switch.In this case, the ECG trace is running for 10 seconds. Every 2.5 seconds it switches to a different set of leads.ECGs will almost always have leads arranged so that:Leads I, II, and III will be along the left.Next will be aVR, aVL, aVFNext will be V2, V2, V3Finally, there&#8217;ll be V4, V5, V6There should be a calibration signal on the side, that should be two big boxes high and one big box wide &#8594; shows that the paper is coming out at the proper speed, and everything is properly calibrated.There&#8217;ll typically be a little line along with the label showing when the lead has changed.These vertical lines on ECGs are artefacts &#8594; can&#8217;t have an infinite change in voltage in a physiological system! They represent lead changesThe ECG does not show things at a cellular level &#8594; it only assesses things on a macro level!Overview of the Cardiac Conduction SystemThe pace typically starts at the SA node, because it&#8217;s usually the fastest part of the heart.The signal goes from the SA in the RA to the LA via Bachmann&#8217;s bundlesIt also goes to the AV node, which sits at the junction between the atria and ventricles.The purpose of the AV node is to cause a delay! This is termed decremental conductionIn fact, the faster signals hit the AV node, the more its slowing effect acts!Once the signal passes the AV node, it travels very quickly through the His-Purkinje system.If the ventricular bundles are damaged, it takes much longer for the signal to travel through the muscle, so it will show up as a wider QRS complex.Components of the ECGWhat an ECG shows is the macro level conduction in both the atria and the ventricles.This will manifest as different waves in the ECG trace.For each heart beat, there will be (for a random lead):Atrial Depolarization &#8594; P WaveThen there will be a pause after the P-wave, due to slowing of the signal at the AV node!Ventricular Depolarization &#8594; QRS complex. Since the ventricles are larger, this results in a bigger, sharper, higher frequency waveform.Ventricular Repolarization &#8594; T-wave. Wide, low frequency.Repolarization of the atria is not visible on the ECG &#8594; it&#8217;s too minor!The waveforms will look different depending on which lead it is!SummaryThe three things you see on an ECG are:Atrial Depolarization via. a P waveVentricular Depolarization via. a QRS complexVentricular Repolzarizaion via a T waveECG LeadsCurrent &#8594; flow of electrons from the negative pole (anode) to the positive pole (cathode), by convention.Depolarization of cardiac cells results in the generation of current.The Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), measures surface electrical activationThe ECG has bipolar leads as well as unipolar leadsBipolar lead &#8594; measuring signals from one lead to another lead.Unipolar lead &#8594; taking one spot, and assessing whether current is flowing towards or away from it.The machine automatically generates the unipolar lead by summing the vectors formed by using all other leads as a pole!As we said before, current flowing towards an electrode = positive deflection.For unipolar leads, this is towards/away from a spot.For bipolar leads, this is towards/away from a cathode.The Limb LeadsRead about Einthoven&#8217;s Triangle in Dubin&#8217;s.Historically, three vectors were needed to obtain a minimum ECG.Those vectors were illustrated in what&#8217;s known as Einthoven&#8217;s triangleRight shoulder to left shoulderLeft shoulder to left legRight shoulder to left legWith these three vectors, it&#8217;s possible to obtain a rudimentary image of what&#8217;s going on in the heart.These three vectors correspond to leads I, II, and IIILead 1: R &#8594; LLead 2: R &#8594; legLead 3: L &#8594; legAn easy way to remember this is just to draw an inverted equilateral triangle, with flow moving clockwise. I is on the top, and II and III are added from (your) left to right.There are also three unipolar leads that point from the center towards each of the three vertices of the triangle:aVR: Towards R (angled up 30&#176;)aVL: Towards L (angled down 30&#176;)aVF: Towards F (directly down)These three leads are computed from other leads with some vector algebra.The Chest LeadsThe six limb leads gives us information across the frontal plane, but to obtain information perpendicularly, along the transverse plane, we use chest leads.There are six leads we stick on the chest (V1 &#8594; V6) that give up information on the transverse plane.V1 &#8594; V6 are unipolar leads that look downward into the heart.The Surface ElectrocardiogramTheoretically, we need three points along the surface of the body to obtain information along the frontal plane.In the real world, we have 4 connections.A sticker on the right shoulderA sticker on the left shoulderA sticker on the left legA ground on the right legSix more stickers are placed on the chest wall corresponding to V1 &#8594; V6.The frontal plane leads are named the limb leads.The transverse plane leads are named the chest leads.Recording an ECGECGs are printed on graph paper.Vertically, the axis corresponds to voltage, and horizontally, the axis corresponds to time.There are 1 mm boxes, and every 5 mm, there is a darker box.Vertically, each 1 mm corresponds to 0.1 mvHorizontally, each 1 mm corresponds to 40 msHence, for each 5 mm box, we have:Vertically, 5 mm = 0.5 mv, or 1 mv/cmHorizontally, 5 mm = 0.2 sThe Heart Rate in bpm can be calculated with the following formula:Heart Rate (bpm) = 60/(interval, in sec)For instance, if it took 2 big boxes, that would correspond to 0.4 sec between each beat, which corresponds to (60 sec/min)/(0.4 sec/beat) = 150 bpm.An easier way to remember this is that 1 box = 300, 2 boxes = 150, 3 boxes = 100, 4 boxes = 75, simply from dividing the 1 box value.Waveform ExamplesFor the top ECG, there are around 4 big boxes per beat &#8594; 75 bpm.For the next ECG down, there are 5 boxes &#8594; 60 bpm.For the bottom right one, there are 2 boxes &#8594; 150 bpm.This would be considered tachycardia (defined as over 100 bpm).Pretty straightforward! But if the beats don&#8217;t fall on the line, it may be a little more annoying/time-consuming to determine the heart rate.Phases of the ECGP-Wave = Atrial Depolarization.QRS-Complex = Ventricular DepolarizationT-Wave = Ventricular Repolarization.U-Wave = Thought to be repolarization of the papillary muscles or Purkinje fibres. Rarely seen on an ECG. Typically only seen in young people or the hypokalemic.The QRS complex is an amalgamation of multiple smaller waves, which will be individually discussed a little later.Intervals of the ECGPR Interval = The interval between the P wave and QRS complex.This corresponds to slowing in the AV node.Should be between 120-200 ms (3-5 small boxes)QRS Duration = Beginning of the QRS complex to the end.As mentioned before, the QRS complex can be prolonged if the specialized muscle fibres conducting signal are damaged &#8594; will use normal cardiac muscle instead.Should be &lt; 120 ms (&lt; 3 small boxes)QT Interval = Beginning of the QRS to the end of the T wave.Basically the time from the beginning of ventricular depolarization to the end of ventricular repolarization.This interval has to be corrected for heart rate. That is, how long it takes for repolarization to happen relative to the heart rate!Effectively the time it takes for ventricular systole to occur.If repolarization occurs coincident to the next QRS, that&#8217;s bad! The ventricle hasn&#8217;t repolarized before depolarization occurs again.The corrected QT should be QTc &#8804; 440 ms in males, 460 ms in femalesHow you correct it is to compute the QT divided by the square root of the RR, in sec. (RR = heart rate). Not too important to know!The Normal ECG1. The P-WaveAs we said before, the p-wave represents atrial depolarization.Abnormalities in the p-wave then obviously correspond to abnormalities in the atria.Excessive atrial stretch, such as due to a valvular disease (mitral regurgitation is the big one)If the RA is stretched, this typically corresponds to increased P-waves in II, III, aVF.If the LA is stretched (as in mitral regurgitation), this typically corresponds to a big negative component to the P-wave in lead V1.Read up on this in Dubin&#8217;s!2. The PR IntervalThe PR interval corresponds to slowing in the AV node.As we said before, it should correspond to 120 ms - 200 msIf it&#8217;s shortened, it generally suggests that there&#8217;s an accessory pathway around the AV node.The AV node usually either slows thing properly, or slows things too much. It doesn&#8217;t really slow things too little! Hence a short PR interval usually suggests a detour around the AV node. For instance, in Wolf-Parkinson-White SyndromeIf there&#8217;s a long PR interval, this suggests that there&#8217;s something pathologically wrong with the conducting tissue (eg. something wrong with the AV node/His bundles).It could also be a physiological response. For instance, when we&#8217;re sleeping, strong vagal enervation causes even slower conduction through the AV node, prolonging the PR interval. Hence, in people with high PSNS stimulation (sleepy, big meal), the PR interval may be longer.Hence, you need to know the patient context along with the ECG in order to make a diagnosis usually.3. The Q-WaveFrom septal depolarization from left to right. This is the opposite direction from conduction in most of the heart (remember conduction travels from the RA, so right &#8594; left). Hence it&#8217;ll generally manifest as a negative dip.The postive deflection of the QRS is the R-wave.If there is a negative deflection before it, it&#8217;ll be the Q-wave.There will always be an R-wave, but there may not always be a Q-wave!If there&#8217;s a negative deflection after the R-wave, it&#8217;ll an S-wave.The presence/absence of the Q-wave and the S-wave depend on the location where the lead is, and the pathology.Not all heart attacks will leave a Q-wave. If perfusion is restored quickly, and there isn't significant permanent damage to the septal wall, it may not present.The relevant pathology here is a heart attack &#8594; localized ischemia causing tissue death, affecting pumping.The ECG manifestation of patients having suffered permanent myocardial damage is a Q-wave. This will persist for life!There are normal Q-wave, and &#8216;heart-attack&#8217; Q-waves. Pathologically deep/wide Q-waves indicate myocardial damage!The definition of wide and deep is in Dubin &#8594; typically &gt; 40 ms wide, &gt; 1/3 height of the R-wave.4. The R-WaveThe rest of the ventricular depolarizationAlways upwardIt&#8217;s sharply positive since most of the leads have the flow coming towards them.If the QRS is too big, it may be because of ventricular hypertrophy.Recall that the RAAS system also leads to myocardial remodeling. Which makes sense, as the RAAS system acts to increase blood pressure.Thickening of the heart could be a compensatory mechanism due to hypertension, or aortic stenosis.Definitions for too much QRS can be seen in the Dubin&#8217;s book.Another way the heart can get too big is with dilation. (as in systolic heart failure).The heart responds to chronic pressure problems by thickening (recall, concentric hypertrophy). It responds to excess volume by dilating (recall, eccentric hypertrophy)Why would there be too much volume? Aortic regurgitation, increased preload, etc.In summary, a large QRS can suggest thickening or dilation &#8594; it doesn&#8217;t tell you what type of hypertrophy is occurring! Ausculation for murmurs may help narrow the DDx.We can even have physiological hypertrophy, as seen with an athlete! A large QRS isn&#8217;t necessarily pathological.5. The S-WaveJust the end of the QRS complex, as seen from a different lead.It just corresponds to any remaining ventricular depolarization.Always downward. Any downward deflection immediately succeeding an R wave is an S-wave!Prolongation may suggest a delay in conduction through the ventricles. One example would be a bundle branch block, where one the bundle branches going through the ventricles are blocked.6. The ST Segment:The line between the QRS and the T waveCorresponds to ventricular mechanical systole.Ischemia means that supply doesn&#8217;t meet demand &#8594; tightness and pain. This is reversible in the short term.If the coronary artery is blocked completely for a long period of time, eg. due to plaque rupture, this is a myocardial infarction.If ischemia is occurring, the ST segment tends to go down.If an MI is occurring, then the ST segment tends to go up.ST-elevation = permanent tissue damage.The typical sequence of events is ischemia (ST-depression) &#8594; MI (ST-elevation).Pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium) can be symptomatically differentiated from an MI based on whether it&#8217;s a sharp, acute pain upon inspiration, or a tightness around the chest.Also, in pericarditis, you have ST-elevation in most leads, while for an MI, you only have ST-elevation in the leads corresponding to the blocked coronary artery.6. The T-WaveVentricular repolarizationRepolarization tends to change with tissue damage or ischemia.The T-wave will tend to either flatten on invert. But you need a comparator to assess this!If you see T-waves changing minute-by-minute while you&#8217;re taking the ECG, it&#8217;s an obvious clue that you have ischemia!Since a flat/inverted T-wave &#8594; Ischemia/MI, they&#8217;re often seen in conjunction with ST-depresion and ST-elevation.Summary of the Components of the ECGP-wave: Atrial DepolarizationEnlarged/inverted P-waves &#8594; atrial stretch (mitral regurgitation, hypertension)PR-Interval: AV node slowingExtended PR-interval &#8594; Vasovagal stimulation (physiological) or damaged conductive fibres (AV/His) (pathological)Shorted PR-interval &#8594; Alternative conduction pathway around the AV Node.

	{"title": "Cardiac Electrical Physiology", "text": "The cardiac action potential differs from the one seen in neurons, primarily due to an influx of calcium ions that causes a plateau in repolarization. Some specialized cardiac cells have different chemical properties that enable them to beat endogenously.Review of Membrane PotentialsThe resting membrane potential is negative inside the cell, relative to the outside.Determinants of the membrane potential include the:Charge of each ionPermeability of the membrane to each ionRelative concentration of the ion on each side of the membrane.Potassium is more important than sodium to the resting state due to its greater permeabilityThe Na+/K+ pump also contributes to the resting potential.Neural action potentials differ from cardiac action potentials.Stimuli below the threshold potential do not trigger the firing of an action potential.Once the threshold is passed, voltage-gated sodium channels open, causing the flooding of sodium into the cell, jacking up the charge.In neurons, there is a delayed opening of potassium channels, which causes repolarization when K+ floods out of the cell.If you give a patient something that rapidly alters the K+ gradient, it can kill them! For instance, a bolus of potassium is used to kill people sentenced to death in the US.Cardiac Cells vs Skeletal CellsThere is a plateau in cardiac cells.The plateau is caused by slow voltage gated channels that carry calciumBoth cardiac and skeletal conduction involve fast voltage gated Na+ channels that cause the rapid initial spike.Where they differ is the involement of slower voltage-gated Calcium channels with cardiac cells.Phases of the Cardiac Action PotentialPhase 0: DepolarizationPretty counter-intuitive &#8212; You&#8217;d think it&#8217;d be phase 1!Opening of the fast sodium channels once the threshold potential is reached.Sodium rapidly enters the cell.Phase 1: Early repolarizationClosure of the fast sodium channelsOpening of the potassium channels &#8594; K+ leaves cells.Phase 0 and Phase 1 are the same as what you&#8217;d see in a neuron!Phase 2: PlateauOpening of slow calcium channels &#8594; Ca2+ enters cells.This is what causes the plateau that makes cardiac action potentials different!Phase 3: Late repolarizationClosure of calcium channels.Continued flow of potassium out of the cell.Phase 4: Resting membrane potentialRhythmicityNot all cardiac action potentials look like the same!The heart can beat endogenously without any external input.There must be a part of the heart that can fire by itself, without the aid of anything else!These are termed pacemaker cells &#8594; the pacemaker area of the heart.These have a higher resting potential compared to ventricular muscle fibres.Hence, they are closer to a threshold to generate an action potential!They are also more leaky, so they are more sensitive to fluctuations in charge.The Sino-Antrial (SA) NodeThe Sino-atrial node (Sinus node) is the heart&#8217;s natural pacemaker.It&#8217;s endogenous rate is around 110 bpm, but external factors can modify this!But other parts of the heart have the capacity to pace. It&#8217;d be a bad idea if there wasn&#8217;t &#8594; Always have a backup plan!Why is the SA node the pacemaker then?It beats faster because the resting potential &#8593; (around -55 to -60 mV)Greater leakiness to positive ions into the cell also contributes to this faster rate.The backup parts of the heart generally work at a slower rate &#8594; the pacemaker region is determined by the fastest beating area.If the SA node fails, then the next fastest region takes over. Generally, the next fastest region is the AV Node.If that then fails, regions in the His-Purkinje System can take over.A ventricular escape rhythm can occur if the heart starts relying on a region of the heart in the ventricular region to do the pacing.There are 3 big regions where pacing occurs. In detail:If the SA node is being relied on, the heart is in sinus rhythm.If the AV node is being relied on (or anything in that junction), the heart is in junctional rhythmIf anywhere in the ventricles is doing the pacing (eg. the His-Purkinje system), the heart is in ventricular rhythmIf you want to improve pacing because of loss of the SA node, a pacemaker can be used!Transmission of DepolarizationCell-to-cell conduction is normally caused by the fast-acting flow of Na+ out of the myocytes.However, at the AV Node, conduction occurs through slow flow of Ca2+. This is why conduction through the AV node slows down the electrical signal!Conduction normally has to pass through the AV Node because it&#8217;s the only conductive spot in the atrio-ventricular wall &#8212; the rest is occupied by the insulating mitral and tricuspid valves!PacemakersPacemakers have this small disc placed under the skin, from which wires come out.The wires tunnel through the right subclavian vein &#8594; SVC &#8594; RA or RV.The wires generally stimulate the RA, RV or both.Wires are rarely implanted on the left side &#8594; it&#8217;s difficult/dangerous to implant anything there. This often involves opening up the chest, and putting it on the epicardium (vs. the endocardium for right sided implants)The pace that the pacemaker is set to can be programmed!It can also respond to changes in rhythm, ie. it can function as a defibrillator.Temporary PacingTemporarily, we can improve pacing with a defibrillator. If you turn the knob on the defibrillator one way, it&#8217;ll deliver a shock. But if you turn it the other way, it can actually deliver paced beats through the chest, to stimulate the heart externally.If you&#8217;re awake, obviously this would hurt. But it saves your life, can&#8217;t complain!We can often also insert a temporary pacemaker that is more rapidly installed.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/15/cardiac-electrical-physiology.html"},
	{"title": "BP Regulation &amp Vascular Flow", "text": "Factors determining the design of the circulatory system, such as the distance of diffusion, fluid pressure, and distribution. Reflex arcs, such as the baroreceptor reflex, are also discussed.The Design of the Circulatory SystemWhat does the circulatory system need to do?Transport system for cellular needsHormones must be secreted and transported.The heart in particular secretes atriopeptin, also known as atrial natriuretic peptide/factor (ANP/ANF) which regulates sodium.Transport of heatRemoval of waste products.As a transport systemThe circulation aims to get blood close to the tissue needing it!Diffusion occurs across several &#181;m (max around 300 &#181;m)How do we manipulate the circulatory system?Change the rate of blood flow.Change the concentration of the blood.Change the relative distribution of blood. Recall that the systemic circulation is in parallel &#8212; we can redistribute flow across each parallel branch!DiffusionThe diffusion distance for oxygen in the lungs is around 1 &#181;m. This makes it very efficient!At the tissue level, it&#8217;s around 25 &#181;m, which is also well within that 300 &#181;m distance!The Design of the CirculationRecall that the organs are in parallel.The heart and the lungs are in series, so 100% of the cardiac output passes through the heart and lungs.The overall control is regulated by the autonomic nervous system.Local control is managed by metabolites, hormones, and O2In the figure on the right, oxygen supply is in blue, and oxygen demand is in orange (in percentages).Note that for the coronary circulation, only 5% of the blood is supplied, but 65% of the oxygen supplied is being used! Hence the safety window in the heart is lower than say, for the brain.Organs with narrow safety windows are generally more vulnerable to ischemia!Lymphatics return excess fluid back into the circulation.Series versus Parallel OrgansIt&#8217;s physiologically more advantageous to have our system wired in parallel to reduce total resistance.It also allows us to independently regulate each branch of the circuit, as we discussed before.Delivery RegulationRecall that Flow (CO) = &#916;P/Resistance. (Since P = F &#215; R)Analogous to Ohm&#8217;s Law, I = V/RHence, each organ can regulate its own blood supply by regulating its resistance.To assess blood flow, we use mean blood pressure.The veins are approximately 20 times more compliant than the arteries, so they act as a capacitance pool!The autonomic nervous system regulates both cardiac output and total peripheral resistance, so it can control flow.If we vasocontrict the precapillary sphincter, there will be a greater falloff in pressure across the arterioles, decreasing pressure at the capillaries, and decreasing flow.Alternatively, if we vasodilate, there will be more pressure at the capillaries, and hence more flow.We saw this in the previous lecture, when we discussed how hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries can be regulated with acute blood loss, by vasoconstricting the pre-capillary vessels.Hence, regulating resistance can be used to regulate fluid loss at the capillary bed!See the following link on Starling's Relationship for more info.Factors influencing ResistanceFlow in the center is faster than at the edge.How do we measure the &#8216;mean flow&#8217; in a tube? We integrate the different flow values cross-sectionally!Constrictions introduce turbulence!This is summarized into the following relationship:	Poiseuille's Law	&#951; = Blood Viscosityl = LengthR = Resistancer = Vessel RadiusHence resistance is directly proportional to viscosity and tube length, and inversely related to the 4th power of the radius of the vessel.ie. if r &#8594; 2r, then the resistance would decrease by 16.Consequently, the most important factor is the radius, which is what is predominantly regulated in the body!Factors increasing TurbulenceHigh Blood ViscosityLow Blood ViscosityObstructions (Sources of Sounds)Narrowed OrificesPlaquesBranch PointsThe Effect of Hematocrit on ResistanceThe hematocrit gives us some idea of how viscous the blood will be. Consequently, it will affect turbulence, and resistance.Recall from Blood that it&#8217;s the volume of packed RBCs divided by the total volume.Normal Hct values are around 45% in men, 40% in women.Why is the viscosity not 1 (equal to water), when the Hct is 0?Because there are other proteins in the blood! For instance, albumin in the plasma. (recall, serum = plasma - clotting factors)Regulating Vascular ResistanceVascular Smooth Muscle uses calcium-mediated contraction, via voltage gated channels. This directly leads to muscle contraction.Calcium also serves as a secondary messenger that increases other factors, that leads to vasoconstriction.Ca2+ &#8593; &#8594; vasoconstrictionCa2+ &#8595; &#8594; vasodilationSystemic Blood Pressure ControlAcute versus Chronic Blood PressuresAcutely, blood pressure is controlled by the autonomic nervous systemChronically, blood pressure is controlled by renal and hormonal mechanisms, although the autonomic nervous system may still play a role.SummaryAcute &#8594; autonomic nervous systemChronic &#8594; renal, hormonal mechanismsAcute Blood Pressure ControlLots of negative feedback mechanisms are involved here!For instance, there are aortic baroreceptors along the arch of the aorta, as well as along the carotids.These baroreceptors sense pressure!Sometimes we can actually massage the carotid arteries to reduce heart rate!Why does this work? The baroreceptors sense this as increased pressure &#8594; sends a signal to the heart reducing the heart rate to compensate. (reducing CO, thus reducing pressure)The aortic baroreceptors feed into the vagusThe carotid baroreceptors feed into the glossopharyngeal, via Hering&#8217;s nerve.The baroreceptors exert their effect on the circulation by changing the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.Sympathetic &#8593;&#8594; HR &#8593;, contractility &#8593;Parasympathetic &#8593;&#8594; HR &#8595;, contractility &#8595;Baroreceptor &#8594; brain stem &#8594; interneuron &#8594; sympathetics/parasympathetics.The decision to innervate the sympathetic/parasympathetic systems is made at the interneuron level in the brain!Clinical CaseCase Summary30 y/o FemaleFell from 3rd floor balconySustained displacement of C5, C6.No other major injuriesPreviously well, no medications.On exam:BP: 70/30HR: 45RR: 26Temp: 37.0 &#176; CUrine output: &lt; 20cc/hrNo movement/sensation below the collar line.Why is she in shock and what type of shock is this?Recall that sympathetic conduction occurs along the sympathetic chain, while parasympathetic conduction does not. Hence a spinal cord injury would affect sympathetic responses, but not parasympathetic responses.The injury above T1-T4, around C5-C6, affects nerve conduction distal to C5/C6.Even with a normal baroreceptor response, the sympathetic nerve signal can&#8217;t travel effectively down the sympathetic chain!Now we have an imbalance in sympathetic/parasympathetic signals!This causes the hypotension and bradycardia! Since the parasympathetic system dominatesThis type of shock is called neurogenic shock.To treat this, we can give them fluid to compensate for their vasodilation, and give medications that would increase sympathetic tone (eg. exogenous catecholamines)What if the input from the baroreceptors was cut off, instead of being cut off at the sympathetic chain?Then the brain would assume that the pressure would be very low, and it would try to increase the HR, and contractility, to compensate.Reflex Arcs Regulating Blood Pressure1. The Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone System (RAAS)This is a slightly slower acting reflex that the baroreflex, so it&#8217;s somewhat more chronic response.It helps keep your blood pressure up.This system regulates urine outputSay your blood pressure falls:An area of the kidney senses this (the juxtaglomerular apparatus), and forms reninRenin triggers conversion of Angiotensinogen &#8594; Angiotensin I &#8594; Angiotensin IIAngiotensin II then acts on the adrenal cortex, and triggers the release of AldosteroneAldosterone triggers salt retention, which maintains circulating volume.This reduction in fluid loss correspondingly aims to increase blood pressure again!Angiotensin I and Angiotensin II are also vasoconstrictors themselves!Hence we not only reduce fluid loss from the kidneys, but we also increase vascular resistance, and since P = F &#215; R, if R &#8593;, then P &#8593;Also, precapillary vasoconstriction reduces hydrostatic pressure across the capillary bed, which as we saw before, reduces flow out of the capillaries.The Juxtaglomerular ApparatusThe Juxtaglomerular Apparatus is the source of prorenin. As the blood pressure falls, prorenin is converted to renin, which triggers the RAAS system.RAAS = BP&#8595; &#8594; Prorenin &#8594; Renin &#8594; Angiotensinogen &#8594; Angiotensin I &#8594; Angiotensin II &#8594; Aldosterone &#8594; Sodium retention2. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)Another example of how the body responds to low circulating volume or excesses/deficits of water, is antidiuretic hormone (ADH).For instance, say a patient is dehydrated, and has water loss:Because of this, his extracellular osmolarity goes up (same amount of ions, less fluid).This change is detected by osmoreceptors.The osmoreceptors trigger ADH release from the posterior pituitaryThis increases the amount of circulating ADH.ADH acts at the kidney level to increase the H2O permeability in the distal tubules &amp; collecting ductsThis increases H2O reabsorption!This decreases the amount of H2O that is excreted.This is another example of a feedback loop!This is one reason why you have a hangover! Alcohol inhibits the function of ADH, so it prevents the reabsorption of water! This means you have very dilute urine, which makes you very dehydrated &#8594; hangover!3. Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)Atrial Natriuretic Peptide is talked about less frequently because we don&#8217;t have medications that can effectively regulate its function.ANP is released by atrial muscle cells in response to stretchHence, if we have a volume overload &#8594; the atria become stretched &#8594; ANP is released!ANP then increases the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), and decreases sodium resorption in the collecting ducts.Together this results in a reduction of blood volume because of increased loss of fluid through the kidneys.Local Control of Vascular ResistanceHow does the body locally regulate resistance to change flow through different organs?The Metabolic HypothesisVasodilation occurs because of the accumulation of metabolites that trigger vasodilation (such as H+, K+, adenosine).These metabolites are influenced by the oxygen saturation, which also reflects metabolic activity.Hence, when we have locally high metabolic activity, we accumulate these metabolites &#8594; R&#8595; &#8594; flow&#8593;Thus, we have an increase in flow in response to metabolite accumulation, at the precapillary sphincter!This is an active regulation of vascular resistance.Autoregulation of Blood FlowWe can maintain constant flow over a fairly broad spectrum of blood pressures.Transiently, if the blood pressure changes, there is an immediate change in flow to the tissue.However, fairly rapidly, this metabolite response brings the flow response curve back to where it was before.Anticipatory RegulationWe saw above that we do have a transient change in flow before feedback systems can respond.To avoid this, we can actually have anticipatory regulation, where we modify flow before movement via the autonomic nervous system.Reactive HyperemiaReactive regulation: a response &#8216;after the fact&#8217;For instance, recovery after blood flow occlusion (like when you squeeze your wrist)We actually have an excess of blood immediately after reperfusion!If this response is too dramatic, you can actually have injury, eg. ischemia/reperfusion injury in the heart.The strength of this reperfusion is proportional to how long it was left ischemic! (See the below figure).Endothelium Derived Relaxation Factor (NO)This factor is actually nitric oxide (NO) &#8212; a gas!!NO is produced by a nitric oxide synthase, which takes L-arginine &#8594; NO + L-citrullineNitric Oxide then triggers the release of cGMP, which causes vasodilationThis is actually used in Viagra, where active vasodilation is used to sustain penile erection!Also related to the therapeutic use of nitroglycerine for angina pectoris.It is also the pathophysiology for Septic Shock, where massive amounts of Nitric Oxide are released!A pathogen triggers an inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase &#8594; &#8593;&#8593;&#8593; NO.This causes significant vasodilation, and a leaky endothelium.Cytokines like TNF, and IL-1 are then released, triggering an inflammatory response (recall I&amp;I)!Nitric Oxide is combated by Endothelin, which is a long lasting vasoconstricting peptide.SummaryEndothelium Dependent Relaxation Factor = Nitric Oxide, and is produced in the endothelium.NO causes vasodilation.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/14/bp-reg-vascular-flow.html"},
	{"title": "The Heart as a Pump I", "text": "The determinants of cardiac output are heart rate and stroke volume. Stroke volume itself depends on preload, afterload and contractility. The effect of preload will be discussed here.Cardiac OutputThe Determinants of Cardiac OutputRecall that Cardiac Output = Heart Rate &#215; Stroke VolumeThe stroke volume depends on three things:Preload: The volume that the ventricle is starting with.Afterload: The tension it&#8217;s producing in order to eject.Contractility: The intrinsic contractility of the heart.Assessing Cardiac OutputFor instance:HR = 78 beats/minSV = 76 mL/beatCO = HR &#215; SV = 78 beats/min &#215; 76 mL/beat = 5.93 L/minThe canonical cardiac output is 5 L/minHowever, this varies depending on size!To normalize cardiac outputs with respect to size, we use a cardiac index.The cardiac index is the cardiac output divided by a body surface index (BSA).The BSA is obtained by using a formula factoring in height and weight (of which there are many approximations).For instance:79 kg, 173 cm maleBSA = 1.92 m2Cardiac Index = CO/BSA = 3.1 L/min/m2SummaryCardiac Index = CO/BSAAssessing ResistanceWe saw before that Pressure = Flow (CO) &#215; ResistanceBy rearranging, we obtain: R = P/COFrom this we obtain that:Systemic Vascular Resistance = (MAP - CVP)/COPulmonary Vascular Resistance = (PAP - LAP)/COWhere:MAP = Mean Arterial Pressure, as beforeCVP = Central Venous PressurePAP = Pulmonary Arterial PressureLAP = Left Atrial PressureHeart RateControl of Heart RateThe pacemaker of the heart is the Sinoatrial Node (SA node)It sets the heart rate.The normal resting HR for the SA node is around 110.However, our parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system can regulate this heart rate.For instance, parasympathetic enervation by the vagus nerve can act to reduce our heart rate to around 70-80In an athlete, this can be even lower &#8594; 50-60, because of increased parasympathetic enervation.The sympathetic nervous system acts to increase heart rate via catecholamines like epinephrine.In a Heart TransplantIn the case of a heart transplant, since everything is denervated, the HR can&#8217;t be regulated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system! Hence their resting rate is around the 110 bpm set by the SA node!However, the heart can still respond to exercise and increase its HR by sensing circulating catecholamines (ie. epinephrine)SummaryOur HR pace is set by the SA node, to be around 110.Parasympathetic enervation by the vagus nerve &#8595; HRSympathetic enervation &#8593; HRWhat is the Optimal Heart rate?Recall that CO = HR &#215; SVNaively speaking, increasing either the HR or SV independently would increase the cardiac output.However, the HR and SV are not independentFor instance, an increase in HR may not necessarily &#8593; SV!Consequences of an Increase in Heart Rate1. Increase in ContractilityThe Force-frequency relationship, also known as the &#8217;Bowditch&#8217; or &#8217;treppe&#8217; phenomenon, states that an increase in the heart rate increases the force of contractionAn increase in HR is associated with an increase in contractility, but:This plateaus at a maximum rate.This is not as effective in a failing ventricleHence, in a failing heart, increasing the HR is not as effective in improving cardiac output.2. Decreased Diastolic TimeAs the HR increases, the time in diastole decreases relative to systole.Although systolic times can fall too, the brunt of the time loss comes in diastole. Systolic times are physiologically more rate limited.This can sometimes affect diastolic filling!Abnormal Heart RatesRecall that CO = HR &times; SV, so if HR &darr;, SV must &uarr; to compensateBradycardia = HR too lowBradycardia can result in low cardiac output if stroke volume doesn&#8217;t compensatorily increaseTachycardia = HR too highAs we saw before, there is less time for diastolic fillingThis also means that the heart must work harder, which increases myocardial oxygen consumptionAlso, since the pressures in the LV are so high, perfusion via the coronary arteries can only really occur during diastole, when pressures are lower. Hence LV perfusion mainly occurs during diastole.As a consequence, HR &#8593; results in increased oxygen demand as well as reduced oxygen supply to the LV.This increases the risk of ischemia both by increasing O2 demand and reducing O2 supply.The RV is less at risk because it produces much lower pressure, so it can be perfused during systole.Hence, both bradycardia and tachycardia can be bad!In patients that are increasing in age:There is a decrease in maximal HRThe aorta gets stifferThe ventricle becomes less compliant (stiffer)Decrease in maximal O2 consumption, and consequently, exercise tolerance.Stroke VolumeStroke volume can be affected by three things:PreloadAfterloadContractilityPreloadThe definition of preload is the end diastolic volume.Hence, preload is the maximal volume of blood in the ventricle!Typically refers to the LV, but can sometimes be the RV.Starling&#8217;s LawStarling&#8217;s Law of the Heart can be interpreted in two ways &#8212; with respect to the muscle fibres, and with respect to the heart itself.For Muscle fibresContractile energy is related to the length of the muscle fibre.The same thing applies to cardiac fibres! There is an optimal sarcomere length for contractility.Beyond the optimal length, there is no increase in tension produced.In fact, past 100% length, the tension may actually decrease! Your cardiac fibres can overstretch!For the HeartAn increase in preload (EDV) increases stroke volume.This is the same concept as Starling&#8217;s law for muscle fibres, except applied to the heart.Note: as before, there is a plateau once the EDV passes a certain point. Assessing Preload ClinicallyYou can&#8217;t easily measure or monitor preload because volume is difficult to measure clinically.What confuses people as to the definition of preload is that we often use surrogate markers for volume, namely pressure.If the pressure is high, we assume the volume is high!Preload &#8595; - the heart is underfilled.Preload &#8593; - too much stretch can result in decompensation of the ventricle.Excessive preload can also cause congestion and backflow from the LV.Recall that one way we assess pressure is with the JVP (Jugular Venous Pressure), which is a measure of the height of the pulsatility of the jugular vein, and an assessment of the pressure in the right side of the heart.ECGs (ultrasounds) can actually allow us to directly measure volumes &#8594; lets us assess the true preload!Frank Starling CurvesA population of people will have a family of Frank-Starling Curves &#8212; there is no &#8216;archetypical curve&#8217;These curves will shift in response to heart failure.In a normal heart:There is a good increase in SV in response to preloadIn a failing heart:The curve is shifted down, suggesting a reduced SV response to an increase in preload.We can actually use medications to shift the curve!For instance, there are drugs that improve contractility, and increase the response to preload &#8594; shifts the curve to the left.Determinants of PreloadBlood volumeVenous toneVentricular complianceAfterloadContractilityAtrial contractionIntrathoracic pressureBlood VolumeThis is pretty obvious.The more &#8216;stuff&#8217; you have in your system, the more &#8216;stuff&#8217; should be in your pump!Hypovolemia: A decrease in blood volume. Hypovolemia can be absolute or relative:Absolute: An reduction in circulating blood volume. (eg. by dehydration)Relative: A decrease in the blood volume : systemic volume ratio. For instance if a patient has sepsis, and undergoes vasodilation.Oftentimes, we can have both absolute and relative hypovolemia! Both can happen simultaneously!Venous ToneRecall that the veins and venules are the &#8216;capacitance vessels&#8217; of the circulation!If the veins lose tone, and get dilated, a significant portion of your circulating blood can get &#8216;stuck there&#8217;!An example of this is when you&#8217;re standing up! Blood will collect in distal veins, and effectively lower preload.Hence, when a patient has a weak pulse, we often lay them down or even put pillows under their legs.Atrial ContractionRecall that atrial systole is the &#8216;final kick&#8217; that fills up the ventricle.Hence it&#8217;s sometimes called the atrial kick.Problems with atrial contraction (eg. atrial fibrillation), or reduced time in diastole because of tachycardia, can affect preload!Sick ventricles often do not relax well (recall that it&#8217;s energy dependent!) &#8212; so atrial contraction is critical!Effect of Intrathoracic PressureIf you have a high intrathoracic pressure, you put pressure on your veins, which applies pressure on the vessels bringing blood back into your heart.When you breathe in, the diaphragm pulls down, drawing air in with negative pressure. This reduces intrathoracic pressure (since the size of the cavity increases)In pneumothorax, where there&#8217;s a hole in the lung, where gas escapes, and fills up the area between the lung and chest wall.If this gas fills the area rapidly, it can increase intrathoracic pressure so quickly, that it stops blood return to the heart! That&#8217;s how people die from pneumothorax! This is called a tension pneumothorax.When people break their ribs and it punctures a lung, a tension pneumothorax is often how they die!To treat it, you insert a tube in from the side of the chest, to let the gas escape.ExampleCase SummaryAcute injury with blood lossPreviously well, no medical problemsNo medications, no allergiesWhat will his vitals look like?Heart Rate: &#8593; to try to increase cardiac output!Blood Pressure: &#8595; because of hypovolemia!Oxygen Saturation: &#8212;, no changeRespiratory Rate: &#8593; because of their fight-or-flight sympathetic response.Temperature: &#8212;, generally normal.Urine Output: &#8595;, since the body attempts to maintain fluid by reducing urine output.How will he be compensating for his blood loss?We saw that urine output decreases to preserve blood volume.Also HR &#8593; to increase cardiac output, both directly, and by increasing stroke volume by increasing contractility (recall the force-frequency relationship)Vasoconstriction will occur.How can we help him increase his SV?Give them fluid to improve preload, and hence SV.You should not give them drugs that slow their heart rate. If they have a physiological tachycardia, then it&#8217;s likely they have it for a good reason! You don&#8217;t want to change it unless it&#8217;s pathological!Drugs that maintain heart rate and increase contractility could be used.Could also give drugs that induce vasoconstriction.Note that arteriolar vasoconstriction also decreases fluid loss from capillary beds due to hydrostatic pressure!This is because arteriolar vasoconstriction increases the pressure damping effect of the arteries, reducing the pressure gradient over the capillaries, reducing hydrostatic pressure.The opposite effect happens in post-capillary veins &#8212; vasoconstriction increases resistance in the capillaries, and since P = CO &#215; R, the hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries increases, and fluid leaks out.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/14/heart-pump.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Cardiac Physiology II", "text": "Systolic Failure and Diastolic Failure are two possible outcomes where cardiac output is pathologically reduced. In systolic failure, we have a dilated ventricle, while in diastolic failure, we have a stiff one.Pressure Volume LoopsPressure volume loops can help you visualize the physiology behind the cardiac cycle.Pretty intuitive, map pressure and volume on different axes.We can&#8217;t actually obtain these loops clinically, because it&#8217;s difficult to measure volumes in real life! Pressure is much easier though.The straight lines up and down in the loop represent isovolumetric contraction and relaxation, since volume remains constant.Systolic FailureDuring systolic failure, you have a dilated ventricle, so the EDV would increase.You would also have an decrease in the stroke volume, as well as a decrease in the ejection fraction.Hence the volumes before and after contraction would increaseSince the blood isn&#8217;t being pumped out effectively, it will increase left ventricular pressure, causing backflow that works its way back to the left atrium, and back to the lungs, putting the patient at risk for pulmonary edema (alveolar flooding).What if we had right ventricular systolic failure? Then we would have back up flow to the liver! Recall that this may present with nutmeg liver, because of congestion and cirrhosis! This may also cause edema in the legs!SummaryLV Systolic Failure &#8594; backflow into lungs &#8594; pulmonary edemaRV Systolic Failure &#8594; backflow into the liver and legs &#8594; liver congestion (and possibly cirrhosis in more chronic stages), and edema in the legsMay also have fatigue and reduced exercise capacity because of reduced capacity for the heart to adapt to physiological change.Diastolic FailureRecall that we mentioned that a patient can have heart failure with a normal ejection fractionThis was diastolic failure. Here, because the ventricle is thickened and stiff, the cavity is small, so although the ejection fraction is normal, you&#8217;re ejecting a normal fraction of almost nothing!Here, the patient may have pulmonary edema (one of our big signs of heart failure), with normal systolic function.Instead, the patient has abnormal diastole/relaxation.For instance, if the ventricle is stiff (noncomplliant), then it&#8217;ll increase pressure in the atria for the same volume, as it&#8217;s harder to refill the ventricles.Hence we see an increase in the EDP for the same EDVThis will back up flow into the atria, and into the lungs and liver.Here we see the elevation in EDP for the same EDV, due to ventricular stiffening, that reflects diastolic failure. This is very different from systolic failure, where the LV actually becomes dilated because it can&#39;t pump all the blood out, so the loop shifts to the rightNormal Heart PressuresAorta: 120/80, our classical systolic/diastolic pressures.Right Atrium: 0-4Left Atrium: 5-7Right Ventricle: 25/4Left Ventricle: 120/10Measuring Aortic PresuresSystolic PressureDichrotic NotchDiastolic PressureMean arterial pressurePulse PressureMean Arterial Pressure (MAP)Does NOT = (SBP + DBP)/2Where SBP = Systolic Blood Pressure, and DBP = Diastolic Blood Pressure.Hence a pressure of 120/80 does NOT have a MAP of 100!This is because we spend more time in diastole, so it&#8217;s weighted more!The actual equation is:MAP ~= DBP + (SBP - DBP)/3This makes sense &#8212; the diastolic is weighted twice as much as the systolic. That is, this is equivalent to:MAP ~= DBP &#215; (2/3) + SBP &#215; (1/3)This makes the assumption that we&#8217;re working with a normal heart rate, where the time in diastole is approximately twice the time in systole. Obviously, if your heart rate goes up, the time in diastole would shrink, so the MAP equation would change!MAP can be directly measured by a NIBP cuff or invasive arterial monitoring.Pulse Pressure (PP)PP = SBP - DBPFor instance, if a patient is 120/80, the PP is 40.If a patient is vasodilated, then the pulse pressure will generally be higher because of a lower diastolic pressure.Patients with reduced cardiac output or shock will have vasoconstriction, which will lower the pulse pressure!Generally:PP &#8595; with a decrease in cardiac output (SBP &#8595;)PP &#8593; with an increase in vascular resistance (SBP &#8593; to compensate for resistance)Measuring Venous PresuresCentral Venous Pressure (CVP)With respect to the right atrium and CVP:a wave: atrial contraction causes pressure increase in the veins.c wave: early ventricular contraction causes back pressure on the valves, pushing them back a bit and bumping up the pressure.v wave: atrial pressure just before the aortic valve opens.Note that when we&#8217;re looking at the jugular venous pressure and the central venous pressure, we&#8217;re looking at the right side of the heart, since they empty into the right atrium!To measure the central venous pressure, we often insert a catheter into the jugular or subclavian veins, and continuously measure the CVP.Can give an indication of intravascular volume, but volume and pressure are not the same!Patients can have a low JVP but otherwise be clinically normal, or have a high JVP but be hypovolemic (eg. if you have RV failure, which causes backflow into the jugular. Then the JVP is elevated or normal, but the patient can still be hypovolemic)Measuring Right Sided PressuresPulmonary Artery CatheterWe can insert a catheter into the pulmonary artery, by going through the SVC &#8594; RA &#8594; tricuspid &#8594; RV &#8594; right pulmonary artery.Note that as we enter the right ventricle, the systolic increases &#8216;significantly&#8217; (for the right side of the heart), to around 25.Once we flow into the pulmonary artery, the diastolic blood pressure increases, so long as the pulmonary veins are normal and collect blood.To get to the left side of the heart, you would have to go back from an artery into the aorta, and enter through the aortic valve.Heart SoundsGenerally, we shouldn&#8217;t hear any valves opening, unless they have severe mitral stenosis &#8212; opening snapS1: Closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves.S2: Closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves - Since the left side of the heart is a higher pressure system, the aortic valve closes first. Sometimes this can present as a split sound &#8594; S2P2Extra Heart SoundsS3: Right after the closing of the aortic valve. Would be heard in patients with heart failure. It is caused by having a baggy, loose left ventricle, that fills rapidly, causing turbulent flow.S4: Right before the closing of the tricuspid and mitral valves. Would be where the atria are contracting, but the ventricle is very stiff and resistant. This causes turbulent flow.Hence S4 is often seen in patients with ventricular hypertrophy or chronic hypertension.SummaryS3: Comes after S2!This occurs right after closing of the aortic valvePresents in patients with heart failure, and is caused by having a dilated LV that forms turbulence with rapid filling.S4: Comes before S1!This occurs right before closing of the tricuspid and mitral valvesWhen the ventricles are stiff, it is more difficult to pump blood from the atria into them, causing turbulent flow.Often presents in patients with ventricular hypertrophy or chronic hypertensionConsequently, the order of heart sounds is S4 &#8594; S1 &#8594; S2 &#8594; S3.S4 is the ken in kentuckyS3 is the see in tennessee", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/14/intro-cardiac-physiology-2.html"},
	{"title": "Introduction to Cardiac Physiology", "text": "An introduction to basic concepts in cardiac physiology, and the phases of the cardiac cycle. These phases include atrial systole, isovolumetric contraction, rapid ejection, reduced ejection, isovolumetric relaxation, rapid filling, and reduced filling.Overview of Blood FlowAnatomically, the right heart lies anterior to the left heart. Hence, in motorcycle accidents, or blunt trauma, right heart contusions are more likely.The atria are collecting chambers.The ventricles are pumping chambers.Blood flows through a series of chambers and valves.The Tricuspid Valve seperates the RA &#38; RV. It has 3 leaflets, hence &#8216;Tricuspid&#8217;.The Mitral Valve seperates the LA &#38; LV. It has 2 leaflets, so it sort of looks like a &#8216;fish mouth&#8217;.The Septum is a muscular wall dividing the left and right ventricles.Pressure in the right side of the heart is generally lower than that on the left side.Valves are normally one directional, ensuring that blood flows in one direction.Problems with valves include the following:Stenosis: Stiffening of the valve.Regurgitation: Also known as insufficiency, where the valve is leaky and has backwards flow.Oxygen DeliveryOxygen Delivery (OD) = Cardiac Output (CO) &#215; O2 Content (OC)Intuitively, this makes sense. The amount of delivered oxygen is the amount of blood output by the heart times the amount of oxygen in that blood.O2 Content = (1) O2 bound to Hemoglobin + (2) Dissolved O2The Dissolved O2 component is generally very small &#8212; most is bound to Hemoglobin.(1): O2 bound to Hemoglobin = O2 Saturation &#215; Hb &#215; 1.34(2): Dissolved O2 = pO2 &#215; 0.03For (1), Hb is the amount of Hemoglobin, in grams, and 1.34 is the mL of O2 carried by 1g of Hemoglobin.For (2), pO2 is the Partial Pressure of Oxygen, and 0.03 is the plasma solubility.Pathways of Blood CirculationThe body has two pathways through which blood circulates: a pulmonary circulation and a systemic circulation.Pulmonary Circulation: The Pulmonary Circulation is the circuit that carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle into the lungs, and oxygenated blood back to the left ventricle. It carries blood from the RV &#8594; PA &#8594; lungs &#8594; PV &#8594; LA.Systemic Circulation: The Systemic Circulation is the circuit that carries oxygenated blood from the heart into the rest of the body, and carries deoxygenated blood back to the heart. It carries blood from the LV &#8594; AO &#8594; body &#8594; VC &#8594; RA &#8594; RV.We know that the flow out of the right ventricle must equal the flow leaving from the left ventricle &#8212; otherwise, there would be an accumulation of fluid somewhere. This is because the RV and the LV are in series.However, there are cases when RVOUT &#8800; LVOUT. One example of this is a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), where there is a hole in the septum, causing backflow from the LV into the RV.The Systemic CirculationThe Systemic circulation allows for organ and tissue perfusion. Unlike the RV and the LV, the systemic circulation is in a parallel arrangement. This allows for autoregulation of the pressure between different branches.The Kidneys get around 25% of the blood in the systemic circulation, as they play a role in filtering blood.The Brain also requires a lot of blood. - The GI tract and the liver are in series. Blood from the GI tract passes into the liver via the Portal Vein. (GI &#8594; Portal Vein &#8594; Liver). The Liver detoxifies and metabolizes the blood, which then enters the systemic circulation.The portal vein may be bypassed with Cirrhosis &#8594; severe liver disease. In that case, the blood goes from the GI directly to the systemic circulation without detoxification, which can cause a variety of problems.Autoregulation allows for the control of blood flow to individual organs. It allows for the maintenance of flow regardless of pressure, within certain limits. - For instance, if the flow &#8595;, then the body will compensate by inducing vasocontriction.Series and Parallel CircuitsPressure = Flow &#215; ResistanceAs shown before, the RV and the LV are in a series arrangement, while the systemic circulation is arranged in parallel.Recall that resistance is calculated differently in a series circuit versus in a parallel circuit:For a circuit in series: For a circuit in parallel: In the Heart, Flow = Cardiac Output, and Resistance = Vascular Resistance. Hence, when the Pressure &#8595;, then either the CO &#8595;, or the vascular resistance &#8595; (eg. Vasodilation). The VasculatureArteriesHigh pressure system.Rapid transit of blood.Distensible (although arterial distensibility decreases as you age).ArteriolesSmaller than arteries.Have very muscular walls &#8592; contribute the majority of the vascular resistance.Because of this resistance, they can regulate circulation to distal capillaries.They can also regulate blood pressure.CapillariesAfter the arterioles, the pressure drops significantly (to around 20 mmHg)The capillaries are individually small, but have a large cross-sectional area, since there are a lot of them.Unlike the pulsatile flow in the arterioles, there is constant flow in the capillaries due to arteriolar dampingCapillaries generally allow for single-file RBC transit, which is why disease states that affect RBC shape or membrane distensibility can cause micro-angiopathic hemolysis.Nutrient exchange occurs at the capillary level.Capillary Refill &#8212; Also known as the nailbed test, is a test used to assess distal circulation. You press down on your nail, and see how long it takes for perfusion to return. A normal time is 2-3 seconds.VenulesVeinsVenules and veins are where most of the blood is contained (around 60%).Low pressure system.Very compliant.High capacitance &#8212; Blood collects in them.Valves prevent venous return &#8212; they keep your blood from flowing backwards.Venous insufficiency is where your valves are failing, and you have backflow.The capacity of our blood vessels along with our blood volume determines our physiological state.VasodilationIn Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response causes systemic vasodilation.Vascular volume &#8593; but blood volume remains constant, hence the patient is relatively hypovolemic.The Tx for this would be to give fluid, especially since septic patients can leak fluid due to histamine-mediated junctional retraction as well.VasoconstrictionIn situations where there is acute blood loss, since the blood volume &#8595;, to maintain BP and CO, we compensate by reducing the vascular volume by vasoconstricting.Vascular PressuresVascular Pressure is highest in the arterioles, but there is low cross-sectional area.Vascular Pressure falls at the capillary level, with a corresponding increase in cross-sectional area.Venules and veins have both a low cross-sectional area and a low vascular pressure.

Can increase by around 6-fold in a young patient in good health.Stroke Volume &#8212; Amount of blood pumped with each beat.Comparatively small. Around 60 mL per beat.Cardiac Output = Heart Rate &#215; Stroke VolumeCardiac Cycle &#8212; The sequence of events in one beat.Systole: Contraction phase.Diastole: Relaxation phase.You can have atrial and ventricular systole, as well as ventricular diastole. (relaxation and filling of the ventricles)Normally when we talk about systole &#38; diastole, we are referring to ventricular systole and ventricular diastoleVentricular diastole is vitally important as well as systole &#8212; it is when the ventricles fill up with blood, and it is also energy dependent.Phases of the Cardiac CycleThere are 7 phases to the cardiac cycle:Atrial SystoleIsovolumetric ContractionRapid EjectionReduced EjectionIsovolumetric RelaxationRapid FillingReduced Filling3 of the phases are systolic phases (2, 3, 4), and 4 of the phases are diastolic phases (1, 5, 6, 7), with respect to the left ventricle.PressureThe top part of the figure on the left shows the pressure curves during the phases of the cardiac cycle.AP = Aortic Pressure (aka. Blood Pressure)LVP = Left Ventricular Pressure. Note that it&#8217;s very different from the AP in Diastole.LAP = Left Atrial Pressure.VolumeThe lower part of the figure shows the volume in the left ventricle. The volume trace for the right ventricle would be the same, since LVOUT = RVOUT, except in pathological conditions.LVEDV = Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume &#8212; aka, the volume in the LV after filling.LVESV = Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume &#8212; aka, the volume in the LV after contraction.ECG TraceFinally, the bottom part of the figure shows the ECG trace. Note that any electrical signals precede the mechanical response.Heart SoundsS1 and S2 are your canonical heart sounds &#8212; the &#8216;lub&#8217; and the &#8216;dub&#8217; respectively.S3 and S4 are your extra heart sounds that may be heard in pathological conditions.Phases of the Cardiac Cycle in Detail1. Atrial SystoleAtrial systole is the contraction of the atria. Atrial systole pushes blood from the atria to the ventricles &#8212; it happens just before the ventricles begin to contract. Hence atrial systole is the last phase of ventricular filling.Note that during Atrial Systole, the LV volume only increases by a little bit! This is counterintuitive &#8212; you would expect more ventricular filling to occur because of atrial contraction.On an ECG, a &#8217;P&#8217; wave can be seen.An S4 abnormal heart sound may be heard here, as it is caused by a stiff ventricle that causes turbulent flow upon atrial contraction.Note that the electrical stimulus on the ECG precedes the response!2. Isovolumetric ContractionAs the pressure in the ventricles exceeds that of the atria, the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid &#38; mitral) close.The closure of the tricuspid and mitral valves produces the S1 heart sound. We generally only hear the closure of valves, not their opening!During isovolumetric contraction, the ventricle contracts, but since all the valves are closed, the volume remains the same. Hence it&#8217;s called isovolumetric contraction!As the pressure in the ventricles increase, the mitral and tricuspid valves actually bow backwards a little bit, which creates a small wave in the atrial pressure. This is known as the c wave (shown in yellow to the right).On the ECG, ventricular contraction electrically is known as the QRS.3. Rapid EjectionRapid ejection occurs when the pressure in the aorta is exceeded, and the pulmonary and aortic valves open. Hence, this begins at the intersection of the LVP and the AP, with respect to the left ventricle. (This is again shown to the right)There is an increase in the aortic/pulmonary pressure after rapid ejection.Around 70% of the blood in the ventricles is ejected at this point, as shown in the rapid dropoff in LV volume in the graph.Note that the LVP and the AP are both increasing at this point. This is because the ventricles are still contracting while ejection is occurring, causing an increase in both the LVP and AP.Also note that the LVP and AP are very similar in a healthy patient. This is because the aortic valve should open with only a small pressure gradient between the LV and aorta. In pathological conditions, such as aortic stenosis, there may be a bigger difference between this LVP and AP.4. Reduced EjectionDuring reduced ejection, we approach the end of systole, and ejection slows.We approach the end systolic volume. (eg. the LVESV)The ventricles begin to repolarize.Since the mitral and tricuspid valves have been closed since the beginning of isovolumetric contraction, atrial filling has been occurring. This increase in blood in the atria causes the pressure to rebound, causing a v wave in the LA pressure (The yellow circle in the figure, not where the v is).Ejection FractionStroke Volume: (SV) Volume ejection during systole. Normal ~ 70 mLEnd Diastolic Volume: (EDV) The maximal volume in the (left) ventricle, which is at the end of diastole. Normal ~ 120 mLEnd Systolic Volume: (ESV) The volume at the end of systole. Normal ~ 50 mLEjection Fraction: (EF) The ratio of the SV/EDV. How much are we pumping out, divided by how much we started with. The normal ejection fraction is ~ 60 %, so around 60% of the blood in our ventricles is pumped out with each systolic phase.Ejection fractions are in a continuum, so normal/abnormal values are defined in ranges. The EF can be measured with an echocardiogram, nuclear medicine scans, or cardiac catheterization.Normal: 50-60%Moderately Impaired: 30-35%Severe Decrease: &lt; 25%Note: Patients can have heart failure with a normal EF!! This is known as diastolic failure or heart failure with normal ejection fraction5. Isovolumetric RelaxationDuring isovolumetric relaxation, the ventricles relax, and the ventricular pressure decreases.Note that both ventricular contraction and ventricular relaxation are energy-dependent processes!The ventricular volume remains unchanged (It stays at the ESV). Hence this is &#8216;isovolumetric relaxation&#8217;.As the aortic and pulmonary valves close due to reduced ventricular pressure, and corresponding arterial backflow, an S2 sound is produced.Hence S1 occurs at the beginning of isovolumetric contraction, when the tricuspid and mitral valve close, and S2 occurs during isovolumetric relaxation, when reduced ventricular pressure causes backflow which closes the aortic and pulmonary valves.When the aortic valve closes, there is an incisure or dicrotic notch, because of residual forward momentum of blood even after the valve closes, causing a bump in aortic pressure. This is coincident with S2, which occurs upon pulmonary/aortic valve closure.Note that if &#8216;relaxation&#8217; requires active pumping of calcium pack into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, so if the heart is ischemic, relaxation may be affected as well! This is known as diastolic dysfunction6. Rapid FillingWhen the mitral and tricuspid valves reopen (yellow in the figure), rapid filling occurs because of a buildup of blood in the atria.Blood flows rapidly into the ventricles, which are still relaxing. This causes a rapid increase of ventricular volumeThe atrial pressure correspondingly falls as blood flows out.An S3 heart sound may occur when there is a big baggy left ventricle, where rapid flooding of the LV causes turbulent flow.Hence you may hear an S3 in patients with congestive heart failure and a dilated LV.7. Reduced Filling.There is a gradual increase in ventricular pressure and volume.The pressure in the atria returns to basline.Then at the very end of diastole, we have atrial systole, and we return to systole.Atrial systole is sort of the last push to get blood back into the ventricles.In atrial fibrillation, where the atria do not contract properly, patients still have a reasonably good cardiac output because atrial systole only contributes a small amount to the filling of the ventricles!However, even though atrial fibrillation does not affect cardiac output much, it may increase stagnation of blood flow in the atria, increasing the risk of thrombus formation, and strokes. Hence anticoagulation is often required.In some patients, atrial contraction is much more important. For instance in a patient with a very short diastole, such as with tachycardia, or where the patient has a stiff ventricle that does not relax and fill properly.Notice that there is a significant pressure difference between the LV and the aorta after systole. This means that if the aortic valve is regurgitant, we would have backflow back into the LV. Hence we would have retrograde filling from the aorta, as well as anterograde filling from the LA.Hence in a patient with aortic regurgitation, we would observe a smaller difference in the LVP and the AP.Summary1.

Ventricular DiastoleIsovolumetric relaxationRapid FillingReduced FillingAtrial systoleHow would the cardiac cycle differ for the right ventricle?It would basically be the same, except scaled down because it&#8217;s a lower pressure system!Recall that closing of the tricuspid and mitral valves is coincident, as well as the aortic and pulmonary valve, so you would expect things to be similar!", "tags": "", "loc": "http://kevanlu.github.io/cardiology//2014/01/13/intro-cardiac-physiology.html"},
